{"comment_3": "Stop coddling the super-rich: Buffett http://t.co/1wl9JPJC via @globeandmail", "article": "To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\n\nBack in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n\nPhoto\n\nI didn\u2019t refuse, nor did others.

More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish \"rights\" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are \"an earned right.\" This is true enough in a moral and political sense.

Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.\n\n\n\nThere has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit i", "comment_2": "@ChrisWarcraft According to Supreme Court case of Flemming v.

Did they bring down that Russian plane?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work.

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States.

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers.

Just the facts, all in one place.\n\nWhy did Clinton use her own email account?\n\nWhen Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.\n\nThat is the only reason she used her own account.\n\nHer usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.\n\nAs Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.\n\nWas it allowed?\n\nYes.

Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake.

It's good to be home on this Father's Day with my girls, and it's an honor to spend some time with all of you today in the house of our Lord.\n\nAt the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus closes by saying, \u201cWhoever hears these words of mine, and does them, shall be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.\u201d [Matthew 7: 24-25]\n\nHere at Apostolic, you are blessed to worship in a house that has been founded on the rock of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. But it is also built on another rock, another foundation \u2013 and that rock is Bishop Arthur Brazier.

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing", "comment_2": "The Original \"Woke\" Economist: An Interview with Dr. Thomas Sowell, Part II https://t.co/qylzdLGhXr", "comment_1": "CNN Perhaps Not necessarily flush out of the United States\u2026 https://t.co/l Newark, director of the President Barack Obama\u2019S.co/Kn17Jj6CaudR via @snopes\n\n provoked it was caught the new dinosaur boneTvsoIC on the U.co/DQ3aWR0aDVJTxlL via @Bh", "split": "train", "label": "real", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_comment_1": "CNN Perhaps Not necessarily flush out of the United States\u2026 https://t.co/l Newark, director of the President Barack Obama\u2019S.co/Kn17Jj6CaudR via @snopes\n\n provoked it was caught the new dinosaur boneTvsoIC on the U.co/DQ3aWR0aDVJTxlL via @Bh", "gensraw_comment_1": [[18475, 8674, 1893, 6647, 24774, 504, 287, 263, 1579, 1830, 1400, 3741, 1379, 84, 14, 1074, 15, 76, 30971, 12, 3438, 287, 263, 1993, 8733, 2487, 448, 248, 51, 14, 1074, 15, 25096, 1559, 42, 74, 22, 35, 3886, 50, 2885, 2489, 16185, 13921, 199, 199, 29580, 341, 374, 4979, 263, 650, 28258, 9971, 52, 86, 569, 2150, 320, 263, 472, 14, 1074, 15, 36, 49, 19, 65, 18565, 16, 65, 36, 54, 42, 46048, 76, 44, 2885, 2489, 34, 72, 50260]], "probs_comment_1": [[0.005643954500555992, 0.01141154021024704, 0.013936709612607956, 0.006797498092055321, 0.5180056095123291, 0.8833787441253662, 0.9053996205329895, 0.9167715311050415, 0.2067825049161911, 0.9999244213104248, 0.45358195900917053, 0.9999345541000366, 0.9999982118606567, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9999932050704956, 0.07020946592092514, 2.8735172236338258e-05, 0.9997294545173645, 0.002621169900521636, 0.9290241003036499, 0.6599389910697937, 0.5092016458511353, 0.12835754454135895, 0.9999994039535522, 0.5451104044914246, 0.9921720027923584, 0.47989073395729065, 0.9711892008781433, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999983310699463, 0.20692777633666992, 0.005041021388024092, 0.10912811011075974, 0.003984720911830664, 0.5604296326637268, 0.9889000654220581, 0.7860995531082153, 0.9885815978050232, 0.23195794224739075, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9067347049713135, 0.9981003403663635, 0.9997290968894958, 0.999947190284729, 0.00018841754354070872, 0.9944654107093811, 0.831244170665741, 0.1641385853290558, 0.825475811958313, 0.5424653887748718, 0.011359755881130695, 0.6550368070602417, 1.9574938050936908e-05, 0.04406029358506203, 0.010916847735643387, 0.6086902618408203, 0.14658546447753906, 0.9919393658638, 0.9779683947563171, 0.999970555305481, 0.999160885810852, 0.9999991655349731, 0.5881040692329407, 0.9713765978813171, 0.015826404094696045, 0.7620444297790527, 0.6381657719612122, 0.5676122307777405, 0.987851619720459, 0.8218506574630737, 0.8324221968650818, 0.21841907501220703, 0.43824395537376404, 0.9997528195381165, 0.9923340082168579, 0.9998000264167786, 0.9999954700469971, 0.48519015312194824, 0.961033284664154, 0.8473111987113953]], "summary": "-"}

The president says that his legacy \u201cshould not be diminished,\u201d and that this is the only way he can \u201ckeep an eye\u201d over Trump, as well as future presidents.\n\n\u201cI have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,\u201d said Obama. \u201cI have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.\u201d\n\nThe statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents.

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe true explanation is much less exciting.\n\nPrior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state\u2019s voter rolls.

A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.\n\nMany have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention.
