Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.\n\nJoining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.\n\nGOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.\n\nCORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, \"Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.\"\n\nSenator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?\n\nBROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there.\n\nCORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place.\n\nI think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed?\n\nGOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate?\n\nCORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening.\n\nAnd I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything.\n\nThis is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try to do, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to the floor. I think it's important that we do so.\n\nTAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?\n\nCORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that we voted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement.\n\nSo again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I know Sherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think, again, having this template done first is very, very important. It's very likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach that bipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put in place something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a while until we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block it unless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?\n\nBROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker was part of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. But I also--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for the federal government to come in, and if there is a failing financial system, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown, go on.\n\nBROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'll answer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Street people have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance they can kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been -- two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, Senator Dodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together, including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others and Senator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed was part of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time.\n\nI hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're asking tomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three to simply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I and others can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that they will not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more Bob Corkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very open with negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- Minority Leader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Street lobbyists.\n\nBut put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have this resolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker and Senator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do more to prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and my amendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering next week or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits on the size of these banks.\n\nLet me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago, the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too -- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.\n\nTAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce an amendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to finance operations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventing these banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behind that?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open to negotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They're complicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms where you could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives you two different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, they were just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side.\n\nLook, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the size angle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking at the derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blow up the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600 trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, that are in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you look at the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about the legislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They are important. I do know that the president has laid out what this bill does, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountable the people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, they fail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going to have the strongest consumer protections ever in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we're going to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. But Senator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the American people have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feel that after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer, they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the board members drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses in the Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's no accountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that provides any personal accountability for these CEOs?\n\nCORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something Senator Brown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact is that Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. And the reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I think he wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. I mean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'm my own person and I want to get a good bill here.\n\nBut back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and I think that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolution authority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go through this resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, I think that everything that the executive team and the board members have earned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawed back. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to the management that have caused the country to have to go through this orderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering an amendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawing back all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if it has to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate, and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't make it into the base bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawback provision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, look, in the bill now -- the president went to Cooper Union this last week to revisit the spot where more than two years ago, he went and said we need to have fundamental reform--\n\nTAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill?\n\nGOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. If you get to that point, all the management is fired--\n\nTAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons.\n\nGOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as I say, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details of how we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- and Senator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if the negotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic and we're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep this going so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going to happen. This is going to pass.\n\nCORKER: Well, let me--\n\nTAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject if I could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the big debates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong the derivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets that big money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise or fall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk.\n\nSenator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision, Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank and you have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivatives traders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have any connection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democrats are going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not?\n\nBROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back to really your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clients and serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it's consumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer Protection Agency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it's too-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating out proprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Any of those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and I think that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in the Agriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republican supporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are as open-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Monday night.\n\nAnd again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday vote is going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going to shut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, to me, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then Bob Corker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in terms of in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives that brought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means too big. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see what happens, and then we vote on a bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision to separate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insured deposits?\n\nGOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives is totally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America had even heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their, you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there are now $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that we know virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just a party that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entire financial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed that we are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under the regulatory umbrella.\n\nNow, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd and Lincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged a bunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into the bills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes in that let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten the whole system.\n\nWe can work on the -- so the--\n\nTAPPER: But you guys--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, there are several very technical aspects of difference between the Lincoln bill and the Dodd bill--\n\nTAPPER: It's not really actually that technical, whether or not--\n\nGOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that.\n\nTAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to do this. Senator Corker, I hear you giggling--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little too far, right? Senator Corker?\n\nCORKER: Are you talking to--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker.\n\nCORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan is saying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this, I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. I absolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force those things that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm on the side of let's get as much as possible.\n\nThe fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is that all of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companies hedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if we start drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what we really do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don't think separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much as possible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they have to put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up in the kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers our ability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absolute separation.\n\nTAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a great debate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, Senator Brown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.\n\nAs our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how Saturday Night Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reform to Wall Street executives.\n\nTAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugman of the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at Fox Business News. Thank you all for joining us.\n\nGeorge, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail?\n\nWILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort of sympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it's too big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale, it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what people are arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk to the entire system.\n\nThis is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there's controversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill does but not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argument about whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do.\n\nBoth sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds of failed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholder equity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be most beastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not this happens.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be a bipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that the negotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith in that.\n\nTUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. We saw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was given months to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day there wasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So, you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let's start over with this financial reform bill. That was the very same tactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery of this idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyists time to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives the Republicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. So I think Chris Dodd is very leery.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaign contributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Center for Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and in this cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are giving much more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51 million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to Wall Street?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question that in the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in the administration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed that these were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at this point, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lot more contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising.\n\nLet me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to be bipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reform with possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history of politics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks is actually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils down to saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolish the fire department. Because then people will know that they can't let their buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible.\n\nSo anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisan doesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree with George, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not the problem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of the Bank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-based institution that was the 28th largest financial institution in the United States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down.\n\nBut what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have graceful failure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with small banks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge of failing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don't have a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadow banking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would give you that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicated financial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones, and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with the fail bit.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actually have worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, at Morgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do you think the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln is trying to do, do you think that goes too far?\n\nGLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at the derivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a central clearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We have not been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction.\n\nI do believe that it's going too far to say that large financial institutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don't want to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to go out on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade in derivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too big to fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done a phenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has lost a dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in a very, very smart and effective way. The question here on resolution authority is what--\n\nTAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this -- the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financial institution that's failing. Go.\n\nGLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those other institutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It's the GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals of the world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may be in the manufacturing business or in other business?\n\nWILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think this is a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the government deeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a public utility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, they think, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Because you have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bank financial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought under TARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, or would it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electric brought under this bill?\n\nKRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we only protect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildings with rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern banking system. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there, money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionally play the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economy the same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under the umbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this has to be done.\n\nTAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take up Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be on immigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency. He sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions to Wall Street. Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president, he got one.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: Coming up next, more of the \"Roundtable\" and of course the \"Sunday Funnies.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBREWER: I have decided to sign Senate bill 1070 into law. Order related violence and crimes due to illegal immigration are critically important issue for the people of our state.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are angry. People feel held down.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Federal government isn't doing anything for us. The state has to do something.\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Our border is not secure, our citizens are not safe.\n\nOBAMA: The failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Some sound from the heated debate over Arizona's new immigration law. Fodder for us here on our \"Roundtable.\" We're joined as always by George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" Paul Krugman of the \"New York Times,\" and former vice president of FOX Business News, Alexis Glick.\n\nThat's a mouth full but I got it every time. Let me start before we discuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of the most controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill 1070. \"For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall be made when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person.\"\n\n\"Reasonable suspicion\" that the person is an alien. What does that mean, George?\n\nWILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be no unreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of case law trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. So it's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. They have 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So before Washington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washington ought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty which is to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in the world with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have a magnet of a welfare state to the north.\n\nSo this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be said however. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police of Arizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. \"We must enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent or social status.\" I don't know how do you that.\n\nTAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out an executive order saying that there should be no racial order that there should be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police man and you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under this law if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're a policeman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might be an illegal immigrant?\n\nTUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actually opposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no idea what it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican has said you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Of course this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with a Spanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not be Latino. There are people in my family who look as if they could be Latino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in South Africa were required to carry documents in order to move from one part of town to another.\n\nAnd let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border, it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. A rancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this has absolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doors for harassment of citizens.\n\nTAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His name was Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him, Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in our country that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan in Pakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not just for the Krentz family but for her entire country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federal failure at the border.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically what it comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue of principle, it's just a question of resources. People have been willing to be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to do reasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be a problem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheid issues, but think about a different way.\n\nWe have these massive protests in this country about alleged authoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of -- inside the Obama/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government is encroaching too much in our lives.\n\nAnd now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people, demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of those apocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are saying hand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have to prove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knows what else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula of Brazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk, right?\n\nTAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president of Brazil.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, because you are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing.\n\nKRUGMAN: Right.\n\nTAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, \"American people are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.\"\n\nAnd now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obama talking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, we thought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this is going to be a big issue in Washington.\n\nGLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey, wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. But the bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst, if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving in Washington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it.\n\nI saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh, wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at the conference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is first before we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we're going to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to address immigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got an unemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have to address citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of the pie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get, what services they're going to be offered.\n\nThis is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to address it.\n\nWILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonans support this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, by definition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent people with a huge problem.\n\nWhat the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to do this in a professional way.\n\nTAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations in Arizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, President Obama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'm sorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even before the law was passed.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act at a federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but in addition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether or not they should block this law?\n\nTUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think the Justice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spent the weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the bill itself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civil rights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place for them to look.\n\nBut the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There will be other organizations that have already said that they are planning lawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly.\n\nLet me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thought health care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle, and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's why Speaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first.\n\nTAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has been saying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators who supported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting that they need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it, though.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issues that cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it's on the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they are worried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it is the party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party that generally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many of them divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it's not so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrat tends to be kind of torn about this.\n\nRepublicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservative wing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing, which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck of an issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties, which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agenda right now.\n\nI'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate change off this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'm ready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't do it for quite a few years to come.\n\nGLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is Senator McCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trail and has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but I thought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will this impact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to that Hispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-term elections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very telling sign that in the last hours, he decided to back it.\n\nWILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is that word comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incremental improvements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly because this is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in the country. But if we would close the border, guarantee that we were not going to have serial amnesties far into the future--\n\nGLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests.\n\nWILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find that the American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on the subject, but they do want this essential attribute of national sovereignty asserted.\n\nTUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George?\n\nWILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout.\n\nTUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult than advocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles, George.\n\nTAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We're not trying to keep the Canadians out?\n\nTUCKER: The southern border---\n\nWILL: You're profiling.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh?\n\nTUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can depend on, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. So we're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard, Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off.\n\nKRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is a lot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out at least a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. The Japanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who's not Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants.\n\nGLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was saying to you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this and I said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot of the messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they support this bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNow, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerous precedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and more states, particularly on the border there, are going to have to address this on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue.\n\nTAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly, because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week, we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going to drop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the former speaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as an independent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this his only option?\n\nWILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with other people, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Nelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about six months, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, former Senator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reform bill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popular politician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man.\n\nTAPPER: Paul, very quickly.\n\nKRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. Republican Party has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderately conservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and Charlie Crist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia?\n\nTUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He has always worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always been moderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Party in Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came to Florida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment in video where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist and the Republican Party.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about the stimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus?\n\nGLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example for Republicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't support the stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did support it. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I also think the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party. If the Republicans want to figure out how to embrace Tea Party candidates, here's an example.\n\nTAPPER: All right, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where you can also check out our fact checks.", "comment_3": "Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos anchors a special edition of \u201cThis Week\u201d live from ABC News election headquarter\u2026 https://t.co/H7mDb2Y6yw", "target": "real", "comment_1": "@GregHuntMP @JuliaGillard lost a mother of an autistic child and a child into separate families to #suicide this we\u2026 https://t.co/dHlLZ9u4QD"}
{"split": "train", "comment_2": "How Can President Obama Regain His Political Footing?. #PresidentObama http://bit.ly/MKq5x", "text": "With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground, The Post asked political experts what he could do to regain the initiative. Below are contributions from Scott Keeter, Michael S. Berman, Newt Gingrich, Donna Brazile, Robert J. Blendon, Christine Todd Whitman, Dan Schnur, Ed Rogers, Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Gillespie.\n\nSCOTT KEETER\n\nDirector of survey research at Pew Research Center\n\nPresident Obama had a better honeymoon with the public than either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But it's over now. His ratings are approaching his electoral margin.\n\nThis summer slump is a product of his own actions and political forces outside his control. Obama campaigned for strong government action on the economy and health care, and most of his voters agreed with this direction. But Obama's efforts to expand the role of government have alienated many of those who did not vote for him but nonetheless gave him high marks when first he took office.\n\nPew Research's political values survey this spring showed no surge in public demand for more government. Indeed, anti-government sentiment, which had been building for years, was heightened by the financial bailout and stimulus program. Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few \"green shoots\" -- remains grim.\n\nThe health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party. Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care. Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating. Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's 1994 experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care could also be costly.\n\nMICHAEL S. BERMAN\n\nPresident of the Duberstein Group; former counsel and deputy chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale\n\nFirst, the president should not over-read or over-rely on polls. To get some perspective, check out the Aug. 26 piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research entitled \"A Pollster's Advice: Don't Trust the Polls on Health Reform's Demise.\"\n\nSecond, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential crisis in their personal financial \"systems.\" And that he has heard the concerns raised by affected Americans nationwide. While the media attention to various town halls was in the best tradition of \"if it bleeds it leads,\" most of the people who came out did so out of a real need and interest to learn more about health-care reform proposals.\n\nThird, invite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid to a meeting, just the three of them, and work through with them a plan for going forward. Work \"with\" the congressional leadership to come up with a single bill that represents the doable, sans the wish list of every idea for changing health care that has been suggested in the past several decades. And get to that bill before the process kind of stumbles on to it.\n\nFinally, choose a dramatic forum, perhaps a joint session of Congress, to lay out a bill that includes core changes but reflects having heard what is bothering the people he was elected to lead.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH\n\nFormer Republican speaker of the House of Representatives\n\nWhen he returns from vacation, the president's most important assignment should be to take a deep breath and get a long-term view of the country's reaction to his policies.\n\nSince World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama. His economic policies are not creating jobs. His energy tax is unlikely to pass the Senate. There is an overwhelming rejection of his spending policies.\n\nOn the international front, Afghanistan is proving much harder than expected. Iran is showing no signs of giving up its nuclear program and North Korea is still unyielding.\n\nIn this setting, the left's health program is bitterly dividing the country. Several polls have shown that more Americans expect their personal health-care situation to get worse than to get better under the plan being considered in Congress.\n\nStill, Obama's left-wing advisers want him to undertake the revolutionary act of ramming through massive change for 17 percent of the economy under a narrow budgetary provision. This would be a statement of absolute defiance of the vast majority of Americans.\n\nObama faces a choice: He can attempt to run a left-wing government against the American people. Or he can govern from the center with a large majority of Americans supporting him. He can have either his left angry or the American people angry. We will know in September which choice he has made.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE\n\nAuthor and political commentator; manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign\n\nPresident Obama must reset the national debate and narrow his focus on passing health-insurance reform with or without Republicans. To do this, the president must convince deficit-weary voters that reform will not send the national debt soaring and that higher taxes on the middle class are not just around the corner.\n\nWith everything in his inbox still marked urgent, the president needs to prioritize more and stop trying to do everything at once without also reminding Americans of the sacrifices involved. He should repeat: \"Remember, we're all in this together.\"\n\nObama must also take a chapter from his campaign and begin to work on the \"new politics\" that would allow him to reach bipartisan consensus on a host of major challenges.\n\nMuch of the real anger we are seeing is economic anxiety that ordinary people are experiencing in this jobless recession. The economy is doing better, according to statistics, but nobody feels it yet. That makes for a lot of fear and worry.\n\nThe administration should also keep an eye on the stimulus spending: target funds, track job creation, rebuild the safety net, and eliminate waste and duplicity. With money so tight, no one wants to see the government spending frivolously.\n\nROBERT J. BLENDON\n\nProfessor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's School of Public Health and its Kennedy School of Government\n\nMost Americans do not see the president's economic policies as having been particularly successful for people like themselves, and this is leading to some skepticism about health-care reform. In fact, recent polls show most Americans do not anticipate any aspect of their health care improving if the president's health-reform proposals were enacted.\n\nTo shift this thinking requires two things: The administration's message has to change sharply, focusing on more concrete, practical aspects of reform and how it will improve typical Americans' experiences with health care. Obama needs to present over and over again five specific changes in the legislation that will help the average family, and how they will be paid for. For example, explain why changing the system so families cannot lose their insurance coverage and enacting tough insurance reforms helps families who have coverage today.\n\nSecond, the president needs to make a clear decision this fall about whether he supports a public option competing with private insurance. If so, he must explain how it would function in practice. Americans in the political center are turned off by ideological debates. After all these months, they want him to explain if it is essential and then move on to other issues they see as important.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN\n\nChair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001\n\nIf he wants to regain ground on the health-care debate, climate change and the other legislative initiatives he has identified, President Obama needs to start by rebuilding some bridges within his party. The squabbling among Democrats is bitter, with the attacks from the more liberal end of the party on the more moderate \"Blue Dog\" Democrats reaching a fever pitch. Obama might keep in mind the legacy of Sen. Edward Kennedy and reach out to those Blue Dog Democrats as well as moderate Republicans to find common ground. Kennedy was an ardent partisan with a 90 percent liberal lifetime voting rating from the liberal watchdog group Americans for Democratic Action. No one questioned his commitment to the liberal agenda or his party. Yet few senators have ever authored more bipartisan bills and were known for so consistently reaching across the aisle. The president should refuse to push through legislation on strictly partisan votes and should seek the types of bipartisan compromise he promised to broker.\n\nDAN SCHNUR\n\nDirector of the University of Southern California's Unruh Institute of Politics; communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign\n\nEveryone is drawing political lessons from the life and legacy of Ted Kennedy. But there is one missed opportunity in particular from Kennedy's career that Barack Obama can reflect on to get himself and his administration back on track.\n\nKennedy famously cited his decision to reject President Richard Nixon's health-care reform package as his greatest regret. Although Nixon's proposal was not nearly as ambitious as Kennedy would have preferred, the senator realized over the years that working with Nixon would have led to significant advancements toward his larger goals.\n\nFast-forward to today's battle over health care. It's clear that Obama deserves credit for moving the debate forward and achieving consensus on a number of previously intractable issues. Set aside, for now, the brawls about end-of-life counseling and a publicly funded option. If Obama signed a bill that allows individuals who change jobs to keep their insurance, forbids the denial of coverage for preexisting conditions, and deals with a lifetime cap on benefits, people will throw rose petals at his feet.\n\nImportant progress can be made now on health care; after the most significant reforms in a generation are signed into law, he can still come back to the negotiating table and continue to move forward.\n\nED ROGERS\n\nChairman of BGR Group; White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\n\nWhile the president's effectiveness is eroding, the situation is not dire. He can regain the initiative, but an eloquent speech won't do it. I assume he will not convert to conservatism and abandon his flawed plans, but he should cut his losses and get back to reality.\n\nOccasionally all White Houses contort themselves into situations where they begin to say things they know are not true. The more you say such things, the more you have to keep saying them to try and make them true. But the Obama administration needs to face it: The president's energy bill is not a jobs bill! His health-care plans will lead to government bureaucratic decisions about individuals' heath care and will cost a fortune. The deficit is not under control. The administration should not deny the obvious or defend the indefensible. White House officials know they are losing the public debate on these issues and must scale back to what is possible and credible given America's economic circumstances -- or use brute force in Congress to pass unpopular, harmful and vast new programs.\n\nEven if he did use his congressional majorities to win these battles, the president would lose the war by slowing economic growth, only resulting in more political pain for himself and his party. Obama doesn't have any political problems that a couple of years of 4 percent GDP growth won't solve. But he has to want it, and he needs honest policies to achieve it. Now, though, he is on a course that terrifies his political handlers and his party's candidates.\n\nHAROLD FORD JR.\n\nChairman of the Democratic Leadership Council\n\nEvery president faces a time when poll numbers slide. It's easy to advise a president to ignore the numbers and plow ahead. It's not wise for a president to heed that advice blindly. Thankfully, President Obama knows that politics is about the art of the possible.\n\nObama is battling a stubborn recession, a Republican Congress hell-bent on defeating health reform and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. When he returns to Washington the president should forge a consensus in Congress to pass what \"is possible\" on health reform, redouble his efforts to stimulate job creation, clearly articulate our mission objectives in Afghanistan, and redefine and revive energy and financial services reform.\n\nFirst he needs to win on health reform. Obama has been patient, committed and focused on leading Congress to a consensus. At his core, this president is a pragmatist. In the spirit of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, Obama should work toward winning a compromise here before taking on new reform challenges.\n\nThe compromise should be built around insurance reform, such as prohibiting companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, and guaranteeing coverage for every child in America. Such substantive health reform would put us firmly on path to solving the uninsured problem in this country when our economy gets back on track.\n\nED GILLESPIE\n\nCounselor to President George W. Bush\n\nBarack Obama faces a fundamental decision about the direction of his presidency: Try to muscle through with Democratic votes a much more liberal agenda than many of his voters expected of him, or seek more consensus-oriented policies that attract at least a slice of the House and Senate Republicans by sacrificing core liberal elements of his policies.\n\nIf he chooses the former, he risks spectacular failure or a victory that eliminates the \"postpartisan\" persona that is a critical component of his personal approval ratings. This would make it much more difficult to achieve future legislative goals, in the same way the rushed, forced passage of the stimulus bill has made his health-care policy harder to achieve. And once that critical attribute is lost, it's all but impossible to get back.\n\nTo pull his young presidency back from the brink, and protect his greatest asset, President Obama would be wise to tack back to the center and pull his congressional leadership with him. He can then return his focus to the central issue on which voters are looking to him for leadership -- turning our economy around.", "comment_3": "WSJ reports \"as the president tried to regain his political footing,\" the event \"also featured the largest protests of the Obama presidency\"", "target": "real", "comment_1": "WP-OP: Topic A: How Can President Obama Regain His Political Footing? http://tinyurl.com/l8ath6"}

He outlined his record, his economic plan and how he will bring change when John McCain will bring more of the same. Here are some of his remarks... Over the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\n...So let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\n...Make no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing ... we know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election. Read Barack's full remarks as prepared for delivery...\n\n\n\nRemarks of Senator Barack Obama\n\n\n\nConfronting an Economic Crisis\n\n\n\nAs Prepared For Delivery\n\n\n\nTuesday, September 16th, 2008\n\n\n\nGolden, Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong\n\n\n\nA few hours later, his campaign sent him back out to clean up his remarks, and he tried to explain himself again this morning by saying that what he meant was that American workers are strong. But we know that Senator McCain meant what he said the first time, because he has said it over and over again throughout this campaign \u2013 no fewer than 16 times, according to one independent count.\n\n\n\nNow I certainly don\u2019t fault Senator McCain for all of the problems we\u2019re facing, but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to. Because the truth is, what Senator McCain said yesterday fits with the same economic philosophy that he\u2019s had for 26 years. It\u2019s the philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down. It\u2019s the philosophy that says even common-sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise. It\u2019s a philosophy that lets Washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had this philosophy for eight years. We know the results. You feel it in your own lives. Jobs have disappeared, and peoples\u2019 life savings have been put at risk. Millions of families face foreclosure, and millions more have seen their home values plummet. The cost of everything from gas to groceries to health care has gone up, while the dream of a college education for our kids and a secure and dignified retirement for our seniors is slipping away. These are the struggles that Americans are facing. This is the pain that has now trickled up.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the difference between how Senator McCain and I would govern as President, you can start by taking a look at how we\u2019ve responded to this crisis. Because Senator McCain's approach was the same as the Bush Administration\u2019s: support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely; do nothing as the crisis hits; and then scramble as the whole thing collapses. My approach has been to try to prevent this turmoil.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2006, I introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud, risk or abuse. A year later, before the crisis hit, I warned Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke about the risks of mounting foreclosures and urged them to bring together all the stakeholders to find solutions to the subprime mortgage meltdown. Senator McCain did nothing.\n\n\n\nLast September, I stood up at NASDAQ and said it\u2019s time to realize that we are in this together \u2013 that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street \u2013 and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets. Months later, Senator McCain told a newspaper that he\u2019d love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, \u201cbut\u201d \u2013 he said \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know one.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress. Senator McCain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so-called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut, including $4 billion for the big oil companies, but no immediate help for workers.\n\n\n\nThis March, in the wake of the Bear Stearns bailout, I called for a new, 21st century regulatory framework to restore accountability, transparency, and trust in our financial markets. Just a few weeks earlier, Senator McCain made it clear where he stands: \u201cI\u2019m always for less regulation,\u201d he said, and referred to himself as \u201cfundamentally a deregulator.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is what happens when you confuse the free market with a free license to let special interests take whatever they can get, however they can get it. This is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while Wall Street is booming, and declare \u2013 as Senator McCain did earlier this year \u2013 that we\u2019ve made great progress economically under George Bush. That is how you can reach the conclusion \u2013 as late as yesterday \u2013 that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\nWell, we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy. We know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great \u2013that America is a place where you can make it if you try.\n\n\n\nAmericans have always pursued our dreams within a free market that has been the engine of our progress. It\u2019s a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world, and rewarded the innovators and risk-takers who have made America a beacon of science, and technology, and discovery. But the American economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market\u2019s invisible hand with a higher principle \u2013 that America prospers when all Americans can prosper. That is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair, and open, and honest.\n\n\n\nToo often, over the last quarter century, we have lost this sense of shared prosperity. And this has not happened by accident. It\u2019s because of decisions made in boardrooms, on trading floors and in Washington. We failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices. We let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales. The result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady, sustainable growth; a market that favors Wall Street over Main Street, but ends up hurting both.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: the American economy does not stand still, and neither should the rules that govern it. The evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform - to foster competition, lower prices, or replace outdated oversight structures. Old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices. Old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading. But instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market, too often we\u2019ve excused an ethic of greed, corner-cutting and inside dealing that threatens the long-term stability of our economic system.\n\n\n\nIt happened in the 1980s, when we loosened restrictions on Savings and Loans and appointed regulators who ignored even these weaker rules. Too many S&Ls took advantage of the lax rules set by Washington to gamble that they could make big money in speculative real estate. Confident of their clout in Washington, they made hundreds of billions in bad loans, knowing that if they lost money, the government would bail them out. And they were right. The gambles did not pay off, our economy went into recession, and the taxpayers ended up footing the bill. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nAnd it has happened again during this decade, in part because of how we deregulated the financial services sector. After we repealed outmoded rules instead of updating them, we were left overseeing 21st century innovation with 20th century regulations. When subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn, a patchwork of regulators systematically and deliberately eliminated the regulations protecting the American people and failed to raise warning flags that could have protected investors and the pensions American workers count on.\n\n\n\nThis was not the invisible hand of the market at work. These cycles of bubble and bust were symptoms of the ideology that my opponent is running to continue. John McCain has spent decades in Washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers. In fact, one of the biggest proponents of deregulation in the financial sector is Phil Gramm \u2013 the same man who helped write John McCain\u2019s economic plan; the same man who said that we\u2019re going through a \u2018mental recession\u2019; and the same man who called the United States of America a \u201cnation of whiners.\u201d So it\u2019s hard to understand how Senator McCain is going to get us out of this crisis by doing the same things with the same old players.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 this isn\u2019t 9/11. We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election.\n\n\n\nHistory shows us that there is no substitute for presidential leadership in a time of economic crisis. FDR and Harry Truman didn\u2019t put their heads in the sand, or hand accountability over to a Commission. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t put off hard choices. They led, and that\u2019s what I will do. My priority as President will be the stability of the American economy and the prosperity of the American people. And I will make sure that our response focuses on middle class Americans \u2013 not the companies that created the problem.\n\n\n\nTo get out of this crisis \u2013 and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again \u2013 we must take immediate measures to create jobs and continue to address the housing crisis; we must build a 21st century regulatory framework, and we must pursue a bold opportunity agenda that creates new jobs and grows the American economy.\n\n\n\nTo jumpstart job creation, I have proposed a $50 billion Emergency Economic Plan that would save 1 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, repairing our schools, and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts.\n\n\n\nI worked with leaders in Congress to create a new FHA Housing Security Program, which will help stabilize the housing market and allow Americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford. Going forward, we need to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as we know them with a structure that is focused on helping people buy homes \u2013 not engaging in market speculation. We can\u2019t have a situation like the old S&L scandal where its \u201cheads\u201d investors win, and \u201ctails\u201d taxpayers lose. That\u2019s going to take ending the lobbyist-driven dominance of these institutions that we\u2019ve seen for far too long in Washington.\n\n\n\nTo prevent fraud in the mortgage market, I've proposed tough penalties on fraudulent lenders, and a Home Score system that will ensure consumers fully understand mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments. To help low- and middle-income families, I will ease the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner\u2019s tax credit. This will add up to a 10 percent break off the mortgage interest rate for 10 million households. That\u2019s another $500 each year for many middle class families.\n\n\n\nUnlike Senator McCain, I will change our bankruptcy laws to make it easier for families to stay in their homes. Right now, if you\u2019re a family that owns one house, bankruptcy judges are actually barred from helping you keep a roof over your head by writing down the value of your mortgage. If you own seven homes, the judge is free to write down any or all of the debt on your second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh homes. Now that may be of comfort to Senator McCain, but that\u2019s the kind of out-of-touch Washington loophole that makes no sense. When I\u2019m President, we\u2019ll make our laws work for working people.\n\n\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen the last few days, the crisis in our financial markets now reaches well beyond the housing market. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time to do what I called for last September and again this past March \u2013 and it is only more overdue today.\n\n\n\nOur capital markets cannot succeed without the public's trust. It\u2019s time to get serious about regulatory oversight, and that\u2019s what I will do as President. That starts with the core principles for reform that I discussed at Cooper Union.\n\n\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re a financial institution that can borrow from the government, you should be subject to government oversight and supervision. When the Federal Reserve steps in as a lender of last resort, it is providing an insurance policy underwritten by the American taxpayer. In return, taxpayers have every right to expect that financial institutions with access to that credit are not taking excessive risks.\n\n\n\nSecond, we must reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions. We must strengthen capital requirements, particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities and other derivatives at the center of our current crisis. We must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk. We must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating. And we must establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties. As we reform our regulatory system at home, we must address the same problems abroad so that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road.\n\n\n\nThird, we need to streamline our regulatory agencies. Our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape. Different institutions compete in multiple markets - Washington should not pretend otherwise. A streamlined system will provide better oversight and reduce costs.\n\n\n\nFourth, we need to regulate institutions for what they do, not what they are. Over the last few years, commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies. This regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners, and made no sense for our financial system. When it comes to protecting the American people, it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with.\n\n\n\nFifth, we must crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation. The last six months have shown that this remains a serious problem in many markets and becomes especially problematic during moments of great financial turmoil. We cannot embrace the administration's vision of turning over the protection of investors to the industries themselves. We need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them. The SEC should investigate and punish market manipulation, and report its conclusions to Congress.\n\n\n\nSixth, we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy. Too often, we end up where we are today: dealing with threats to the financial system that weren't anticipated by regulators. We need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the President, Congress, and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face. It\u2019s time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full-blown crisis.\n\n\n\nThese six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a 21st century regulatory system. But the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation. Financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks. There is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers don't understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions. It's time to realign incentives and CEO compensation packages, so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders.\n\n\n\nFinally, the American people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us - not the special interests that have set the agenda in Washington for eight years, and the lobbyists who run John McCain\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve spent my career taking on lobbyists and their money, and I\u2019ve won. If you wanted a special favor in Illinois, there was actually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their own personal use. In the State House, they called it business-as-usual. I called it legalized bribery, and while it didn\u2019t make me the most popular guy in Springfield, I put an end to it.\n\n\n\nWhen I got to Washington, we saw some of the worst corruption since Watergate. I led the fight for reform in my party, and let me tell you \u2013 not everyone in my party was too happy about it. When I proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they\u2019re raising money from and who in Congress they\u2019re funneling it to, I had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the Senate. But we got it done, and we banned gifts from lobbyists, and free rides on their fancy jets. And I am the only candidate who can say that Washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign, they will not run my White House, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President of the United States. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to end the outrage of special interests tipping the scales.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing we must do is restore opportunity for all Americans. To get our economy growing, we need to recapture that fundamental American promise. That if you work hard, you can pay the bills. That if you get sick, you won\u2019t go bankrupt. That your kids can get a good education, and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the change the American people need. While Senator McCain likes to talk about change these days, his economic program offers nothing but more of the same. The American people need more than change as a slogan\u2013 we need change that makes a real difference in your life.\n\n\n\nChange means a tax code that doesn\u2019t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start-ups \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019ll grow our economy and create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI will cut taxes \u2013 cut taxes \u2013 for 95% of all working families. My opponent doesn\u2019t want you to know this, but under my plan, tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan. If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increase one single dime. In fact, I offer three times the tax relief for middle-class families as Senator McCain does \u2013 because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.\n\n\n\nI will finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most\n\n\n\nI will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy. We\u2019ll tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I\u2019ll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I\u2019ll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I\u2019ll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy \u2013 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can\u2019t ever be outsourced\n\n\n\nAnd now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. I\u2019ll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. But in exchange, I will ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American \u2013 if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.\n\n\n\nThis is the change we need \u2013 the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the American economy by advancing the dreams of all Americans.\n\n\n\nTimes are hard. I will not pretend that the changes we need will come without cost \u2013 though I have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way. I know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity.\n\n\n\nBut I am running for President because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for Wall Street instead of Main Street, and ends up devastating both.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings. I don\u2019t want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete, our children\u2019s future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt, and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing.\n\n\n\nThis time \u2013 this election \u2013 is our chance to stand up and say: enough is enough!\n\n\n\nWe can do this because Americans have done this before. Time and again, we\u2019ve battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other\u2019s success. That\u2019s why our economy hasn\u2019t just been the world\u2019s greatest wealth generator \u2013 it\u2019s bound America together, it\u2019s created jobs, and it\u2019s made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of Americans.\n\n\n\nNow it falls to us. And I need you to make it happen. If you want the next four years looking just like the last eight, then I am not your candidate. But if you want real change \u2013 if you want an economy that rewards work, and that works for Main Street and Wall Street; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs; if you want health care you can afford and education so that our kids can compete; then I ask you to knock on some doors, and make some calls, and talk to your neighbors, and give me your vote on November 4th. And if you do, I promise you \u2013 we will win Colorado, we will win this election, and we will change America together.\n\n\n\n", "comment_3": "President Barack Obama's campaign is selling T-shirt on its Web site that show Obama's face on the front with the... http://fb.me/XS7tSBWF", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Rock the Vote with Neil Abercrombie: \nBarack Obama got a ton of press when his campaign Web site was launche.. http://tinyurl.com/69474g"}

You have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time.Let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague, Haleh Esfandiari, and her family. I have made my position known to the Iranian government. It is time for Haleh to be released. It is time for Haleh to come home.Thanks to the 9/11 Commission, we know that six years ago this week President Bush received a briefing with the headline: \"Bin Ladin determined to strike in U.S.\"It came during what the Commission called the \"summer of threat,\" when the \"system was blinking red\" about an impending attack. But despite the briefing, many felt the danger was overseas, a threat to embassies and military installations. The extremism, the resentment, the terrorist training camps, and the killers were in the dark corners of the world, far away from the American homeland.Then, one bright and beautiful Tuesday morning, they were here.I was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown Chicago when I heard the news on my car radio: a plane had hit the World Trade Center. By the time I got to my meeting, the second plane had hit, and we were told to evacuate.People gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the Sears Tower, transformed from a workplace to a target. We feared for our families and our country. We mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens. Back at my law office, I watched the images from New York: a plane vanishing into glass and steel; men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go; tall towers crumbling to dust. It seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud, blocking out the September sun.What we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats, we are no longer protected by our own power. And what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation.The history of America is one of tragedy turned into triumph. And so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free. An attack on Pearl Harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the Atlantic and Pacific. An Iron Curtain was punctured by democratic values, new institutions at home, and strong international partnerships abroad.After 9/11, our calling was to write a new chapter in the American story. To devise new strategies and build new alliances, to secure our homeland and safeguard our values, and to serve a just cause abroad. We were ready. Americans were united. Friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us. We had the might and moral-suasion that was the legacy of generations of Americans. The tide of history seemed poised to turn, once again, toward hope.But then everything changed.We did not finish the job against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy, or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists' base of support. We did not reaffirm our basic values, or secure our homeland.Instead, we got a color-coded politics of fear. Patriotism as the possession of one political party. The diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries. A rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st century's stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state. A deliberate strategy to misrepresent 9/11 to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11.And so, a little more than a year after that bright September day, I was in the streets of Chicago again, this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in Iraq. I did not oppose all wars, I said. I was a strong supporter of the war in Afghanistan. But I said I could not support \"a dumb war, a rash war\" in Iraq. I worried about a \" U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences\" in the heart of the Muslim world. I pleaded that we \"finish the fight with bin Ladin and al Qaeda.\"The political winds were blowing in a different direction. The President was determined to go to war. There was just one obstacle: the U.S. Congress. Nine days after I spoke, that obstacle was removed. Congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the President the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day. With that vote, Congress became co-author of a catastrophic war. And we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create, and no plan for how to get out.Because of a war in Iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11.According to the National Intelligence Estimate, the threat to our homeland from al Qaeda is \"persistent and evolving.\" Iraq is a training ground for terror, torn apart by civil war. Afghanistan is more violent than it has been since 2001. Al Qaeda has a sanctuary in Pakistan. Israel is besieged by emboldened enemies, talking openly of its destruction. Iran is now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the United States in the Middle East in a generation. Groups affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda operate worldwide. Six years after 9/11, we are again in the midst of a \"summer of threat,\" with bin Ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in the United States.What's more, in the dark halls of Abu Ghraib and the detention cells of Guantanamo, we have compromised our most precious values. What could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power. A tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us.It is time to turn the page. It is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11.Just because the President misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them. The terrorists are at war with us. The threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, but the threat is real. They distort Islam. They kill man, woman and child; Christian and Hindu, Jew and Muslim. They seek to create a repressive caliphate. To defeat this enemy, we must understand who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for.The President would have us believe that every bomb in Baghdad is part of al Qaeda's war against us, not an Iraqi civil war. He elevates al Qaeda in Iraq -- which didn't exist before our invasion -- and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits in Pakistan. He lumps together groups with very different goals: al Qaeda and Iran, Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents. He confuses our mission.And worse -- he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight. Bin Ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas. But they can provoke the reaction we've seen in Iraq: a misguided invasion of a Muslim country that sparks new insurgencies, ties down our military, busts our budgets, increases the pool of terrorist recruits, alienates America, gives democracy a bad name, and prompts the American people to question our engagement in the world.By refusing to end the war in Iraq, President Bush is giving the terrorists what they really want, and what the Congress voted to give them in 2002: a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.It is time to turn the page. When I am President, we will wage the war that has to be won, with a comprehensive strategy with five elements: getting out of Iraq and on to the right battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan; developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world's most deadly weapons; engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism; restoring our values; and securing a more resilient homeland.The first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in Iraq, and taking the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.I introduced a plan in January that would have already started bringing our troops out of Iraq, with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31, 2008. If the President continues to veto this plan, then ending this war will be my first priority when I take office.There is no military solution in Iraq. Only Iraq's leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of Iraq's civil war. We must apply pressure on them to act, and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence. And we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability.In ending the war, we must act with more wisdom than we started it. That is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al Qaeda within Iraq. But we must recognize that al Qaeda is not the primary source of violence in Iraq, and has little support -- not from Shia and Kurds who al Qaeda has targeted, or Sunni tribes hostile to foreigners. On the contrary, al Qaeda's appeal within Iraq is enhanced by our troop presence.Ending the war will help isolate al Qaeda and give Iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out. It will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to Afghanistan. Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need\u00e2\u0080\u0094and deserve. As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country.As President, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counter-terrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban. As we step up our commitment, our European friends must do the same, and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered NATO's efforts. We must also put more of an Afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the Afghan Army and Police, and including Afghan soldiers in U.S. and NATO operations.We must not, however, repeat the mistakes of Iraq. The solution in Afghanistan is not just military -- it is political and economic. As President, I would increase our non-military aid by $1 billion. These resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary Afghans, including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers. And we must seek better performance from the Afghan government, and support that performance through tough anti-corruption safeguards on aid, and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country.Above all, I will send a clear message: we will not repeat the mistake of the past, when we turned our back on Afghanistan following Soviet withdrawal. As 9/11 showed us, the security of Afghanistan and America is shared. And today, that security is most threatened by the al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwest Pakistan.Al Qaeda terrorists train, travel, and maintain global communications in this safe-haven. The Taliban pursues a hit and run strategy, striking in Afghanistan, then skulking across the border to safety.This is the wild frontier of our globalized world. There are wind-swept deserts and cave-dotted mountains. There are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map, and governments as forces that come and go. There are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience, and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence. It's a tough place.But that is no excuse. There must be no safe-haven for terrorists who threaten America. We cannot fail to act because action is hard.As President, I would make the hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Pakistan conditional, and I would make our conditions clear: Pakistan must make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.And Pakistan needs more than F-16s to combat extremism. As the Pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas, my Administration will increase America's commitment. We must help Pakistan invest in the provinces along the Afghan border, so that the extremists' program of hate is met with one of hope. And we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair -- our goal is not simply an ally in Pakistan, it is a democratic ally.Beyond Pakistan, there is a core of terrorists -- probably in the tens of thousands -- who have made their choice to attack America. So the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down, capture or kill terrorists around the world, and to deny them the world's most dangerous weapons.I will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to America. This requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the Army and Marine Corps's new counter-insurgency manual. I will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists. We need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same. This must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages, understand different cultures, and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies.To succeed, we must improve our civilian capacity. The finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. But it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions -- sometimes in dangerous places. As President, I will strengthen these civilian capacities, recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge. I will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts, and other civilians who can work alongside our military. We can't just say there is no military solution to these problems. We need to integrate all aspects of American might.One component of this integrated approach will be new Mobile Development Teams that bring together personnel from the State Department, the Pentagon, and USAID. These teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples' lives, and to turn the tide against extremism. Where people are most vulnerable, where the light of hope has grown dark, and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity -- that is where these teams will go.I will also strengthen our intelligence. This is about more than an organizational chart. We need leadership that forces our agencies to share information, and leadership that never -- ever -- twists the facts to support bad policies. But we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information, and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks.This cannot just be an American mission. Al Qaeda and its allies operate in nearly 100 countries. The United States cannot steal every secret, penetrate every cell, act on every tip, or track down every terrorist -- nor should we have to do this alone. This is not just about our security. It is about the common security of all the world.As President, I will create a Shared Security Partnership Program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands of Indonesia, to the sprawling cities of Africa. This program will provide $5 billion over three years for counter-terrorism cooperation with countries around the world, including information sharing, funding for training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and targeting terrorist financing. And this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics, because brutality breeds terror, it does not defeat it.We must also do more to safeguard the world's most dangerous weapons. We know al Qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon. We know they would not hesitate to use one. Yet there is still about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium, some of it poorly secured, at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries. There are still about 15,000 to 16,00 nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across 11 time zones in the former Soviet Union.That is why I worked in the Senate with Dick Lugar to pass a law that would help the United States and our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction. That is why I am introducing a bill with Chuck Hagel that seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And that is why, as President, I will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years. While we work to secure existing stockpiles, we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material.And I won't hesitate to use the power of American diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror. The lesson of the Bush years is that not talking does not work. Go down the list of countries we've ignored and see how successful that strategy has been. We haven't talked to Iran, and they continue to build their nuclear program. We haven't talked to Syria, and they continue support for terror. We tried not talking to North Korea, and they now have enough material for 6 to 8 more nuclear weapons.It's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action. It's time to turn the page on Washington's conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that Presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear.President Kennedy said it best: \"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\" Only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them. As President, I will work with our friend and allies, but I won't outsource our diplomacy in Tehran to the Europeans, or our diplomacy in Pyongyang to the Chinese. I will do the careful preparation needed, and let these countries know where America stands. They will no longer have the excuse of American intransigence. They will have our terms: no support for terror and no nuclear weapons.But America must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons, or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill. That is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism.When you travel to the world's trouble spots as a United States Senator, much of what you see is from a helicopter. So you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camp in Darfur, the flood near Djibouti, the bombed out block in Baghdad. You see thousands of desperate faces.Al Qaeda's new recruits come from Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world. And it makes you stop and wonder: when those faces look up at an American helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?We know where extremists thrive. In conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy. In weak states that cannot control their borders or territory, or meet the basic needs of their people. From Africa to central Asia to the Pacific Rim -- nearly 60 countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse. The extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate-filled websites.And we know what the extremists say about us. America is just an occupying Army in Muslim lands, the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at Abu Ghraib, the power behind the throne of a repressive leader. They say we are at war with Islam. That is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame -- blame America, blame progress, blame Jews. And often he offers something along with the hate. A sense of empowerment. Maybe an education at a madrasa, some charity for your family, some basic services in the neighborhood. And then: a mission and a gun.We know we are not who they say we are. America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil. We are not at war with Islam. America is a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people. The vast majority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims have no use for bin Ladin or his bankrupt ideas. But too often since 9/11, the extremists have defined us, not the other way around.When I am President, that will change. We will author our own story.We do need to stand for democracy. And I will. But democracy is about more than a ballot box. America must show -- through deeds as well as words -- that we stand with those who seek a better life. That child looking up at the helicopter must see America and feel hope.As President, I will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate. Freedom must mean freedom from fear, not the freedom of anarchy. I will never shrug my shoulders and say -- as Secretary Rumsfeld did -- \"Freedom is untidy.\" I will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems, honest police forces, and financial systems that are transparent and accountable. Freedom must also mean freedom from want, not freedom lost to an empty stomach. So I will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy.I will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to $50 billion by 2012. And I will support a $2 billion Global Education Fund to counter the radical madrasas -- often funded by money from within Saudi Arabia -- that have filled young minds with messages of hate. We must work for a world where every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy. And as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in Europe and Asia as well -- more support for our diplomacy, more support for multilateral peacekeeping, and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict.I will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my Administration, not a small group of political officials at the State Department explaining a misguided war. We will open \"America Houses\" in cities across the Islamic world, with Internet, libraries, English lessons, stories of America's Muslims and the strength they add to our country, and vocational programs. Through a new \" America's Voice Corps\" we will recruit, train, and send out into the field talented young Americans who can speak with -- and listen to -- the people who today hear about us only from our enemies.As President, I will lead this effort. In the first 100 days of my Administration, I will travel to a major Islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle. I will make clear that we are not at war with Islam, that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future, and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence. I will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter, and my message will be clear: \"You matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\"This brings me to the fourth step in my strategy: I will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over.Major General Paul Eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country. It included training the Iraqi Army. After Abu Ghraib, his senior Iraqi advisor came into his office and said: \"You have no idea how this will play out on the streets of Baghdad and the rest of the Arab world. How can this be?\" This was not the America he had looked up to.As the counter-insurgency manual reminds us, we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side. But because the Administration decided to take the low road, our troops have more enemies. Because the Administration cast aside international norms that reflect American values, we are less able to promote our values. When I am President, America will reject torture without exception. America is the country that stood against that kind of behavior, and we will do so again.I also will reject a legal framework that does not work. There has been only one conviction at Guantanamo. It was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism. The sentence was 9 months. There has not been one conviction of a terrorist act. I have faith in America's courts, and I have faith in our JAGs. As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Our Constitution and our Uniform Code of Military Justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists.This Administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand. I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.That means no more illegal wire-tapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are. And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists. The FISA court works. The separation of powers works. Our Constitution works. We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers, and that justice is not arbitrary.This Administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security. It is not. There are no short-cuts to protecting America, and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland.Too often this Administration's approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices, or to scare Americans without telling them what to be scared of, or what to do. A Department set up to make Americans feel safer didn't even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in New Orleans. That's not acceptable.My Administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk. I will establish a Quadrennial Review at the Department of Homeland Security -- just like at the Pentagon -- to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them. And I will develop a comprehensive National Infrastructure Protection Plan that draws on both local know-how and national priorities.We have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable. That means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants. Improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports. And making sure our energy sector -- our refineries and pipelines and power grids -- is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy.We also have to get past a top-down approach. Folks across America are the ones on the front lines. On 9/11, it was citizens -- empowered by their knowledge of the World Trade Center attacks -- who protected our government by heroically taking action on Flight 93 to keep it from reaching our nation's capital. When I have information that can empower Americans, I will share it with them.Information sharing with state and local governments must be a two-way street, because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together -- the tip from Afghanistan, and the cop who sees something suspicious on Michigan Avenue. I will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government. I will address the problem in our prisons, where the most disaffected and disconnected Americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al Qaeda and its ideological allies.And my Administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires, or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes. We've been through that on 9/11. We've been through it during Katrina. I will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when American lives are at stake.But this effort can't just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform. It can't just be about how we spend our time or our money.It's about the kind of country we are.We are in the early stages of a long struggle. Yet since 9/11, we've heard a lot about what America can't do or shouldn't do or won't even try. We can't vote against a misguided war in Iraq because that would make us look weak, or talk to other countries because that would be a reward. We can't reach out to the hundreds of millions of Muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us. We can't protect the homeland because there are too many targets, or secure our people while staying true to our values. We can't get past the America of Red and Blue, the politics of who's up and who's down.That is not the America that I know.The America I know is the last, best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter. It's the country that put a man on the moon; that defeated fascism and helped rebuild Europe. It's a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies, but rather by the power of our ideals, and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home.That's the America I know. We just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the American story. If we do, we can keep America safe while extending security and opportunity around the world. We can hold true to our values, and in doing so advance those values abroad. And we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be: the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny, and the light of hope to the world.To make this story reality, it's going to take Americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country. It's going to take the service of a new generation of young people. It's going to take facing tragedy head-on and turning it into the next generation's triumph. That is a challenge that I welcome. Because when we do make that change, we'll do more than win a war -- we'll live up to that calling to make America, and the world, safer, freer, and more hopeful than we found it.As prepared for delivery", "comment_3": "Mr. President.

The debate was moderated by Lester Holt of NBC News and came as polls both nationally and in swing states are increasingly tight.\n\nThe complete transcript of the debate is posted below. The Fix team has annotated it with context, analysis and other thoughts, using Genius.\n\nTo see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted words. If you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\n\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\n\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\n\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\n\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Good luck to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\n\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\n\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\n\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\n\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nCLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\n\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\n\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\n\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\n\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\n\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\n\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\n\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n\nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\n\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\n\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\n\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\n\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\n\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\n\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\n\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\n\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\n\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\n\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\n\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\n\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\n\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\n\nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\n\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.\n\nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\n\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\n\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\n\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\n\nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: I think science is real.\n\nTRUMP: I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\n\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\n\nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\n\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\n\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\n\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\n\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually...\n\nTRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.\n\nCLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\n\nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...\n\nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\n\nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\n\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\n\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly...\n\nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...\n\nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\n\nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nCLINTON: And I have done a lot...\n\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\n\nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\n\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...\n\nTRUMP: Not.\n\nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...\n\nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: ... before you even announced.\n\nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: Look, there are differences...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: There are...\n\nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it.\n\nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\n\nTRUMP: But you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...\n\nTRUMP: That's about all you've...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Folks, we're going to...\n\nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.\n\nHOLT: We're going to move to...\n\nCLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\n\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\n\nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\n\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\n\nWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\n\nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\n\nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...\n\nCLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.\n\nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.\n\nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...\n\nTRUMP: Facts.\n\nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...\n\nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\n\nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\n\nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...\n\nTRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\n\nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...\n\nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...\n\nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\n\nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...\n\nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\n\nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity...\n\nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\n\nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.\n\nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\n\nCLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.\n\nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.\n\nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.\n\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.\n\nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\n\nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\n\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\n\nTRUMP: Why not?\n\nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\n\nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\n\nHOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\n\nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it.\n\nCLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...\n\nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...\n\nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...\n\nTRUMP: Lester, how much?\n\nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\n\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\n\nCLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...\n\nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\n\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\n\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\n\nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\n\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\n\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\n\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\n\nHOLT: The IRS says an audit...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nHOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\n\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.\n\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\n\nHOLT: So it's negotiable?\n\nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...\n\nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\n\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\n\nCLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\n\nTRUMP: That makes me smart.\n\nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\n\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\n\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\n\nHOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\n\nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\n\nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\n\nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\n\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.\n\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\n\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\n\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\n\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.\n\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\n\nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n\nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\n\nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the other thing I think is important...\n\nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.\n\nCLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\n\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\n\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\n\nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\n\nCLINTON: Well, to...\n\nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too.\n\nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\n\nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\n\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\n\nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...\n\nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.\n\nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.\n\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\n\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\n\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\n\nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\n\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\n\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\n\nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\n\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\n\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\n\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\n\nCLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\n\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\n\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\n\nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\n\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.\n\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\n\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\n\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\n\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\n\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\n\nWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\n\nHOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\n\nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\n\nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\n\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\n\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\n\nBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\n\nTRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\n\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton...\n\nTRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Ugh.\n\nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\n\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\n\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\n\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\n\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\n\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\n\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\n\nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\n\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\n\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\n\nCLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.\n\nHOLT: Please.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\n\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\n\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\n\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\n\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\n\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\n\nCLINTON: No, I'm not.\n\nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.\n\nCLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\n\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\n\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\n\nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.\n\nHOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\n\nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\n\nThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...\n\nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I...\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\n\nTRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\n\nTRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\n\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\n\nHOLT: That was...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\n\nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\n\nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\n\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\n\nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\n\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\n\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\n\nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\n\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\n\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\n\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.\n\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\n\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\n\nTRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.\n\nBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\n\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\n\nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\n\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\n\nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\n\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired.\n\nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.\n\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\n\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.\n\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\n\nTRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.\n\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\n\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\n\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.\n\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\n\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\n\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\n\nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\n\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\n\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\n\nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\n\nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\n\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\n\nCLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\n\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\n\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\n\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\n\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\n\nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\n\nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond.\n\nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\n\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\n\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\n\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\n\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\n\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\n\nAnd they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\n\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...\n\nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered...\n\nTRUMP: No, wait a minute.\n\nCLINTON: We've covered this ground.\n\nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...\n\nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.\n\nHOLT: In 2002...\n\nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n\nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it...\n\nTRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...\n\nHOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\n\nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...\n\nTRUMP: The record does not show that.\n\nHOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...\n\nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than...\n\nTRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\n\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.\n\nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...\n\nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Whew, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\n\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\n\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\n\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\n\nTRUMP: That would not start a war.\n\nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...\n\nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us.\n\nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.\n\nTRUMP: It's lies.\n\nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\n\nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...\n\nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.\n\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\n\nHOLT: We need to move on.\n\nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\n\nHOLT: Our last...\n\nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\n\nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\n\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\n\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\n\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\n\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\n\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\n\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired.\n\nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.\n\nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\n\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\n\nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\n\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\n\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.\n\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is...\n\nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.\n\nHOLT: ... is expired.\n\nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...\n\nHOLT: We have just...\n\nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.\n\nHOLT: We have just a few final questions...\n\nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n\nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\"\n\nTRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\n\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.\n\nHOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\n\nHOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.\n\nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...\n\nTRUMP: I never said that.\n\nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\n\nTRUMP: I didn't say that.\n\nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.\n\nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...\n\nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\n\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...\n\nHOLT: Please very quickly.\n\nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.\n\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.\n\nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\n\nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question.\n\nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\n\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\n\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\n\nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?\n\nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\n\nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.\n\nA reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n", "comment_3": "\u201cNone of this by Trump @POTUS is normal\u201d: read the full transcript of Sen.

But, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\nSoldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They\u2019re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It\u2019s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\nWhy armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (\u201c\u2018This my property!\u2019 he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.\u201d) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that \u201cWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone\u201d?\n\nOlson added, \u201cthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\u201d\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\u201d\n\nBernick continued, \u201cfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\u201d\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \u201ctoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\u201d\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown\u2019s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.\n\nWitness Tension Between Police and Protestors in Ferguson, Mo.

He also directs the center\u2019s Washington, D.C., office.\n\nIf Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama\u2019s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.\n\nBut one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)\n\nRetirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it\u2019s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.\n\nOver the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.\n\nThe importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party\u2019s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.\n\nIn 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party\u2019s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.\n\nRepublicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics\u2019 Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.\n\nBut in all likelihood, the foundation for this year\u2019s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That\u2019s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.\n\nAn election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the purposes of this \u201cwhat if\u201d exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:\n\nWest Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito\u2019s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito\u2019s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle \u2013 she\u2019s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn\u2019t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive \u2013 but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we\u2019d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.\n\nMontana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh\u2019s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.", "comment_3": "Unless @GDouglasJones is one of the guys who nailed Jesus to the cross, if the Democrats somehow find a way to lose\u2026 https://t.co/CZbJ0Tt7pj", "target": "real", "comment_1": "If Democrats lose, blame these guys http://t.co/pWFy1v2OqE"}

{"split": "train", "comment_2": "[DKos] Obama's goal: Health care reform by end of year: Opening up today's White House Forum on Health Ref.. http://tinyurl.com/cjew8d", "text": "Well, let me be clear: The same soaring costs that are straining families' budgets are sinking our businesses and eating up our government's budget, too. Too many small businesses can't insure their employees. Major American corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. And companies of all sizes are shipping their jobs overseas or shutting their doors for good.\n\nMedicare costs are consuming our federal budget; I don't have to tell members of Congress this. Medicaid is overwhelming our state budgets; I don't need to tell governors and state legislatures that.\n\nAt the fiscal summit that we held here last week, the one thing on which everyone agreed was that the greatest threat to America's fiscal health is not Social Security, though that's a significant challenge; it's not the investments that we've made to rescue our economy during this crisis. By a wide margin, the biggest threat to our nation's balance sheet is the skyrocketing cost of health care. It's not even close.\n\nThat's why we cannot delay this discussion any longer. That's why today's forum is so important -- because health care reform is no longer just a moral imperative, it's a fiscal imperative. If we want to create jobs and rebuild our economy and get our federal budget under control, then we have to address the crushing cost of health care this year, in this administration. Making investments in reform now, investments that will dramatically lower costs, won't add to our budget deficits in the long term -- rather, it is one of the best ways -- in fact maybe the only way -- to reduce those long-term costs.\n\nNow, I know people are skeptical about whether Washington can bring about this change. Our inability to reform health care in the past is just one example of how special interests have had their way, and the public interest has fallen by the wayside. And I know people are afraid we'll draw the same old lines in the sand and give in to the same entrenched interests and arrive back at the same stalemate that we've been stuck in for decades.\n\nBut I am here today and I believe you are here today because this time is different. This time, the call for reform is coming from the bottom up and from all across the spectrum -- from doctors, from nurses, from patients; from unions, from businesses; from hospitals, health care providers, community groups. It's coming from mayors and governors and legislatures, Democrats, Republicans -- all who are racing ahead of Washington to pass bold health care initiatives on their own. This time, there is no debate about whether all Americans should have quality, affordable health care -- the only question is, how?\n\nAnd the purpose of this forum is to start answering that question -- to determine how we lower costs for everyone, improve quality for everyone, and expand coverage to all Americans. And our goal will be to enact comprehensive health care reform by the end of this year. That is our commitment. That is our goal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nNow, in the past month alone, we've done a lot more to advance that goal than we've done in the past decade. We've provided and protected coverage for 11 million children from working families, and for 7 million Americans who've lost their jobs in this downturn. We've made the largest investment in history in preventive care; invested in electronic medical records that will save money, ensure privacy, and save lives; we've launched a new effort to find a cure for cancer in our time. We've also set aside in our budget a health care reserve fund to finance comprehensive reform. I know that more will be required, but this is a significant down payment that's fully paid for, does not add one penny to our deficit. And I look forward to working with Congress and the American people to get this budget passed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, as we work to determine the details of health care reform, we won't always see eye to eye. We may disagree -- and disagree strongly -- about particular measures. But we know that there are plenty of areas of agreement, as well, and that should serve as the starting points for our work.\n\nWe can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention. We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive.\n\nAnd finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible. And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today. In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town. (Laughter.) That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views. As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended. I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me.\n\nIn this effort, every voice has to be heard. Every idea must be considered. Every option must be on the table. There should be no sacred cows. Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect. If that's the measure, we will never get anything done. But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential. And I don't think anybody would argue that we are on a sustainable path when it comes to health care.\n\nFinally, I want to be very clear at the outset that while everyone has a right to take part in this discussion, nobody has the right to take it over and dominate. The status quo is the one option that's not on the table, and those who seek to block any reform at all -- any reform at any costs will not prevail this time around.\n\nI didn't come here to Washington to work for those interests. I came here to work for the American people -- the folks I met on the campaign trail, the people I hear from every single day in the White House. Folks who are working hard, making all the right decisions, but still face choices that no one in this country should have to make: how long to put off that doctor's appointment; whether to fill that prescription; when to give up and head to the emergency room because there are no other options.\n\nI've read some of the many letters they've sent asking me for help. And they're usually not asking for much. I don't get letters where people are just asking for a free ride, for a handout. Most of them are embarrassed about their situation; they would rather not have to ask for help. They start, usually, by saying that they've never written a letter like this before. Some end by apologizing -- saying they've written to me because they have nowhere else to turn; asking me not to forget about them, not to forget about their families.\n\nBut there are a lot of people out there who are desperate. There's a lot of desperation out there. Today I want them, and people like them across this country, to know that I have not forgotten them. We have not forgotten them. They are why we're here today -- to start delivering the change they demanded at the polls in November; that they have continued to demand since the election. And if we're successful, if we can pass comprehensive reform, these folks will see their costs come down, they'll get the care they need, and we'll help our businesses create jobs again so our economy can grow.\n\nSo it's not going to be easy. And there are going to be false starts and setbacks and mistakes along the way. But I'm confident if we come together and work together, we will finally achieve what generations of Americans have fought for and fulfill the promise of health care in our time. And what a remarkable achievement that would be -- something that Democrats and Republicans, business and labor, consumer groups and providers, all of us could share extraordinary pride in finally dealing with something that has been vexing us for so long.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo let's get to work.

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are \u201cnot a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high\u2026. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions.

Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2013\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Kathleen Sebelius\n\nSecretary\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\n200 Independence Ave., SW\n\nWashington, DC 20201\n\n\n\nRE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates\n\n\n\nDear Secretary Sebelius,\n\n\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.\n\n\n\nAs you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.\n\n\n\nAs of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida\u2019s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS\u2019s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.\n\n\n\nIndeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.\n\n\n\nOver 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida\u2019s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.\n\n\n\nWhile other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers \u2013 since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # e\n\nRelated News House Passes Deutch Amendment to Promote Awareness of Mental Health and Addiction Parity Laws\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview rr\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview Deutch, Castor, FL Democrats Ask Gov.

But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.\n\nTrump said, \"China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.\"\n\nWith the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nWhen we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea\u2019s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of \"total control.\"\n\n\"China does not \u2018control\u2019 North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,\" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.\n\nRobert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.\n\n\"It\u2019s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,\" Ross said. \"Do the parents have total control? Perhaps \u2013 they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive \u2013 driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.\"\n\nChina\u2019s leverage over North Korea\n\nThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.\n\nNorth Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea\u2019s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.\n\n\"North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,\" Haggard told PolitiFact.\n\nWhy \u2018total control\u2019 is an exaggeration\n\nYet while China\u2019s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn\u2019t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump\u2019s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\n\nFor starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.\n\n\"China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,\" Haggard said.\n\nIt also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn\u2019t exactly listen to outsiders.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,\" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. \"This is hardly control.\"\n\nNot only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country\u2019s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.\n\n\"North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,\" Revere said. \"This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.\"\n\nIndeed, despite North Korea\u2019s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, \"it is not clear that the leadership cares,\" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. \"For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea\u2019s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China\u2019s situation.\n\nThis was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.\n\n\"China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,\" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.\"\n\nThat does not sound like a country in \"total control\" of another.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim \"suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,\" Revere said. \"It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nHe has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea\u2019s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump\u2019s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government\u2019s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching \"total control\" over North Korea.\n\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "comment_3": "Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea | PolitiFact #china you're #fired ? https://t.co/uWOPNzn3XA", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea https://t.co/fPhr1EQkUb via @PolitiFact"}

The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable, and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office, he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan. John McCain Is Calling For A New Strategy In Afghanistan That Applies The Tried And True Principles Of Counter-Insurgency Used In The Iraq Surge. As President, John McCain will turn around the war in Afghanistan with a comprehensive strategy for victory. In Afghanistan, we need an integrated, nationwide civil-military campaign that is focused on providing security for the population. John McCain's Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan: John McCain Will Work With Our Allies To Ensure Unity Of Command In Afghanistan. One of the reasons there is no comprehensive campaign plan for Afghanistan is because there is no unity of command. Today, there are no less than three different American military combatant commands operating in Afghanistan, as well as NATO. The top commander in Afghanistan needs to be just that: the supreme commander of all coalition forces operating a successful counter-insurgency strategy that integrates all instructs of our national power. John McCain Will Appoint An Afghanistan Czar To Ensure Commanders Have What They Need To Win. Unity of command is a principle lacking in Washington. Too often, even as our soldiers and diplomats cooperate in the field, their superiors back home have been squabbling. Last year, the Administration took a step in the right direction and appointed a war czar. But the situation in Afghanistan demands a separate Czar based in the White House, reporting directly to the President and dedicated to the sole mission of ensuring we bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful end. John McCain Supports Sending At Least Three Additional Brigades To Afghanistan. Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available, and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them. John McCain Will Double The Size Of The Afghan Military. The Afghan army is already a great success story: a multiethnic, battle-tested fighting force. Yet, it's too small, with a projected strength of only 80,000 troops. We need to at least double the size of the Afghan army to 160,000 troops. To pay for this increase, the international community should share the costs. The United States and our allies should establish an international trust fund to provide long-term financing for the Afghan army. John McCain Will Increase Our Non-Military Assistance To The Afghan Government. Through a multi-front plan, we will increase assistance to the Afghan government to strengthen its institutions, the rule of law, and the economy. Essential to success of the mission in Afghanistan is getting control of narcotics trafficking. Alternative crops must be able to get to market and traffickers must be arrested and prosecuted by enhanced Special Courts. We should agree on specific governance and development benchmarks with the Afghan government and then work with them closely to ensure they are met. John McCain Will Enhance Our Regional Diplomatic Efforts By Appointing A Special Presidential Envoy. The violence in Afghanistan has many causes, but chief among them is the fact that the country is treated by some regional powers as a chessboard to pursue their own ambitions. John McCain will appoint a special presidential envoy to address disputes between Afghanistan and its neighbors. Our goal must be to turn Afghanistan from a theater for regional rivalries into a commons for regional cooperation. As Part Of This Regional Strategy, John McCain Will Put Special Focus On Pakistan. We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there. We must also empower the new civilian government of Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development, health, and education. ###\n\n", "comment_3": "Though very uncomfortable about the part in the speech reasoning that Muslims should be protected because they help\u2026 https://t.co/ANdcEaWHma", "target": "real", "comment_1": "#thewarisreal #thethreatisreal \nWe need #wisdom and #strategies to win the war on America.

But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine \u2014 most likely by a lot,\" Buffett wrote. \"To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\n\n\nBuffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nBefore we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.\n\n\n\nIncome taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:\n\n\u2022 the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;\n\n\u2022 the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.\n\nKeep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.\n\nPayroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.\n\nHead hurt yet? Ours, too.\n\nTaxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.\n\nSome hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as \"carried interest\" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.\n\nGetting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,\" while middle class taxpayers \"fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\"\n\nHe's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nBuffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.\n\nOne final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.\n\nSo when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.", "comment_3": "PolitiFact | Warren Buffett says the super-rich pay lower tax rates than others http://t.co/Zf8njGA1 via @politifact", "target": "real", "comment_1": "GOD BLESS WARREN BUFFETT  Warren Buffett says the super-rich pay lower tax rates than others http://t.co/GEJxOGMe via @politifact"}

Did you have a moment of wondering if you were really ready for this?\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: Not last night, but, I mean, if you reach the point where you're wondering it the night before you announce, then you probably shouldn't run. I think anyone who's thinking about the highest office in the most powerful nation on earth has to spend some time analyzing whether they're prepared for the job. And look, I think the job is perhaps the most difficult job in politics anywhere in the world. You're the leader of the most powerful military on the planet. You make decisions that have global implications. And it's happening at a time when the country's going through an extraordinary economic transformation that is leaving many people insecure.

And clearly, as you see the history of the presidency, people who go into that office grow, the office helps you grow as well as you go through it and that's, having the ability to learn is a big part of the office as well. But I'm certainly capable from day 1. I'm very confident that I have the capability from day no. 1 to lead this country.\n\nAre you also affirming that you are not giving up your \u2014 are you also affirming that you are not running for Senate?\n\nI am not. And the reason I think strongly about that is, if you've decided that you want to serve this country as its president, that's what you should be running for. And I find myself in a situation where my Senate seat comes up for re-election at the exact same time as the presidency. And by Florida law, you can't run for both, anyway. But to even be thinking about a Plan B in case this doesn't work, I think diminishes your ability to succeed on the campaign because your mind will always be on, if this doesn't work, then I can do something else. And the truth is that, you know, I don't want to be in politics my entire life. And I'm prepared to serve this country now in its highest office and I'm excited about this opportunity.\n\nYou'll be in a crowded Republican field. How do you expect to distinguish yourself from your opponents on the Republican side?\n\nWell, I expect that I'm going to go out and tell people my vision for the future of this country. I'm going to be very specific and detailed about our plans and how we're going to get there. In fact, I've done that already. We have a very detailed policy position that we've outlined on numerous issues over the last two years, culminating in my book that just came out earlier this year, American Dreams. And I think from that, voters are going to analyze the different position of the candidates, their capabilities, their history, but more importantly their view of the future and their plans to get us there and I'm very confident that that will lead to success.\n\nIs there a sentence that people can have in their heads? Marco Rubio is different from the others because...\n\nHe has the clear view of how the 21st century can also be an American century.\n\nWe're in a moment where you have put out plans proposing to reshape the way the federal government deals with federal assistance to the poor.\n\nYes.\n\nWe're in a moment where Jeb Bush, who may also run, has a superPAC called Right to Rise. And this week, of course, Hillary Clinton declared her campaign for the presidency talking about helping everyday people. What's going on there?\n\nWell, that's a good thing for our country because equality of opportunity has always defined us as a people and as a nation. And the fact that there are millions of people now in America that are starting to have significant doubts about whether we're still that kind of country should be deeply concerning to us. Our identity is at stake. Every country in the world has rich people. What makes America different is, we've had millions and millions of people who through hard work and perseverance are able to achieve happiness and upward mobility. And the fact that that's in danger and in question is deeply concerning, and should be. It threatens our identity. So I'm glad that people are talking about it. Ultimately, talking about it won't be enough. You have to have plans that work to help us address it. And for me it begins by embracing and acknowledging the reality that we are living through a massive transformation into this post-industrial 21st century economy that is both disruptive but also exciting. It comes not just with challenges, but also with opportunities. But we can only embrace those opportunities if we move forward on thinking about the changes we're going to have to make in order to fully enter the 21st century.\n\nWhat's one way that your approach would be different from Jeb Bush's or Hillary Clinton's?\n\nWell, as far as the Republican field is concerned, there will be plenty of time for comparison shopping. The truth is, for voters, the truth is that at this moment most of my opponents in the field beyond talking about upward mobility have not clearly outlined what they would do. We have a clear policy outline on each of these issues that people can read about. And if, you know, all of my opponents and other candidates in the Republican field choose to adopt some of those ideas, I'll consider that a victory as well as flattery. But on the Democratic side, I think, you know, Hillary Clinton is someone who's deeply wedded to the institutions of the 20th century. Her plans are to spend more money on the existing higher education system. That system doesn't work any more. It doesn't work any more because we don't graduate enough young people from high school ready to work. We need to do more of that \u2014 ready to work in trades as mechanics, airplane technicians and plumbers and engineers. These are good \u2014 welders. These are good 21st century jobs and we are capable of teaching people how to do that so at 18, 19 years of age, they can be employed. We also need to have more flexible, more flexibility in higher education for working Americans who can't afford to drop everything and go to school full-time for four years. We need to have programs that allow someone who works full time to learn at their own pace, on their own time, so that a receptionist can become a paralegal, so that the home-health aide making $10 an hour can become a dental hygienist making $55,000 a year. And then we have to have more quality measures in higher education. For example, before you take out a student loan--\n\nMhmm\n\nI have a bill that says every student, before you take out a student loan, needs to be told how much you can expect to make when you graduate from that school with the degree you're pursuing so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it's worth it to borrow a bunch of money for that degree.\n\nA Florida political reporter noticed that you spent a plane ride sitting beside Jeb Bush, more than two hours, coming back from an NRA convention. Did you guys talk about the presidential campaign at all?\n\nNot in great detail. Jeb and I are friends, we'll always be friends. And I have tremendous admiration for him as a person, what he did as governor, and personal affection. And that's not going to change. I don't view, I'm not running against Jeb Bush and I'm not running against anybody in this field. I'm running because I strongly believe that I have something to offer this country that no one else in the field does at this moment in our history. And I'm going to go out there and do the best job that I can and \u2014 but, I mean, that's not going to impact our relationship in any way that's going to change how we feel about one another and it was great to see him and spend quality time just talking about good times and everything going on ...\n\nYou didn't talk politics very much at all?\n\n... and everything in between. Sure, I mean we had observations about \u2014 we joked with a lot of the passengers who saw us sitting next to each other and we took some pictures with people and we told them, we warned them how historic a picture like that may be one day. And, um, but you know, we talked about the Masters, we talked about the Paleo diet, we talked about the Miami Dolphins. I mean it, we talked about, reminisced about old war stories from our time in the legislature, when I was in the legislature and he was governor. It was just a host of things.\n\nSooner or later if you go forward and he goes forward, there's going to be a moment where you're going to have to say, \"Here's why it should be me and not him.\"\n\nI don't know. I mean, I think this year's going to be quite different in that regard. We have a quality field of candidates who are going to be well financed and experienced, who are going to be running. And I think that'll change the nature of the race. There'll certainly be moments when others will try to draw distinctions. But in my mind, I'm going to talk about who I am and what I want to do. And I'll let voters make the decision about who they think is best capable at this moment of leading our country.\n\nYou scheduled an announcement at Miami's Freedom Tower, which has historic significance because Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's regime in the 60s and 70s received federal aid there. This brings to mind that you have strongly criticized President Obama's restoration of relations with Cuba. If you're elected, would you reverse that policy?\n\nAbsolutely, and I think the reason why is because I'm interested in, my interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy. I think the Cuban people, they are free, have the right to choose any economic model they want to follow. I don't believe these changes will actually further democracy. In fact, I think they will make it harder to achieve. The goal of the Castro regime is to create the impression and the reality that their form of government is a legitimate form of government and set it in concrete. They know they have a generational challenge. Most of their top leaders are in their 80s. The actuarial tables tell you they don't have much longer. And they want to leave in place global recognition for this form of government so that it can continue in perpetuity. And that means the Cuban people will never have the chance to experience what the people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti have, what the people in Mexico have, what the people in Peru have, what the people in Colombia have, which is free and fair elections. And that's all I want for the people in Cuba. And I think U.S. policy towards Cuba is a major leverage point that we can use to help the Cuban people achieve freedom for themselves.\n\nBut help me think through this. The president made this announcement, they're working on getting an embassy going at some point in the future. He went to Summit of the Americas where other countries in Latin America very much welcomed the restoration of relations. You're saying that if you're elected, you would close that embassy, you would break diplomatic ties, you would go back to the way things were?\n\nWe have an interest section in Cuba and it will continue to operate, but an embassy, I'm not, I don't believe this country should be diplomatically recognizing a nation of the nature of Cuba. Obviously there are other dictatorships in the world that we have relations with by geopolitical reality. You know, China's the largest country in the world, the second largest economy, the second largest military force. There are geopolitical realities there. Cuba is a brutal, tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from the shore of our country. It is a nation that helps North Korea evade U.N. weapon sanctions. It is a country that harbors fugitives from American justice, including Medicare fraudsters and someone who killed a police officer in the United States. And I just think that we should have continued with the policy and perhaps looked for new ways of \u2014 continue with the policy of not recognizing that regime and not allowing them access to economic growth that would allow them to perpetuate themselves in power, and continue to search for ways to provide the Cuban people with more information about the reality of the world so they would be empowered to eventually create for themselves a democratic society.\n\nYou've also said that you would reverse the president's deal with Iran, assuming that that is finalized. You said you would absolutely do that. What would that look like on day one?\n\nWell, I would not adhere \u2014 well, we have to understand the deal, basically, can be what it is on paper. What the president is banking on is that he's going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions on Iran, the economic sanctions that now exist. And we would simply re-impose the sanctions. And I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable. The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things. This issue of them asking for immediate relief of sanctions the minute the deal is signed is going to be a deal breaker. I hope it would be a deal break for this administration. And at the end of the day, we need to recognize that what Iran is trying to do here, and this is clear to anyone who has inside knowledge into this or has followed it closely, Iran is trying to maintain all the infrastructure they need to be nuclear capable without agreeing to any irreversible concessions. And that seems to be what they have achieved, if in fact this moves forward. So in my mind, we would just reinstitute the sanctions.\n\nBut I'm just thinking this through. The deal is made. It's made not just with the United States, but with the European allies. Would you move forward with re-imposing sanctions even if the Europeans don't go along with it?\n\nYes, it wouldn't be as effective, obviously. We would, ultimately, I think, the Europeans are going to have a test anyway because the Iranians are going to violate the sanctions at some point. They're going to evade it either by trying to take advantage of loopholes in the deal, or they'll just flat out evade it because they've always had a secret component to their, to their program. And at that point, they're going to have a huge test on their hands, which is, are they willing to live by the agreement that they even signed on to? But from the United States' perspective, while we want our allies to join us in this endeavor, and certainly sanctions against Iran would be more effective were they in conjunction with our allies around the world, we have to look out for our own national security concerns. And in my mind, if the president wanted this to be a permanent deal that survived his presidency, he would have brought it to Congress.\n\nI'm just thinking through further, though, as part of this deal, assuming it's finalized, the Iranians get rid of a vast amount of enriched uranium, almost all they have. They limit the amount of enrichment that they will have. They limit the number of centrifuges they will operate and they will allow inspections for decades, actually. So you would say, all that, forget about it, it's done.\n\nThey would retain all the infrastructure, first of all, they ...\n\nThey retain infrastructure, sure.\n\nThey retain not only just infrastructure, they retain centrifuges, too. They may not be spinning them, but they will retain them in their possession. They continue to develop their long range missile capabilities, which are unstopped. There's no prohibition on them acquiring a weapon design as they probably, may even already have. They continue to sponsor terrorism all over the world. In fact, now they'll have more funding to pay for it, in places they already control, places like Beirut. They're increasingly active in Yemen. Their hand and their role's clear in Bahrain and in a growing number of places around the world. And they continue to be run by a radical Shia cleric who has apocalyptic views of the future and of their role in it. So none of these things change. Their infrastructure will remain in place and at some point, they could follow the North Korean model very easily, which is they can cook up an excuse for why they need to have a weapon program and move forward on it.\n\nIs war inevitable then?\n\nI hope not. My hope is that we can delay a program long enough and you would hope that there would be some sort of change in leadership in Iran that would at least allow them to decide that they would rather have an economy than have a weapon. You can't guarantee it. But at the end of the day no one wants war, but I actually think that this deal could advance the prospects of war. I think this deal and the fact that Iran will retain nuclear infrastructure increases the likelihood that one of their neighbors may take action against them, whether it's Israel or the Saudis or someone else. It also increases the likelihood now, that Iran becomes even more aggressive in its proxy wars that it's conducting all over the world. It also increases the likelihood that they'll increase their conventional capabilities threatening our U.S. presence in the region. And ultimately I think it almost guarantees an arms race in the region, because the Saudis have made very clear, and others, the Egyptians as well, that whatever Iran has, they'll get as well. So if Iran is allowed to enrich to a certain level, they will begin doing the same, requiring a capability to do the same.\n\nLet me ask about a domestic issue. In recent weeks, the state of Indiana passed a Religious Freedom law, which was interpreted by many as discrimination, by others, as protection for people who don't want to take part in gay marriage. You defended the law and spoke about the hypothetical example of a florist who was asked to participate in a gay marriage and wanted to refuse. You said that person should have the right to follow their religious beliefs. Indiana, though, has since changed the law. Do you still support that concept?\n\nWell, to be fair, I haven't read the change in detail to give you an opinion on it specifically, but I'll tell you where I stand. I don't believe you can discriminate against people. So I don't believe it's right for a florist to say, I'm not going to provide you flowers because you're gay. I think there's a difference between not providing services to a person because of their identity, who they are or who they love, and saying, I'm not going to participate in an event, a same-sex wedding, because that violates my religious beliefs. There's a distinction between those two things. So, certainly, you can't not \u2014 it's immoral and wrong to say, I'm not going to allow someone who's gay or lesbian to use my restaurant, stay in my hotel, or provide photography service to them because they're gay. The difference here is, we're not talking about discriminating against a person because of who they are, we're talking about someone who's saying \u2014 what I'm talking about, anyway, is someone who's saying, I just don't want to participate as a vendor for an event, a specific event that violates the tenets of my faith.\n\nWhat if two gay people get married and then they go that night to a hotel. Can the hotelkeeper refuse service to them?\n\nThat's not part of an event. Again, I mean, that's, there's a difference between saying, we're not going to allow you to stay in our hotel, common lodging establishment where people have a right to shelter, food, medical care, and saying we're not going to, what we're not going to do is provide services to an event, to an actual event, which is the wedding itself. And I think that's the distinction point that people have been pointing to, and, because mainstream Christianity teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman. People feel very strongly about that. And to ask someone to individually provide services to something of that nature, I think violates their religious liberty.\n\nThere's a big question lurking here, which is that most Americans, according to surveys, now support gay marriage. A large minority of Americans still oppose gay marriage. The question is, that people seem to be wrestling with, is, what ground do opponents of gay marriage have left to stand on? What ground should they have to stand on?\n\nFirst of all, if the majority of Americans support gay marriage, then you'll see it reflected in changes in state law, which has always regulated marriage. And so at the end of the day, if a majority of people in any given state in this country petition their legislature to change the definition of marriage to include the marriage of two people of the same sex, that'll be the law of the land. And that is what it is. Separate from that, there's a constitutional protection of religious liberty that allows people to live by the tenets of their faith both in their public and in private life. That doesn't mean that you're allowed to go in and disrupt a gay wedding. But by the same token, it doesn't mean that someone's allowed to come to you and force you to be a participant in a ceremony that violates the tenets of your faith. And to be honest, in the real world, 99.9% of the time, a same-sex couple doesn't want a florist or a photographer at their wedding that doesn't agree with the choice that they've made. So we're really talking about an issue that in large part is really not going to manifest itself in daily life, but in the instances that it does, there are individuals that don't want to be compelled by force of law to participate in an event that puts them in the position of violating their religious faith. There's a difference between that and discriminating against an individual because of who they are.\n\nAre there are other specific situations on your mind where you feel that people who are opposed to gay marriage would need some kind of protection from, from it?\n\nWell, I mean, that's the one that's in the news today. Again, I don't, we can always sit here and engage in hypotheticals, this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, I mean, that's the one that's emerged because there's real cases behind people being fined for not providing services to a, to a ceremony as opposed to individuals.\n\nWhen we spoke last year, we talked about immigration, an issue on which you worked for a time on an immigration reform bill. You said, first, the reason to do that is not political, it's substantive. But, second, that there would be a political effect. That if the Republican Party deals with immigration, it would then have an opportunity to talk with Latino voters about other issues. And, of course, this is a voter group where Republicans have done very poorly in recent elections. Immigration hasn't been dealt with. What are the likely consequences for the Republican party in 2016?\n\nWell, again, every candidate has a different position on where they stand on the issue. From my perspective, I continue to believe it's an issue we need to address. The only point I've made is that I think the lessons of the last couple of years, for me, is that we're not going to be able to deal with it in one big piece of legislation. I still think we need to do immigration reform. I just don't think you can do it in a comprehensive, massive piece of legislation, given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government. I honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the American people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control \u2014 that if we legalize 12 million people, they won't be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally. And I honestly believe, given my experiences on this issue now, that if we did that, the American people and the majority of Republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and, and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally.\n\nBut we're in a circumstance, granted there's still time, but we're in a circumstance where it doesn't look like immigration legislation is going to get through Congress before 2016. What does that mean for your party?\n\nAnd I think, I think it's nearly \u2013 well, I just outlined to you what I think the key is to moving forward. And I think that's impossible as long as Barack Obama's president now, because on two instances, particularly very recently, last year, he issued an executive order ordering federal agencies not to enforce immigration law. So if I'm telling you that the key to moving forward is the enforcement of immigration law, then that says the notion that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, and you have a president that's ordering agencies not to enforce immigration law, our ability to convince people, no matter what we pass, that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, as long as Barack Obama's president, is nil.\n\nHow do you keep from getting hammered on that in a general election where the Hispanic vote may be very important?\n\nWell, I don't know about the others, but I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done. She's given speeches on it, but she's never done anything on it. So I have a record of trying to do something on it. It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration and I warned about that throughout that process, as well, that I didn't think we were doing enough to give that bill a chance of moving forward in the House.\n\nDoes your biography help?\n\nI think biography's part of all of our lives, all of our candidacies, because it certainly influences how you view the country and how you view issues. I have a personal attachment to the working class because it's where I come from, it's still the neighborhood I live in, it's the people my children go to school with, it's the community that I'm involved in. And, but I also happen to think it's the identity of our country. And every candidate, you know, will bring to bear their experiences in life and how it's guided them and influenced their thinking, but from my perspective, I think it matters simply because it informs me on my policy decisions.\n\nThere's a big question here, also, because the Republican party, as many people have noted, faces a demographic challenge that gets a little worse with every election cycle. Growing groups in society, such as Latinos and others, are voting increasingly Democratic, and Republican voter groups, particularly older white voters, are getting smaller. What's the Republican Party need to do about that?\n\nWell, at the end, I don't think people go to the ballot box and say, I'm a Latino, therefore I'm voting Democrat. I think they bring with them their hopes and fears about the future, and they vote for whoever they think best understands them. And the challenge the Republican Party has had is unfairly, but it's the reality, they've been portrayed as a party that doesn't care about people who are trying to make it. A disproportionate number of people who are trying to make it, who are working class, who are out there working for a living at $18 an hour, $15 an hour, happen to also be people from minority communities. And if you think someone doesn't care or understand people like you, no matter what your policies are, it's going to be difficult to get them to listen to you, much less vote for you. And so I hope the Republican Party can become the champion of the working class because I think our policy proposals of limited government and free enterprise are better for the people who are trying to make it than big government is. The fact is that big government helps the people who have made it. If you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, you'll benefit. And so that's why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.\n\nSo you're beginning this gigantic game of Survivor with who knows how many other candidates. You're smiling as I say that. With who knows how many other candidates, what will determine who survives ultimately and how will you make sure it's you?\n\nWell, there are basics about any campaign. Obviously you'll have to put time into it, you'll have to be able to raise sufficient funds to communicate your message. And on a daily basis, you have to make sure you do the best you can to help convince people in a crowded field that you're the best person at this time for the job that you seek. But beyond it, I really think the key is, who can inspire our country into believing that the future doesn't have to be worse than our past, that the 21st century can be better than the 20th. And then once you've inspired them to believe that, showing them how we can accomplish it. And I feel very confident in our ability to do it and I think that's why we're going to win.\n\nShould I think of this as an insurgent campaign, because you don't have the resources of Jeb Bush, particularly?\n\nWell, I think our resources will be sufficient to do the job we're trying to do. At the end of the day, this is not a fundraising competition in and of itself. You also have to have a message and a messenger and a policy outline that proves to people that, that your campaign is better for them than what someone else is offering. But I'm certainly not the frontrunner and \u2014 but that's O.K. The election isn't tomorrow.\n\nWhat are you doing to make sure you don't run out of money?\n\n(Laughs) We're going to, we, we're trying to raise as much money as we can and that's important. As long as the media outlets keep charging us for advertising, we'll have to keep raising money.\n\nSenator Rubio, thanks very much.\n\nThank you.", "comment_3": "Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Sen.

{"split": "train", "comment_2": "Transcript: Obama's prime-time press briefing http://bit.ly/LCQe", "text": "And that is why the single most important part of this Economic Recoveryand Reinvestment Plan is the fact that it will save or create up to 4million jobs, because that's what America needs most right now.\n\nIt is absolutely true that we can't depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth. That is and must be the roleof the private sector. But at this particular moment, with theprivate sector so weakened by this recession, the federal government isthe only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy backinto life. It is only government that can break the vicious cyclewhere lost jobs lead to people spending less money, which leads to evenmore layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the planthat's moving through Congress is designed todo.\n\nWhen passed, this plan will ensure thatAmericans who'velost their jobs through no fault of their own can receivegreater unemployment benefits and continue their health carecoverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are strugglingto pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth ofbadly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. Thesesteps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who aremost likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and getour economymoving.\n\nBut as we've learned very clearly andconclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all of our economicproblems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiestfew Americans.\n\nWe have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it'sonly helped lead us to the crisis we face rightnow.\n\nAnd that's why we have come together,around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for the middle class withdirect investment in areas like health care, energy, educationand infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, create new jobsand new businesses and help our economy grow again, now and in thefuture.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the jobs createdby this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to be make-work jobsbut jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobsrebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our dangerouslydeficient dams and levees, so that we don't face anotherKatrina.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey'll be jobs building the wind turbinesand solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower our dependence on foreign oiland modernizing our costly health care system that will save usbillions of dollars and countlesslives.\n\nThey'll be jobs creating the 21st-centuryclassrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children across America. And they'llbe the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide states with somerelief.\n\nNow after many weeks of debate and discussion, the planthat ultimately emerges from Congress must be big enough and bold enoughto meet the size of the economic challenges that we face rightnow. It's a plan that is already supported by businesses representingalmost every industry in America, by both the Chamber of Commerce andthe AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from bothDemocrats and Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented levelof transparency and accountability, so that every American will beable to go online and see where and how we're spending everydime.\n\nWhat it does not contain, however, is asingle pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped of the projects membersof both parties found mostobjectionable.\n\nNow despite all of this, the plan's notperfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this plan will workexactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that afailure to act will only deepen this crisis, as well as the pain feltby millions ofAmericans.\n\nMy administration inherited a deficit ofover $1 trillion,but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergencysince the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will resultin ever -- even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence.\n\nThose are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as I hold this office, Iwill do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and putthis country back towork.\n\nI want to thank the members of Congresswho've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also want to urge all membersof Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolvetheir differences and pass thisplan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe find ourselves in a rare moment wherethe citizens of our country and all countries are watching and waiting for us tolead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, butone that we must accept for the future of our children andour grandchildren.\n\nThe strongest democracies flourish fromfrequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of every background andbelief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of agreater purpose. That's the test facing the United States of Americain this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders and citizensto stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and monthsahead.\n\nAfter a day of speaking with and listeningto the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nation home, I have full faithand confidence that we can do it.\n\nBut we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead.\n\nAnd with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let mego to Jennifer Loven at AP. There youare.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. Earlier today in Indianayou said something striking. You said that this nation could endup in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead youto say that our recession might be permanent when others in ourhistory have not? And do you think that you risk losing somecredibility or even talking down the economy by using dire language likethat?\n\nMR. OBAMA: No, no, no,no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum,which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, thenyou potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much moredifficult for us to get outof.\n\nWe saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s,where they did notact boldly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered whatwas called the \"lost decade,\" where essentially for theentire '90s, they did not see any significant economicgrowth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo what I'm trying to underscore is whatthe people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not your ordinary,run-of-the-mill recession.\n\nWe are going through the worst economic crisis since theGreat Depression.\n\nWe've lost now 3.6 million jobs. Butwhat's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken placeover the last three months, which means that the problems areaccelerating instead of getting better.\n\nNow, what I said in Elkhart today is whatI'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solvethis problem, but it's going to require us to take somesignificant, importantsteps.\n\nStep number one, we have to pass aneconomic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was avote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. Wealready have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next severaldays that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences andget that bill on mydesk.\n\nThere have been criticisms from a bunch ofdifferent directions about this bill. So let me just address a few ofthem.\n\nSome of the criticisms really are with thebasic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace.\n\nAnd in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles thatI thought were resolved a pretty long timeago.\n\nMost economists, almost unanimously,recognize that evenif philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening inthe economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now --what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businessescan't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they startlaying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending --that when you have that situation, that government is an importantelement of introducing some additional demand into the economy. Westand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and anothertrillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole inthe economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat's why the -- the figure that weinitially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't justsome random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. Thatwas Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists thatI spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis andthe fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to havea bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net jobloss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in theright direction.\n\nNow, the recovery and reinvestment packageis not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are stillgoing to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get thecredit markets flowing again, because that's the lifeblood of theeconomy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are goingto start loosening up credit once again.\n\nAnd that means having some transparency and oversight in the system.\n\nIt means that we correct some of themistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity,in terms of how the program was going to moveforward.\n\nIt means that we condition taxpayerdollars that arebeing provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when itcomes to executive compensation, not using the money to chartercorporate jets when they're notnecessary.\n\nIt means that we focus on housing and howare we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who arestill making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline.\n\nSo there's going to be a whole range ofapproaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is tomake sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making surethat the financial system is working again, that homeowners aregetting somerelief.\n\nAnd I'm happy to get good ideas fromacross the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhat I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, becausethose theories have been tested and they have failed. And that'spart of what the election in November was all about. Okay?\n\nCaren Bohan ofReuters.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. I'd like to shift gearsto foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, andwhen will you start to implement it? Will your time table beaffected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting anyindications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the UnitedStates?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I said during thecampaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary historyand traditions, but that its actions over many years now havebeen unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both inthe region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their-- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah andHamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel,their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclearweapon -- that all of those things create the possibility ofdestabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I thinkare contrary to the interests of international peace.\n\nWhat I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal,and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security teamis currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areaswhere we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engagewith them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will belooking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting acrossthe table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow usto move our policy in a new direction.\n\nThere's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nAnd it's important that even as we engagein this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that wehave as a country, that Iran understands that we find the fundingof terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about thefact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in theregion that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going tobe a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but Ithink that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship ofmutual respect andprogress.\n\nAnd I think that if you look at howwe've approached theMiddle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy tohelp deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews thatI've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to dothings differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to sendsome signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognizethat even as it is has some rights as a member of theinternational community, with those rights come responsibilities.\n\nOkay.\n\nMR. OBAMA: ChipReid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nYou have often said that bipartisanship isextraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now whenwe ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votesin the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not thenumber of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will becreated.\n\nIs that a sign that you are moving away,your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And whatwent wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to changethe way Washingtonworked?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I don't think -- Idon't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimatedit. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up herein Washington. And it's going to take time to break down some ofthose badhabits.\n\nYou know, when I made a series ofovertures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know,putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, totalk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designedsimply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try tobuild up some trust over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated.\n\nBut understand the bottom line that I'vegot right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happeningacross the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usualpolitical games. What we have to do right now is deliver for theAmerican people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recoverypackage is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, becauseeverybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting peopleback to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, thatthey can send their kids tocollege.\n\nThat doesn't negate the continuing effortsthat I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues. Andhopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civiland respectful, will pay some dividends over the longterm.\n\nThere are going to be areas where wedisagree and there are going to be areas where we agree.\n\nAs I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been saidin Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don'tdoubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should donothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing positionin negotiations, then we're probably not going to make muchprogress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't thinkwhat -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand byand donothing.\n\nThere are others who recognize that we'vegot to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what'sin there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy tohave conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut orthis infrastructure project versus that infrastructureproject.\n\nBut what I -- what I've been concernedabout is some ofthe language that's been used suggesting that this is full of porkand this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling ofthe national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage insome revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we haveright now and the economic crisis that we have rightnow.\n\nNumber two is that, although there aresome programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't jobcreators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs shouldbe out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal withthem later.\n\nBut when they start characterizing this as porkwithout acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package --something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then youget a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actuallytrying to solve problems for the Americanpeople.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo I'm going to keep on engaging. Ihope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing togive a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is notgoing to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is,arewe creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation forlong- term economicgrowth?\n\nThis is another concern that I've had insome of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste ofmoney to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that bea waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately byretrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economicstimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federalbuildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they willsee more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence onforeign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make thatkind of investment?\n\nNow, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen todisagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselvesimporting more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s,when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate aboutwhether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don'tsuggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly whatthis countryneeds.\n\nThe same applies when it comes toinformation technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businessesand making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks offamilies all across America. And part of the reason is we've got themost inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still usingpaper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nursescan't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have writtenout. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on anelectronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-termcost of health care, and create jobs rightnow?\n\nEducation, yet another example. Thesuggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad,and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacherhas to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium iscompletely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need forthe 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, rightnow will createjobs?\n\nSo, you know, we can differ on some of theparticulars,but again, the question I think that the American people are asking is,do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it todo something? If you want it to do something, then we can havea conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option frommy perspective.\n\nAll right. Chuck Todd. Where'sChuck?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. In your opening remarks,you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work,it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumerspending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people getmoney back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or payingdown debt first, before they start spending money into theeconomy?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, first of all,I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What gotus into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild riskswith other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because ofthe enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets and theywere betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in thefinancial system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat led to a contraction of credit, whichin turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meantthat everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy.\n\nSo people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made thingsworse.\n\nNow, you are making a legitimate point,Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has beendriven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's notgoing to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending andwe're not making things, then over time, other countries are going to gettired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to beover.\n\nWell, in fact, the party now isover. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is tostop the downward spiral. And that means putting money intoconsumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit.\n\nIt means putting forward investments thatnot only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economicgrowth. And that by the way is important, even if you're afiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have,with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which thereare no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at thesame time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we'vegot more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demandfor food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget.\n\nSo the most important thing we can do forour budget crisisright now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue totank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thingto do, even though I recognize that it's expensive.\n\nLook, I would love not to have to spendmoney right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned upto spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn'thow I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt toexisting circumstances.\n\nNow, what we are going to also have to dois to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we'reno longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm andlong-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true forindividual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying tofigure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financialplanning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce the economy stabilizes and people areless fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how dowe operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a freelunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house,then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably notaffordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has tobe reconsidered.\n\nSo we're going to have to change our --our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out ofthe economic slump that we'rein.\n\nAll right. Julianna Goldman,Bloomberg.\n\nQUESTION Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nMany experts, from Nouriel Roubini toSenator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, youpromised the American people that you won't just tell them what they wantto hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government needfar more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fundto really solve the credit crisis?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it'snot over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing the TARPlegislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistencyin how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- in -- in how themoney went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as weshould have.\n\nMy immediate task is making sure that thesecond half ofthat money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my firstjob. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is tomake sure that my secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, workingwith Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, are comingup with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a waythat's transparent, in a way that provides clear oversight; that weare conditioning any money that we give to banks on themreducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and to make surethat they're not wasting thatmoney.\n\nWe are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restoredwithin the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is thatnobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank,they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open thingsup and restore sometrust.\n\nWe also have to deal with the housingissue in a clearand consistentway.\n\nI don't want to preempt my secretary ofthe Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's createa template in which we're restoring market confidence. And thereason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we'regoing to need additional money or how much additional money we'll needuntil we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidencein a marketplace that the federal government and the Federal ReserveBank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing.\n\nThat can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace. Andultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that hasbeen withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence,so that private capital goes backin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOkay.\n\nJake.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. My question followsJulianna's incontent.\n\nThe American people have seen hundreds ofbillions ofdollars spent already. And still the economy continues tofree-fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, onceall the legs of your stool are in place--\n\nMR. OBAMA: Right.\n\nQUESTION: -- how canthe American people gauge whether or notyour programs areworking?\n\nCan they -- should they be looking at themetric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric shouldthey use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether ornot we need to go to a Plan B?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I think my initialmeasure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line numberone, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidenceto make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeingthat consumers are out there with a little more confidence. Andthey start making investments, which means they start hiring workers.\n\nSo step number one, jobcreation.\n\nStep number two, are we seeing the creditmarketsoperate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businessesthat I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't getcredit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was thefact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch ofRV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, buteven though their credit is good, they can't get theloan.\n\nNow, the businesses also can't get loansto make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumerscan't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit marketsis, I think, step number two.\n\nStep number three is going to behousing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn'thave complete control over that. But if our plan is effective,working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think whatwe can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can startstabilizing housing values over time.\n\nAnd the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this isan unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficultyear -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businessesstart investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, infact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumersstart feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they startmaking purchases again. And if we get things right then, startingnext year, we can start seeing some significantimprovement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEd Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There heis.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. You've promised to sendmore troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear abouta time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months,I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventuallyfrom Afghanistan?\n\nAnd related to that, there's a Pentagonpolicy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming into Dover AirForce Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that itwas shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into thecountry under the cover ofnight.\n\nYou've promised unprecedentedtransparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the Americanpeople can see the full human cost of war?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Your question is timely. We got reportsthat four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to thefamilies.\n\nI've said before that, you know, peoplehave asked me, \"When did it hit you that you are now president?\" And what I toldthem was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of ourfallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carryin this office and the consequences of decisions that youmake.\n\nNow with respect to the policy of openingup media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewingthose policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. SoI don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that reviewand understand all the implicationsinvolved.\n\nWith respect to Afghanistan, this is goingto be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops andsome very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, wejust saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and youget a sense that the political system is now functioning in ameaningful way.\n\nYou do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national government seems verydetached from what's going on in the surrounding community. Inaddition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA andthese border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what wehaven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safehavens that would ultimately make our missionsuccessful.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo we are undergoing a thorough-goingreview. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his ownreview, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sentover -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluatea regional approach. We are going to need more effectivecoordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts withdevelopment efforts with more effective coordination with our allies in orderfor us to be successful.\n\nThe bottom line, though -- and I just want to rememberthe American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is thisis a situation in which a region served as the base to launch anattack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met withfamilies of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs ofallowing those safe havens toexist.\n\nMy bottom line is that we cannot allow alQaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're goingto have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, inorder to make sure that those safe havens don'texist.\n\nI do not have yet a timetable for how longthat's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allowal Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks onthe U.S. homeland. All right.\n\nHelene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here yougo.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you,sir.\n\nI wanted to ask you, on the next bankbailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this moneyto loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do youmake the case to the American people that this bailout will work whenthe last one didn't?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I --I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of youto show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to beterrific.\n\nBut this relates to Jake's earlierquestion. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who needit. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing tobusinesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are theyable to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth onMain Street?\n\nAnd the package that we've put together isdesigned to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim getshis moment in the sun tomorrow, allright?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMajor Garrett. Where isMajor?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President,at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversationthe two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn'tdisclose. \"If we do everything right, if we do it with absolutecertainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there'sstill a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong.\"\n\nSince the vice president brought it up,can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulusbill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with that ratioof success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success?\n\nMR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) Youknow, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try thisout.\n\nI think what Joe may have been suggesting,although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to anyof this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have,any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, notall of thesolution.\n\nAnd as I said in my introductory remarks,not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. Thisis an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk toeconomists, there's some general sense of how we're going to move forward.\n\nThere's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that youshouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment,but that there should be a range ofapproaches.\n\nBut even if we do everything right onthat, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system andmaking sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to haveto deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure thatwe've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for thefinancial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks.\n\nSo I don't know whether Joe was referringto that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about theseissues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I have noidea. I reallydon't.\n\nMichael Fletcher, The WashingtonPost.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you,sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroids as a member of theTexas Rangers?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think it'sdepressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight.\n\nAnd you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids.\n\nWhat I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated.\n\nAll right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens.\n\nThey're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children.\n\nAnd you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue.\n\nQUESTION: Did you get any promise from them?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat.\n\nWith respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger.\n\nAnd one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally.\n\nI think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that --\n\nMR. OBAMA: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nSam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam?\n\nQUESTION: Right here.\n\nMR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToday, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration.\n\nHe said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven't seen.\n\nWhat I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary.\n\nMy view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information.\n\nSo I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward.\n\nMara Liasson.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more.\n\nWhat do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it.\n\nAnd whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done.\n\nNow, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there.\n\nI mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultation.\n\nOne thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And let me give you a prime example.\n\nWhen it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility.\n\nHaving said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem.\n\nI think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards.\n\nSo my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package.\n\nAnd so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to be cleared up.\n\nBut I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide.\n\nAll right?\n\nSTAFF: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: One more, Mr. President.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, guys.", "comment_3": "Transcript: Obama's prime-time press briefing http://jijr.com/mFV", "target": "real", "comment_1": "My Unemployment Tips : Transcript: Obama's prime-time press briefing http://tinyurl.com/cto676"}

At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,\" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. \"But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation \u2014 sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) \u2014 to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.\"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\"The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.\"When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It's time for it to be increased again.\"", "comment_3": "Latest: House Minority Leader Pelosi holds weekly news conference https://t.co/h1YbPwr0kD", "target": "real", "comment_1": "(Republicans, Democrats fight over infrastructure plans By Reuters) - https://t.co/kelnEOj3vj -\u2026 https://t.co/1y8ml98VCV"}

We're talking to voters in the north, south, east and in Super Tuesday's biggest prize, California, on this AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\nAnd welcome. It's a special split edition of AMERICAN MORNING on this Super Tuesday. I'm Kiran Chetry. I'm here at one of the local schools up in Harlem, New York, where we've seen good amount of voters trickling in. Polls have been opened here for about two hours, John. And it looks like the action is heating up a little bit behind me as well, as people are coming in before they head to work to cast their votes today.\n\n\n\nJOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Good for them. I'm John Roberts. We're at the Atlanta diner here in Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody voting here, but they are fueling up in preparation to get out there and vote. It's as close as we'll come to a national primary. Well, at least this year. 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates up for grabs for the Republicans. 1,681 available for the Democrats. Most polls are open right now. We're going to be checking in with voters and our reporters across the country this morning. And we have got them from stem to stern here.\n\n\n\nGot our team on the issues talking to voters from coast to coast. Candy Crowley is live in Harlem this morning. Ed Lavandera in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chris Lawrence in San Francisco and Mary Snow is in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\n\n\nNo primary are caucus there in West Virginia, rather. A state Republican convention that gets under way in about an hour at 9:00 Eastern. 18 delegates at stake there today. And Mary joins us now live from Charleston.\n\n\n\nMary, we were speaking with Mitt Romney this morning who flew overnight from California. There really seems to be a battle in the Republican Party on this Super Tuesday as to who is the real conservative.\n\n\n\nMARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that really is what it comes down to, John, for Mitt Romney. He has been hammering away at that theme -- that trying to portray himself as the real conservative. Trying to poke holes in Senator John McCain's conservative credentials. Mitt Romney will try to make that case here in West Virginia.\n\n\n\nAs you mentioned, the convention getting under way just about an hour from now. This will likely be where we'll hear the first results across the country. Ron Paul is also going to be here. Mike Huckabee. Senator John McCain will not be here, but he will have a surrogate here for him. He is heading out to California before heading home to Arizona. Yesterday he concentrated on the northeast.\n\n\n\nOne of his big themes has been national security. Also cutting government spending. But in terms of the Republican Party, he's trying to make the case, that he can be the uniter. Mitt Romney took his message to California trying to tout his conservative credentials.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hey, we should point out, Mary, that we're looking at that polling place in Chappaqua right now. And there Hillary Clinton and her husband coming in to cast their votes. No question who she'll be voting for this morning. But let's go back to the Republican contest.\n\n\n\nWhere do these candidates need to do well? Obviously, John McCain wants to win the whole thing and become the de facto nominee tonight. But where do the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee have to do well to stay in this race?\n\n\n\nSNOW: Well, you know, for Mitt Romney, one of the states where he really has to do well is Massachusetts. John McCain was campaigning there. Mitt Romney had been governor. He says he plans on winning there. But that would be a blow to him if he did not win in Massachusetts. And obviously, he's counting a lot in California.\n\n\n\nMike Huckabee wants to gain support here in the south. He's been concentrating on that. And Ron Paul has been focusing on states like West Virginia, also Alaska. He's hoping to pick up delegates.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. Mary Snow for us this morning. Let's take it back to Kiran, who is there at Harlem.\n\n\n\nKiran, you spoke with Senator Clinton a couple of hours ago. She's there casting her ballot in Chappaqua this morning. It took just a couple of seconds as well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Yes, that's right. She actually went on early, joining us in the 6:00 hour because it's the 7:00 hour here in New York. She wanted to be at the polling site. Senator Clinton casting her vote just a few minutes ago. And earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, she talked about issues like health care and the economy and a last-minute appeal to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Really are not taking care of people. I want to put the American people first again. And you know, I think there is a lot of reason for people to worry that the president just doesn't pay attention. And I want them to know that I get it and I'll be there for them, if they are willing to go out and vote for me today. And I hope everybody watching will do that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Also a big question today, what do people in the south want in their president. Can Mike Huckabee win beyond Arkansas and can Barack Obama win beyond South Carolina? Tennessee, one of the states we're watching in the south. The polls just opened there moments ago.\n\n\n\nThere are 52 Republican delegates at stake there. 68 for the Democrats and our Ed Lavandera is in Chattanooga. He's been talking with voters this morning. You know, you can't really lump everybody in the same group and say what are southerners thinking this morning. But what is the sense here getting from this that you talk to, Ed?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, in speaking with several political analysts who look at these voters in the south, they really see, kind of a divide, between what they call the upper south and the lower south. So you have Arkansas and Tennessee perhaps going one way, maybe voting more alike and then, you have, Georgia and Alabama perhaps being a little bit more similar. But across the south, a big turnout is expected.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Presidential candidates pour on the southern charm like thick gravy on biscuits.\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not often that a razorback comes to Tuscaloosa and has a good time.\n\n\n\nJOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my sons attended Vanderbilt University. And he married a beautiful, beautiful young lady from Cookeville. And I am so -- and I am so proud of that as well. So, as you can see, I'm puling out all the stops here everybody.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: But in the south, candidates know it takes a spiritual connection, too.\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know most folks were already in church today. So I don't want to give a whole another sermon. And I won't pass the collection plate.\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day, I strive to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Across the Super Tuesday southern states of Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama, both Obama and Clinton Democrats are embracing the most popular theme on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like there's a lot of change that needs to happen as, you know, for the whole country. Not just for the south.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And some Republican leaning voters remain undecided.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: John McCain, I kind of leaning toward him in his military service and I like some of the policies that he's put forth. But Huckabee, right now, I'm leaning kind of heavy toward him.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Emory University professor Merrill Black studies the mind-set of southern voters and on Super Tuesday, he sees division on the Democratic side.\n\n\n\nMERLE BLACK, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I think we're going to see a split here. The Deep South is probably going to go for Obama. The Upper South will probably go for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And on the Republican side, he says McCain is in the driver's seat.\n\n\n\nBLACK: McCain probably will lead the field, but I think Huckabee could be competitive here. The big question mark is how well Mitt Romney would run in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And Kiran, you know, there's one voter in all of the south that many people would like to know, how this particular person is voting, al least, on the Democratic side and that is Former Vice President Al Gore who is from Tennessee, of course.\n\n\n\nWe reached out to his people yesterday and they said that -- we were told that he has already voted. He voted early. But we gave the old college try to find out who he voted for and we were told as a private citizen, he's not sharing that information.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: I am sure that everybody can make a few guesses, but he's keeping mum. All right, Ed Lavandera for us in Chattanooga this morning. Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on eight minutes after the hour now. Will weather affect voter turnout on this Super Tuesday? Our Rob Marciano is checking it out for us this morning.\n\n\n\nRob, anybody going to have a difficult time getting out to the polls today?\n\n\n\n(WEATHER REPORT)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: We're at the beginning of CNN's nonstop Super Tuesday coverage. 40 hours, all day and all night. And join us for a special early edition of AMERICAN MORNING, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And join CNN's Campbell Brown for her \"AMERICA VOTES SPECIAL\" talking to candidates and the issues. That's at noon Eastern on CNN and cnn.com.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Well, we've heard from three possible presidents this morning about the issues. What can they do for you? And we're breaking down, what they told us when it comes to key issues like health care and the economy.\n\n\n\nAlso, Super Tuesday meets the mortgage meltdown. The states voting today where the housing crisis has hit hardest. And how the candidates are promising to fix it? We're going to compare some of their plans. That's coming up ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Welcome back. We've been hearing from the candidates this morning. Let's take a moment to go through what we heard. Senior political correspondent Candy Crowley joins me in Harlem this morning. Breaking down what Democrats talked about. One of the key issues, this morning that we heard from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on health care. And let's just hear quickly what Barack Obama said just moments ago to John Roberts.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What we do is set up a plan that allows anybody to get health care that is as good as health care to the members of Congress. We will subsidize it for those who can't afford it. People won't be able to be excluded from pre-existing conditions. So that, anybody who is self-employed, anybody who doesn't health insurance or is underinsured can join this plan. Now, we also work to lower costs for those who already have health insurance.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It seems like, well, they are quite similar, Barack Obama is not going as far as saying that people would be mandated to get it if they can afford it. Hillary Clinton is, although, it's still unclear exactly how that would be enforced. But who is winning on this issue? And is this an issue that would sway voters?\n\n\n\nCANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they think -- meaning in the camp Hillary, they believe this really is a winning issue. Because she goes out and says -- you know, this is a basic, fundamental Democratic issue. We've got to start with universal health care. He sort of pushes back, as you hear, and says -- listen, I have universal health care. That's where they are going.\n\n\n\nI think Democratic voters look at this and say, they are both headed in the same direction. While there are issues in this campaign that divide them, there are about 95 percent in agreement about these issues. And they are 100 percent in agreement as to the direction they want to go.\n\n\n\nSo in the end, I think Democratic voters come to the polls and sort of say, you know, we have this one candidate who is campaigning on experience. We have another who promises to turn the page. Which direction do we want to go?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You also -- when we were talking briefly before the break, said that, you know, for the Democrats, it's also the issue of who can win it for us this year. And how do the candidates prove that at this point?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, it's all about electability at this point. And because in the end, what Democrats want is to win the oval office. So they are looking at who is the toughest and that's why you see Barack Obama now talking about John McCain, about electability. You hear him saying, you know, we don't want someone who is divisive, read that Hillary Clinton. She talks about how battle warned she is. How she knows who to go after these Republicans because they've come after her.\n\n\n\nSo they're both, in their own way, saying I'm the more electable. And that in the end is really what Democratic voters want to know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: She says, according to her, dug up all the dirt they could possibly dig up. So now they're going to go after the fresh meat.\n\n\n\nThe other interesting element about this is just the way that the Democratic primary caucuses and primaries play out. It's a different situation in terms of gathering delegates. So what does that mean and who gets the advantage, if that's the case?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: You know, first of all, it's so arcane. As you know, it's almost impossible to explain. But basically, what candidates can win a state and still lose the delegates because it's proportionately by district. So what we have to look at tonight is, first of all, who wins the states because in some ways, that's the headline.\n\n\n\nYou know, in these 20-something states, so and so wins 11 or 12. But the bottom line is that they need 2,050 votes to win this nomination. So they are all counting delegates. And I have to tell you, they are counting delegates district by district. It's why you see Barack Obama in New York. Probably Hillary Clinton will win New York, but if he can sink off enough delegates, then -- you know, he's got something there. Same with Illinois. They, in fact, think that New York will cancel out Illinois. His obviously, his home state.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It is interesting that all the four possible presidential hopefuls, all of them are Super Tuesday states. They are from Super Tuesday states.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Right. And so you start out thinking, OK, at least here I can do well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Right. There's a victory somewhere.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Exactly.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Candy, great to see you as always. Thanks.\n\n\n\nJohn? ROBERTS: Coming up, Kiran, to 17 minutes after the hour. Of course, for the last three weeks, we've been crisscrossing the nation, stopping in at diners in small towns and big cities talking to undecided voters. We've got an undecided voter this morning at the Atlanta Diner.\n\n\n\nThis is Trina Hackett. I was saying very famous name in New Zealand. They are the people who invented bungee jumping. And you are about to take a leap today. Cast your vote for -- I assume...\n\n\n\nTRINA HACKETT, UNDECIDED DEMOCRAT: Hillary.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hillary and why is that? You were undecided just a little while ago. What made up your mind here?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I was not truly made my mind. But it's like I'm saying -- more of saying she is very focused and very outstanding with everything that's going on. And more or less, she stands out more because of -- she looks out for the little people. You know -- and she's more focused on the little people. And, you know, and making sure that, you know, that -- life is going to be more easy for them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So what's the number one issue for you in this one?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: The number one issue for me is, more or less, health care. You know, for everyone, that's not being able to afford and everything.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Have you really looked into the differences between the two plans? As we've been saying this morning, there's not that great of difference.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: There's not that great of difference but -- you know, we've seen who is going to stand out. You know, who is going to make it stick. You know, what I mean? Who is going to just really, really just make it known to bring to existence, other than talk about it, but make it realistic.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And do you think -- is that based on experience that she has?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: More to say, yes. Yes. I have seen she's more -- you know, sticking around the people to understand and get to know them more better. Stand beside them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: You know, when we were in California all the way across the country, last week, one of the big issues for people was electability. Who can actually win the White House? Who do you think has the edge on that front?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I would say, Hillary. She's pretty much got it like, you know, hand packed because the more or less, I more saw her face more than I did Obama because -- I mean, I didn't know of him until he just came to run for president. You know, other than that, I was like, I didn't know him at all. ROBERTS: Obviously, she's been around for awhile. Interesting too, though, we should note that the latest polls have got Obama leading by a substantial margin here in Georgia. So if you want Hillary to win, I guess you better get out there and cast your vote.\n\n\n\nTrina Hackett, thanks very much for being with us. It's great to see you. Appreciate it. Get out there and vote today.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So California, across the country again. The big prize in this Super Tuesday on the west coast. What are voters there thinking? We take a cross-country trip coming up to show you.\n\n\n\nAnd the mortgage crisis. We've heard some of the candidates talking about it. What are their plans to fix the situation?\n\n\n\nGerri Willis will be here to tell us all about that, coming up on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Many of the states voting today are states that had been hit hard in the foreclosure crisis. We have been looking at the candidates' plans to fix it. And CNN's Gerri Willis in a hard-hit neighborhood of Atlanta this morning.\n\n\n\nGerri, what are you finding there?\n\n\n\nGERRI WILLIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey there, John. Yes, I'm in an Atlanta neighborhood where the foreclosures are highest. This zip code has the highest number of foreclosures in this city. Check out this house right behind me. It's bank-owned as you can see. Now, John, this is a largely working class community, if you can take a look at down the street here. Of the 85 homes on this street alone, some 24 are in foreclosure or have been in foreclosure.\n\n\n\nNow, the neighborhood leaders are trying to take back the community. They say much of the problem here has been the result of mortgage fraud. And John, as you've been saying all morning, of course, what's going on here is going on across the country in Super Tuesday states all over the country. No place has been hit harder than California where 1 in 52 homes is in foreclosure. Big number there. And they've lost as much as $61 billion in values in homes but also tax revenues. Lost tax revenues.\n\n\n\nAs you know, the industry provides incredible tax revenues for local governments. Other states affected here as well. You can see Colorado. We've mentioned Georgia, Arizona and Illinois.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. So we know how the scope of the problem here, Gerri, because you've been doing some great reporting on it. But what are the candidates planning to try to do to fix it? WILLIS: Well, the person who's probably been most outspoken on the mortgage meltdown is probably Hillary Clinton. She came out with legislation last year to try to clean up the problem. She wanted the big bailout, actually, to solve the issue. Here's what she said recently about what should be done.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes. And I want to freeze interest rates for five years.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWILLIS: Freeze interest rates so the people could actually work their way out of these adjustable rate mortgages which have been so difficult for folks.\n\n\n\nAlso, Obama, has also been outspoken on this topic, also introduced legislation. He wants a $10 billion bailout for the issue and he also wants to make sure that people get mortgage tax credits whether they itemize or not.\n\n\n\nNow the Republicans have been very insistent on no government. They bailout of the folks in this crisis. They think private sector solutions are the best. One little bit difference there, one change, John McCain has opened the window to some possible Federal government involvement, if the issue isn't solved by the president's current plans that are working their way through communities all across the country.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right, Gerri Willis for us this morning. Gerri, thanks very much. Now back to Harlem and here's Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You know, there were nearly 16 million registered voters in California. What's most important to them as they choose a candidate this morning? We're on the road, taking a road trip to find out.\n\n\n\nAlso, Kevin Everett, the Buffalo Bills player defied the odds in his recovery from what was describes as a catastrophic collision on the field. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the medical milestones that Kevin's made.\n\n\n\nHey, Sanjay.\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Kiran. A spinal cord injury is what he had. A lot of people have heard of that. But why do some people get to walk away when so many others don't. I'll break it down for you and tell you what help Kevin. AMERICAN MORNING is coming right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We're back from the Atlanta Diner this morning in Atlanta, Georgia. A big Super Tuesday state. This is the big prize in the south. 87 Democratic delegates available. 72 on the Republican side. And people came in this morning for some eggs and grits and headed out to cast their vote. Welcome back to AMERICAN MORNING. February 5th, Super Tuesday. I'm John Roberts in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Hey, good to see you, John. We're here at the Adam Clayton Powell School in Harlem, New York. Of course, New York another huge state on this Super Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates up for grabs, especially on the Democratic side. We've seen people trickling in and out of here 2 1/2 hours ago, is when the polls opened. It's going to be a busy day not only here but at polling sites across the nation because it is Super Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAnd it's as close as we'll come to a national primary. There are 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates for the Republicans and 1,681 delegates available for the Democrats. There's a look at the big picture map. People are already starting to line up across the northeast. Let's take a look at some of the places. How about West Hartford, Connecticut, Fort Lee, New Jersey, and also across the river from here in queens. We'll be checking back with voters as well as our reporters who have you covered from coast to coast this morning.\n\n\n\nGetting back to New Jersey now. Polls have been open there for about 2 1/2 hours as well. There are 52 delegates at stake for republicans in New Jersey. 127 for democrats and the race is special. Independent voters are allowed to cast ballots. For example, here in New York, they cannot. The closed primaries in New York state. The candidates are aiming for some of those independents. Jason Carroll is at a polling station in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to break it down for us this morning. Hi, Jason.\n\n\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: And hello to you, Kiran. You know, if you are an independent and you show up here at a fire station like this, which is a polling place, that's why you hear the alarms going off. It is a working fire station, Kiran. But it is a polling place. But if you are an independent that shows up here, you have to declare either democrat or republican before you can cast your vote. The democratic race here much too close to call. Senator Barack Obama campaigned in east Rutherford yesterday where he was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy. It's the second major rally that he has attended in northern New Jersey within the past month.\n\n\n\nSenator Clinton supporters say that she has a slight lead here in the state. Even so, she dispatched Chelsea Clinton out to do some campaigning for her on the republican side. Senator John McCain has a double-digit lead over Romney in the state but McCain still stopping through Trenton yesterday to do some last-minute campaigning. Romney sending out his son to do campaigning in the state as well. As you know, Kiran, New Jersey actually moved its primary up so they could have more impact on the presidential nominee. We spoke to some voters this morning about how that's impacting them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of sad when years past when you feel like your vote doesn't count.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a different year than usual. There are a lot of choices. And it seems that it would really make a difference.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of issues domestically we have to take care of. So with that, I think it makes it more important than ever.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCARROLL: And Kiran, we took our own informal poll about the top issues facing some of the voters here in New Jersey. The top two issues they said - number one, the economy; number two, the need for change. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Jason Carroll in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, this morning. Thank you.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, by the way, already cast her vote this morning. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted just minutes ago in Westchester county, the hometown of Chappaqua, about 30 miles north of us here in Harlem. Earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, I talked to her about some of the problems with the economy and asked what she would do to fix them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Another huge issue for people and that's the economy, recession. Some people argue we're already in one. Others say we need to pass some sort of stimulus plan and quickly to avoid one if that's the case. Right now, the House has a version. You're going to be heading back to Washington to vote on a Senate version. And meanwhile, there is talk that perhaps the longer this takes, the less effective it is. What would you do right now to try to stem the economic troubles we seem to be getting into?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I would have a very aggressive policy toward trying to stop home foreclosures. Again, I'm the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year. We need to put a moratorium on foreclosures to help people stay in their homes and we need to freeze these interest rates that continue to escalate, driving more and more people into foreclosure. A lot of people were misled. They were the victim of predatory lending practices, and we need to stabilize the housing market.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Senator Clinton also said she thinks the country is on the brink of a recession. And the Senate must get a stimulus plan through as a first step. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on 34 minutes after the hour, Kiran, Senator Barack Obama is heading back to his hometown of Chicago for a rally tonight. We had a chance to speak with him in the last hour of AMERICAN MORNING, talk about issues like Iraq and the difference between his health care plan and Senator Clinton's.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: She suggests you are falling short here by mandating coverage for children but not mandating it for their parents. What do you say?\n\n\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's break down what she really means by a mandate. What's meant by a mandate is that the government is forcing people to buy health insurance and so she's suggesting a parent is not going to buy health insurance for themselves if they can afford it. Now, my belief is that most parents will choose to get health care for themselves and we make it affordable.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: In an Obama White House, what would that strategic relationship with Iraq look like?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think, first of all, it will not have us setting up permanent bases and a permanent occupation in Iraq for decades which is what George Bush's suggested but also John McCain. I think it is important for us to say to the Iraqis that we are willing to help them. We want to be partners with them, but we are not going to be there in perpetuity. And I have been very clear. I will end this war. We will get combat troops out. I hope to do it by the end of 2009.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Senator Obama also refused to say whether he'd join a combined ticket with Hillary Clinton. He said his focus now is winning the nomination and then trying to unite the country.\n\n\n\nWell, California is a big piece of the puzzle today. Polls opened at 7:00 Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern and the republicans going after 170 delegates for the democrats' 370 are at stake. And there is no winner take all. Delegates will be awarded by congressional district making it a lot more -- making it more like a lot of mini elections instead of just one big one. So what issues are driving the voters? Our Chris Lawrence hit the road to find out. He is live for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, good morning.\n\n\n\nCHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. You know, 1 out of every 8 Americans lives in California. That gives you an idea of the sheer size of this primary. And the voters here are making their decisions based on immigration, health care and most of all, the economy.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE (voice-over): 80 miles east of L.A., Betty Larkins is packing up. After the bank foreclosed on her home.\n\n\n\nBETTY LARKINS: People are saying something about a recession might come. To me, we're in one.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty beat cancer, but she's losing her home because she went broke paying hospital bills.\n\n\n\nLARKINS: See, I didn't even know what it cost for a mammogram until I didn't have insurance.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Based on her health care plans, she's narrowed it down to Obama and Clinton.\n\n\n\nLARKINGS: But I have to pray about it a lot before I make my decision.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty is just one member of the country's most diverse electorate. And California is super Tuesday's biggest prize. There are more people living in Los Angeles county than the entire state of Michigan. We wanted to hear from even more of California's nearly 16 million registered voters, and they are spread out all over the state.\n\n\n\nDriving hundreds of miles to the more agricultural area around Fresno, we found problems for one front-runner.\n\n\n\nJOE MENDOZA, UNDECIDED VOTER: McCain is wishy washy.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Joe Mendoza hasn't decided which other republican he'll vote for.\n\n\n\nMENDOZA: Immigration is a big factor with me right now. To see what they are going to do. This country can't keep sending all our jobs off.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: The next day, we're back on the road to the Bay Area where all that Clinton-Obama advertising has some new company.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, the GOP is awarding delegates to the winner in each congressional district. So republican candidates are campaigning in heavily democratic areas like San Francisco because even a small number there could deliver a win.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you are more part of the process.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: This registered republican is voting for Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Iraq is going to take care of itself with the surge. It's working. But I care about people who are going to actually create jobs. Keep taxes down so that companies can grow.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Yes, one thing about California, a lot of the voters, in fact perhaps half of the voters will vote by absentee ballots. A lot of us who live here, our friends and our family, have already voted. With that in mind, two things to keep in mind today. Barack Obama's late surge and Mitt Romney's conservative challenge to John McCain. How much effect will they really have on the vote totals? John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: It's really becoming an incredibly tight race there. Chris Lawrence for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, thanks. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: A lot of people may still have, John, last-minute questions about the candidates. Not sure where to go to vote today or exactly who they're going to vote for. We have the most up-to-the- minute information for you. Super Tuesday information just ahead.\n\n\n\nAnd also, we see the amazing story of Kevin Everett of the Buffalo Bills. The progress he has made after a spinal cord injury that first was described as catastrophic. How did he and his doctors do it? We're paging our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Oh, hey, we're back. We're back here at the Adam Clayton Powell Elementary, one of the voting sites here in New York today. There's a pretty healthy turnout so far. Polls open here about 6:00 Eastern time. It opened for a little more than 2 1/2 hours right now. Steady stream of people. We wanted to talk to some of the voters and see why they chose the way they did this morning. And joining us is Khalid Kamau. He recently transplanted from Atlanta. You said you were tired of living in a red state. You wanted to move to New York. You work for a non-profit organization right here in Harlem. Tell us a little bit about what went into picking a candidate today.\n\n\n\nKHALID KAMAU, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Well, my roommates and I, we all watched all the debates. We're like tivoing and going back and forth. But just listening to the positions was really - I really felt I can say who I voted for - Hillary - I just felt on the issue that was most important to me, which was health care and several other issues. She really articulated a very detailed position. And, you know, I was really torn, especially after the whole like South Carolina debacle with like Barack and Bill, but --\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Did that turn you off a little what went on in South Carolina, the issues of race?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Yes, it definitely did. I mean, just I think that everyone, you know, would love to see a president or an executive that looks like them. You know, in representative government that's true representation. But I really just felt that she just had a little bit better articulation of some of the issues that were really important, you know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: When you talk about that, this is an issue that Barack Obama himself has talked about and said, I don't really want this to be an issue of race. I don't want people to vote for me just because I could be the first black president. Were those issues of race something that you -- that you took into consideration?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Oh, yes, of course. You can't - I think as much as and you hear a lot of pundits, even reporters saying - you know, talk about how Barack transcends race. I just, we're not there as a country yet where we can just transcend. We can't vote for Barack and the past 400 years of history would like all be fixed. And it's the same thing with, I think, sexism and Hillary Clinton. So it really -- that's always just going to play a huge part.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: But for you, it came down to the individual person and what they were proposing to make your life better?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: It is really is. It really came down to health care. And I just think that we have to - I think Hillary is right when she says that we have to try to cover everyone. You know we have to at least start there.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It's interesting because your mother actually voted for Barack Obama. So you guys had healthy debates over the dinner table?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: She did. We were actually a Hillary family. My mother and father. We were all very pro-Hillary. I think everything kind of turned in South Carolina. And I didn't know actually until this morning when I called her that she changed her vote. But I think that it's just - I don't know. It's just really a profound thing. I think a lot of people are even split with the delegates. I think that every year, every election cycle, it seems like they are finding out some new critical piece of this elaborate election mechanism.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: That's right. But every vote counts. And you certainly cast yours for Hillary. Khalid Kamau, thanks so much for joining us. And you know, it's very interesting, John, just how informed people are for this primary and for this upcoming general election. As you heard from Khalid, he watched every debate, tivoed it if he didn't see it. And that is what we're hearing from a lot of voters. They want, they're hungry for the type of information and they know that they're taking part in an historical decision. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Yes. All you have to do is look at the ratings for our debates to know that people have really been dialed in. We talked to so many people across the country and they are so excited on the republican side and the democratic side about participating in this election.\n\n\n\nWe've been talking about the incredible recovery of Kevin Everett from the Buffalo Bills. Just five months after suffering a spinal cord injury during the Bills' home opener. Kevin Everett is walking again now. He told Kiran it's a recovery that no one would have predicted.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEVIN EVERETT, BUFFALO BILLS: That's my collar.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Unfortunately, we had a little problem with that. But he said people didn't give him much of a chance to recover and he came back. How did Everett and his doctors do it? We're paging Dr. Sanjay Gupta for that. Sanjay joins us now. How did they do it?\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's not sure exactly what happened here. There's obviously a lot of people have spinal cord injuries who never recover the way he did. But I tell you, he's a pretty happy guy there. Dominik Hickson, by the way, who tackled him is very happy guy as well because Kevin is walking. We know several things about his recovery. One is that he got a very early surgery. His operation was quickly. That's important. He also got this therapy, known as hypothermic therapy, actually cooling his spinal cord, cooling his body. Although it's unclear exactly when that was instituted. But take a look at the timeline here. Now, the operation and the injury at the end of September. He had the operation within ten days, he was in a rehabilitation facility. Within week two, he was able to take some steps with a walker. Within week three, standing on his own. By October 30th, he was getting out of bed and eventually on November 18th, he was discharged. So pretty speedy recovery, John. But again, out of which of those things actually made the difference? It's really unclear.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Why did he recover when so many others don't?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Well, you know, you talk about this hypothermic therapy, which is essentially cooling the spinal cord. A lot of people say that's just anecdotal. There's no sort of scientific evidence that works. In his case in particular, what we know is that he got the hypothermic therapy started after the surgery, according to the neurosurgeon who took care of him. So, it's hard to say if that made a difference. He also had a central cord injury, John. It's a type of spinal cord injury from which a lot of people do recover. In fact, in his age group, over 90% of people do recover to some extent.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: How has that different from the debilitating type of injury like Christopher Reeve's?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Right, you're talking about complete spinal cord injury where the entire spinal cord is crushed to some extent. In Kevin Everett's case, according to his rehab doctors, he suffered more of a central spinal cord injury where it's more of a bruising. Think of it as a bruising to the spinal cord where the central most fibers of the spinal cord are the most damaged. The crucial thing there is, John, if you follow those patients over time, a lot of them do recover as long as they have the surgery and the time.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And you should know all about this, Mr. Neurosurgeon.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Obviously, happy for him. He'll walk again. Hard to say if he'll play football again but he's going to walk again.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: He said he's going to get into some businesses and see how it goes after that. Sanjay, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: CNN NEWSROOM just minutes away now. Heidi Collins down the street at the CNN Center with a look at what's ahead.

John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So will weather affect voter turnout on this super Tuesday? There's some bad weather moving into parts of the country. Our Rob Marciano checking it out for us this morning from the CNN weather center just down the street. Good morning, Rob.\n\n\n\nROB MARCIANO, CNN, METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John. Yes, we got a big storm that's running across the country. It's going to bring the gamut as far as weather is concerned through a number of states holding their primaries and caucuses. Kansas, Oklahoma, you'll be under the gun for snow. And after some morning rain and thunderstorms and severe thunderstorms expected across Arkansas and through the mid-Mississippi River Valley, western parts of Tennessee, we could very well see damaging winds and violent tornadoes, especially in Arkansas. Where the storm's prediction center has just upgraded their outlook for today to a high-risk area. That is very rare for this time of year, especially this far north.\n\n\n\nThe main reason, among other things. We got strong winds at the midlevels. We got a lot of heat, 67 Little Rock. 69 degrees in Dallas. And a lot of cold behind that. 32 degrees in Amarillo and 17 degrees right now in Denver, Colorado. So cold mixing with the warm and you got the fireworks, that's for sure.\n\n\n\nWe have severe thunderstorm watch out for north Texas. Likely a tornado watch issued in about an hour for Arkansas and behind the system we have snow. Eastern Colorado through Kansas back through Illinois. Winter storm warnings are posted for several inches of snow possible and then storms extend towards the east coast. Looks like it will be wet for much of New York state. A lot of action. A lot of bad weather to folks heading to the polls. Don't let it discourage you. It will be gorgeous here in parts of the southeast. But if you have some weather to deal with, tell the folks to get out there and get it done.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Boy, bundle up in Colorado today. Rob, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: All right.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Quickly now to what CNN NEWSROOM is working on for the top of the hour.\n\n\n\nCOLLINS: See these stories in the CNN NEWSROOM. Super Tuesday -- voting under way now in the biggest single day of primaries in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nStormy Tuesday. Tornadoes possible from Texas to the lower Midwest.\n\n\n\nBaseball's Roger Clemens on Capitol Hill and under oath about steroids.\n\n\n\nA ticker tape parade today for the \"Super Bowl\" champion New York Giants. And a boy seriously stuck in a washing machine. NEWSROOM top of the hour on CNN.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's going to wrap it up for us and our tour of the battleground states leading into super Tuesday. A little bittersweet moment. But Kiran and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: That's right. Finally, John is coming back to New York City. We miss you. We're glad to be there as we start at 5:00 a.m. I'll bring the coffee. Don't worry. CNN NEWSROOM with Heidi Collins gets underway right now.\n\n\n\nCOLLINS: Good morning, everybody.

{"split": "train", "comment_2": "NowBrowsing: China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites - Popular Mechanics http://t.co/jeGrqom", "text": "At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small\u2014just 6 ft. long\u2014a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and\u2014boom\u2014obliterated it. \"It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,\" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. \"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,\" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. \"China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there.\" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti\u00c2\u00adsatellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. \"Space debris is a huge problem,\" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed.\" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials\u2014reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance\u2014chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space\n\n1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n2] Experts believe a four-stage, solid\u00c2\u00ad-fuel launch vehicle\u2014thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2\u2014boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nNASA\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. \"You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,\" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. \"You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them.\"\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. \"There'd be so much debris up there,\" Clark says, \"that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. \"The consensus,\" Clark says, \"was that anybody could look at anybody else.\"\n\nDiagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.\n\nOver the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985 the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at Global\u00c2\u00adSecurity says, \"It's an act of war.\"\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n--Davin Coburn\n\n1] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.\n\n2] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985, when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n3] In 1997 the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program.\n\n4] The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. \"The experiment is not targeted at any other country,\" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that \"The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\"\n\nThe United States \"basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,\" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: \"Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.\"\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. \"The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,\" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\"\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\n\"The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,\" Pike says. \"Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time.\" A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that's all it would take. \"Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. \"It was a mistake,\" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, \"It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,\" Vick says. \"It is a threat, and the test showed that.\" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only 60 satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, \"just nothing to shoot at.\"\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY 2007\n\nJANUARY 2008\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. \"Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,\" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know.\" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles -- and Kessler's looming threat. -- Erin McCarthy\n\nThe debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nSource: Analysis courtesy of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation/Analytical Graphics, Inc. Data as of April 26, 2007. Objects greatly magnified for visibility.\n\nLitter Kings Sad to say, but some space junk -- such as spent boosters -- simply comes with the territory. Other flotsam results from indifference or lousy planning, such as the bags of garbage Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned from the MIR space station for 15 years. Here's how the three busiest space players stack up.\n\nUnited States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles.\n\nRussia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately 1200 pieces of fresh debris.\n\nChina: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. \"Almost 85 percent of that debris will be in orbit in 100 years,\" says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. \"It shows how badly they messed things up with one event.\" -- E.M.", "comment_3": "China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites - Popular Mechanics - http://goo.gl/tup1y", "target": "real", "comment_1": "China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites http://shar.es/XO7j9"}

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2014 literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\n\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d However, Peskov suspiciously asked \u201cvere is Moose and Squirrel?\u201d\n\nNSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people\u2019s brains, he\u2019s \u201cnever seen anything on this scale before.\u201d\n\nThe Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.\n\nYou are all nuts\u2026almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don\u2019t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands.

He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.\n\nSeveral children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.\n\nWhile Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201d\n\nHe said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. \u201cagainst our national interests.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s talking about and whether he\u2019s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.\n\nBut it obviously raises a concerning question.\n\nThere have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to believe.\n\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.\n\nThe problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can\u2019t get a straight answer.\n\nAsked about the cleric\u2019s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.\u201d Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official\u2019s allegation. \u201cThis sounds like totally made up BS,\u201d she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.\n\nThis would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.\n\nAnd in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran\u2019s elite. \u201cMany ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,\u201d Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. \u201cThe regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.\u201d Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: \u201cIranians don\u2019t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.\u201d\n\nThe protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn\u2019t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.\n\nBut it could be interesting if it\u2019s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.", "comment_3": "Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama Secretly Gave Citizenship to 2500 Iranians as Part of Nuke Deal https://t.co/h8nRX5OByX", "target": "fake", "comment_1": "Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama Secretly Gave Citizenship to 2500 Iranians as Part of Nuke Deal\u2026 https://t.co/sA87S7h07b"}

They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn\u2019t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might\u2019ve been exposed to.\n\n(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)\n\nChemical attack or no, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn\u2019t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning.

The listing, posted on May 19, 2017, was taken down just days later, though it is unclear as to whether the estranged couple found a renter, or if the property was taken off the market for other reasons.\n\nTheir modern apartment, located on the 14th and 15th floors, has a view that overlooks Union Square Park and extends out over the midtown skyline. There are 670 units in the apartment block, divided into four blocks: Gramercy, Village, Park, and University. There is a communal pool, gym, and grassy rooftop for residents to enjoy.\n\nThe former congressman, who is currently in prison, is eligible to begin his three years supervised release in August 2019.\n\nIt certainly will be interesting to see what they come up with in order to explain away what appears to be a murder at the apartment building where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner own a home. Will they call it a robbery, like in the case of Seth Rich? Perhaps the better question is this: What did this woman know about Hillary Clinton?", "comment_3": "Watch \"Hillary In Hiding As Police Discover Dead Body Hidden In Huma Abedin\u2019s Dumpster\" on YouTube\nhttps://t.co/76XPjFykIf", "target": "fake", "comment_1": "Hillary In Hiding As Police Discover Dead Body Hidden In Huma Abedin\u2019s Dumpster: https://t.co/2oiRyqmans"}

He Hasn't Stopped https://t.co/BcitRdbowm", "text": "David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a \u201cpop\u201d while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a \u201cCode Red\u201d exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.\n\nAnd then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor\u2014Hogg doesn\u2019t know his name but calls him an angel\u2014knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg\u2014who\u2019s an editor at the school\u2019s TV station\u2014found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.\n\nThe shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in there, I thought, \u2018What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?\u2019\u201d Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. \u201cAnd the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that\u2019s all I could think: Get other people\u2019s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that\u2019s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It\u2019s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it\u2019s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.\n\n\u201cWhen do we say, that\u2019s not acceptable, something has to change?\u201d asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.\n\nHogg\u2019s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action\n\nWill Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman\u2019s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven\u2019t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn\u2019t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher\u2019s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.\n\n\u201cIt was hot in there. We were packed in tight,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cSome students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.\u201d Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.\n\n\u201cMy husband is ex-military, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re anti-gun. But an AR-15?\u201d Kristi Gilroy said. \u201cYou tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?\u201d Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she\u2019d taught when they were younger.\n\nThe usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. \u201cNow, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,\u201d Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. \u201cOur students are asking for that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.\n\n\u201cTo every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she\u2019d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. \u201cHaving to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,\u201d she said, her eyes full of tears.\n\nTo some, however, words of comfort won\u2019t be enough. \u201cWhen do we actually stand up? I think it\u2019s the time that we all stand up,\u201d Hogg demanded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it\u2019s going to be your child that\u2019s next. And that\u2019s horrifying.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it\u2019s okay to go back to school, that they\u2019re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "comment_3": "A Student Started Filming During the Florida School Shooting.

We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States\u2026\n\nTHE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:\n\n\u2018DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!\u2019 The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York\u2019s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.\n\nHe has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.\n\nWhile executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about \u2018attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said further that he would \u2018continue to create chaos\u2019 for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.\n\nIT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It\u2019s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.\n\nAlthough he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world\u2019s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.\n\nHe has told people in the communications industry that he is \u2018very interested in communications,\u2019 which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.\n\nThe Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him \u2018a real-estate genius\u2019 who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970\u2019s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.\n\nMany urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. \u2018With manufacturing leaving,\u2019 says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, \u2018and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.\u2019\n\nThe rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.\n\nThat Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump\u2019s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.\n\n\u2018He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,\u2019 a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.\n\nThe day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.\n\nFor a billion-dollar corporation, there aren\u2019t too many people around.\n\nDonald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.\n\nSays Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: \u2018If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.\u2019 Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.\n\n\u2018He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,\u2019 says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. \u2018I don\u2019t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,\u2019 he says, \u2018but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: \u2018Tell us what you want, you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u2019\n\n\u2018Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,\u2019 says a developer\u2026 He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.\u2019\n\nRoy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s friend and attorney, adds: \u2018He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.\u2019\n\nSuch was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970\u2019s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son\u2019s efforts to buy the hotel as \u2018fighting for a seat on the Titanic.\u2019 But, Donald Trump says, \u2018I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, \u2018How bad can this be?\u201d He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.\n\nHe had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. \u2018If the seller was Italian,\u2019 says Mr. Trump, \u2018we sent an Italian\u2019 \u2013 something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in his genes,\u2019 says Fred Trump, explaining his son\u2019s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.\n\n\u2018Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,\u2019 says Mr. Fischer. \u2018We\u2019ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.\u2019\n\nHis success also derives from his marketing skills. \u2018I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,\u2019 Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers \u2013 including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses \u2013 go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.\n\nSome developers find Mr. Trump\u2019s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.\n\nPreston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city\u2019s convention center, concludes: \u2018He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.\u2019\n\nThe condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another \u2018super luxury\u2019 building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? \u2018You sell them a fantasy,\u2019 Mr. Trump explains. \u2018He deserves full credit for his success,\u2019 says another builder. \u2018He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: \u2018Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?\u201d\n\n\u2018What sets Trump apart,\u2019 says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, \u2018is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.\u2019\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t use the term \u2018settlement\u2019 with Donald.\u2019\n\nMr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.\n\nHe speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.\n\nHe talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.\n\nHis father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn\u2019t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.\n\nMr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.\n\nHis friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to \u201921\u2019 for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn\u2019t quite realize that he\u2019s one of them.\n\nAfter dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.\n\nAsked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?\n\nHe says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.\n\nHis greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements \u2013 he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.\n\nThe idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.\n\nHe is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.\n\nHe dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.\n\nAREN\u2019T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!\n\nsource:https://100percentfedup.com", "comment_3": "JUST RELEASED: EXPLOSIVE ANTHONY BOURDAIN Interview\u2026Bill Clinton Is \u201ca piece of s**t, entitled, rapey, gropey, grab\u2026 https://t.co/z7ebFi8F7b", "target": "fake", "comment_1": "LONDON: VOCAL, PRO-TRUMP Former Ambassador To US Beaten To A Pulp Night Before Trump Arrives In UK *\u2026 https://t.co/4P2y4RuCf7"}

You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.\n\nThe program, called \u201cTax Relief For Deserving Americans,\u201d will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:\n\nWhile deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being \u201creported\u201d by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration.

They also don\u2019t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that much money in the grand scheme. We\u2019ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we\u2019ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out.

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it\u2019s time to take urgent action as he\u2019s announced in a shocking message to Americans.\n\nWith all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.\n\nFatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.\n\n\u201cFebruary\u2019s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,\u201d Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he\u2019s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.\n\nDuring his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build \u201ca great, great wall along our southern border\u201d \u2014 in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d \u201cOur terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,\u201d Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won\u2019t stop it completely, he\u2019s the first to address the epidemic that\u2019s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.\n\nWhile Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it\u2019s a step in the right direction and he\u2019s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on seasonal \u201cgenerosity.\u201d She related the story of St. Matthew\u2019s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can\u2019t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders\u2019 story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such \u201cstories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that\u2019s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.\n\nskip - Ivanka Trump tweet\n\nAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on \u201cthis sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.\u201d\n\nskip - Ivanka's defiance\n\nTRUMP\u2019s DAUGHTER IS AGAINST CHRISTMAS!!!

She dared do this in a tweet that included a photo of her posing in front of Christmas trees. \u2014 Joan Strong (@TruthInJeopardy) December 23, 2017\n\nShapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had \u201cworked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.\u201d He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nskip - Eric Trump tweet\n\nBut as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn\u2019t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.\n\nTrue, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it \u2013 though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nIndeed, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the \u201creturn to Merry Christmas\u201d message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.\n\nShe seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d with no mention of the \u201cC-word,\u201d in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father\u2019s \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d rhetoric.\n\nFor those who would chalk up Ivanka\u2019s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.\n\nEven Melania Trump\u2019s much publicized \u2013 and much maligned \u2013 choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a cr\u00e8che display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.\n\nAll of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump\u2019s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and pro-\u201cHappy Holidays\u201d conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn\u2019t at all reflective of mainstream America.\n\nThat feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than they had in the past.\n\nThe Pew poll reported: \u201cA rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d\n\nskip - Politicization of Christmas\n\nI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. \u2014 Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.\n\nskip - Feraz Ozel tweet\n\n\u2018My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas\u2019 \u2014 Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the \u2018War on Christmas\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017\n\nThis year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business\u2019 choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third \u2013 32 percent \u2013 said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d during the holidays.\n\nOverall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump\u2019s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe that the \u201cbiblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events\u201d is \u201cshrinking,\u201d it said, and \u201ca declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d obsession shores up his status with evangelicals \u2013 even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don\u2019t care much how it\u2019s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.\n\nIn a blow to the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d theory from one of Trump\u2019s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 if the time is right,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cJust because some people say \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to people who don\u2019t celebrate it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.\u201d", "comment_3": "WAR ON CHRISTMAS: OBAMA ORDERS BAN ON CHRISTMAS CARDS TO MILITARY #uspoli #cdnpoli  https://t.co/HNd0K9IDJJ", "target": "fake", "comment_1": "WAR ON CHRISTMAS: OBAMA ORDERS BAN ON CHRISTMAS CARDS TO MILITARY https://t.co/NMulPtbE9V"}
