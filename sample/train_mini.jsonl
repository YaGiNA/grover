It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform. And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.\n\nOur collective failure to meet this challenge \u2013 year after year, decade after decade \u2013 has led us to a breaking point. Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans. Some can't get insurance on the job. Others are self-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.\n\nWe are the only advanced democracy on Earth \u2013 the only wealthy nation \u2013 that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.\n\nBut the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.\n\nOne man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.\n\nThen there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many employers \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally \u2013 like our automakers \u2013 are at a huge disadvantage. And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it \u2013 about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care.\n\nFinally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform this system. The question is how.\n\nThere are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada's, where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone. On the right, there are those who argue that we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.\n\nI have to say that there are arguments to be made for both approaches. But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have. Since health care represents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch. And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.\n\nDuring that time, we have seen Washington at its best and its worst.\n\nWe have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week. That has never happened before. Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups and even drug companies \u2013 many of whom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber on about eighty percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.\n\nBut what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward their own government. Instead of honest debate, we have seen scare tactics. Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise. Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge. And out of this blizzard of charges and counter-charges, confusion has reigned.\n\nWell the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.\n\nThe plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:\n\nIt will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge \u2013 not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans \u2013 and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.\n\nHere are the details that every American needs to know about this plan:\n\nFirst, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.\n\nThat's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan \u2013 more security and stability.\n\nNow, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange \u2013 a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.\n\nFor those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it.\n\nNow, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those \u2013 particularly the young and healthy \u2013 who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek \u2013 especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions \u2013 just can't be achieved.\n\nThat's why under my plan, individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance \u2013 just as most states require you to carry auto insurance. Likewise, businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care, or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers. There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage, and 95% of all small businesses, because of their size and narrow profit margin, would be exempt from these requirements. But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees. Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part.\n\nWhile there remain some significant details to be ironed out, I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined: consumer protections for those with insurance, an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage, and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life, as well as the economy as a whole. Still, given all the misinformation that's been spread over the past few months, I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform. So tonight I'd like to address some of the key controversies that are still out there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of people's concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost. The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Such a charge would be laughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.\n\nThere are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false \u2013 the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally. And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up \u2013 under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\nMy health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a \"government takeover\" of the entire health care system. As proof, critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly-sponsored insurance option, administered by the government just like Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nSo let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly \u2013 by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.\n\nInsurance executives don't do this because they are bad people. They do it because it's profitable. As one former insurance executive testified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill; they are rewarded for it. All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called \"Wall Street's relentless profit expectations.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They provide a legitimate service, and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors. I just want to hold them accountable. The insurance reforms that I've already mentioned would do just that. But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not-for-profit public option available in the insurance exchange. Let me be clear \u2013 it would only be an option for those who don't have insurance. No one would be forced to choose it, and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance. In fact, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, we believe that less than 5% of Americans would sign up.\n\nDespite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don't like this idea. They argue that these private companies can't fairly compete with the government. And they'd be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option. But they won't be. I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects. But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits, excessive administrative costs and executive salaries, it could provide a good deal for consumers. It would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.\n\nIt's worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I've proposed tonight. But its impact shouldn't be exaggerated \u2013 by the left, the right, or the media. It is only one part of my plan, and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles. To my progressive friends, I would remind you that for decades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it. The public option is only a means to that end \u2013 and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal. And to my Republican friends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government takeover of health care, we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have.\n\nFor example, some have suggested that that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas worth exploring. But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans can't find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a choice. And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinally, let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me, to members of this chamber, and to the public \u2013 and that is how we pay for this plan.\n\nHere's what you need to know. First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits \u2013 either now or in the future. Period. And to prove that I'm serious, there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize. Part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for \u2013 from the Iraq War to tax breaks for the wealthy. I will not make that same mistake with health care.\n\nSecond, we've estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system \u2013 a system that is currently full of waste and abuse. Right now, too much of the hard-earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care doesn't make us healthier. That's not my judgment \u2013 it's the judgment of medical professionals across this country. And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn fact, I want to speak directly to America's seniors for a moment, because Medicare is another issue that's been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.\n\nMore than four decades ago, this nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years. That is how Medicare was born. And it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next. That is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.\n\nThe only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies \u2013 subsidies that do everything to pad their profits and nothing to improve your care. And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.\n\nThese steps will ensure that you \u2013 America's seniors \u2013 get the benefits you've been promised. They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations. And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pocket for prescription drugs. That's what this plan will do for you. So don't pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut \u2013 especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program. That will never happen on my watch. I will protect Medicare.\n\nNow, because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system, making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody. We have long known that some places, like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, offer high-quality care at costs below average. The commission can help encourage the adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system \u2013 everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan. Much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers. This reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money \u2013 an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts. And according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long-run.\n\nFinally, many in this chamber \u2013 particularly on the Republican side of the aisle \u2013 have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care. I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs. So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine. I know that the Bush Administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual states to test these issues. It's a good idea, and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today.\n\nAdd it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over ten years \u2013 less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration. Most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent \u2013 but spent badly \u2013 in the existing health care system. The plan will not add to our deficit. The middle-class will realize greater security, not higher taxes. And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of one percent each year, it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.\n\nThis is the plan I'm proposing. It's a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight \u2013 Democrats and Republicans. And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead. If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be there to listen. My door is always open.\n\nBut know this: I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than improve it. I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are. If you misrepresent what's in the plan, we will call you out. And I will not accept the status quo as a solution. Not this time. Not now.\n\nEveryone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing. Our deficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will close. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most. And more will die as a result. We know these things to be true.\n\nThat is why we cannot fail. Because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed \u2013 the ones who suffer silently, and the ones who shared their stories with us at town hall meetings, in emails, and in letters.\n\nI received one of those letters a few days ago. It was from our beloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. He had written it back in May, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal. He asked that it be delivered upon his death.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks to the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, and his children, who are here tonight . And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform \u2013 \"that great unfinished business of our society,\" he called it \u2013 would finally pass. He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity, but he also reminded me that \"it concerns more than material things.\" \"What we face,\" he wrote, \"is above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.\"\n\nI've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days \u2013 the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry debate.\n\nFor some of Ted Kennedy's critics, his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty. In their mind, his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.\n\nBut those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here \u2013 people of both parties \u2013 know that what drove him was something more. His friend, Orrin Hatch, knows that. They worked together to provide children with health insurance. His friend John McCain knows that. They worked together on a Patient's Bill of Rights. His friend Chuck Grassley knows that. They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities.\n\nOn issues like these, Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick; and he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance; what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent \u2013 there is something that could make you better, but I just can't afford it.\n\nThat large-heartedness \u2013 that concern and regard for the plight of others \u2013 is not a partisan feeling. It is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character. Our ability to stand in other people's shoes. A recognition that we are all in this together; that when fortune turns against one of us, others are there to lend a helping hand. A belief that in this country, hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play; and an acknowledgement that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise.\n\nThis has always been the history of our progress. In 1933, when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism. But the men and women of Congress stood fast, and we are all the better for it. In 1965, when some argued that Medicare represented a government takeover of health care, members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, did not back down. They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind.\n\nYou see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem. They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom. But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, and the vulnerable can be exploited. And they knew that when any government measure, no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial, is subject to scorn; when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un-American; when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom, and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter \u2013 that at that point we don't merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges. We lose something essential about ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat was true then remains true today. I understand how difficult this health care debate has been. I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them. I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road \u2013 to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one more term.\n\nBut that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test.\n\nBecause that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our character.

Whenever there\u2019s something the G.O.P. doesn\u2019t like \u2014 say, environmental protection \u2014 Heritage can be counted on to produce a report, based on no economic model anyone else recognizes, claiming that this policy would cause huge job losses. Correspondingly, whenever there\u2019s something Republicans want, like tax cuts for the wealthy or for corporations, Heritage can be counted on to claim that this policy would yield immense economic benefits.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe point is that the two parties don\u2019t just live in different moral universes, they also live in different intellectual universes, with Republicans in particular having a stable of supposed experts who reliably endorse whatever they propose.\n\nSo when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where\u2019s the common ground?\n\nEventually, of course, America must choose between these differing visions. And we have a way of doing that. It\u2019s called democracy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nNow, Republicans claim that last year\u2019s midterms gave them a mandate for the vision embodied in their budget. But last year the G.O.P. ran against what it called the \u201cmassive Medicare cuts\u201d contained in the health reform law. How, then, can the election have provided a mandate for a plan that not only would preserve all of those cuts, but would go on, over time, to dismantle Medicare completely?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, polls suggest that the public\u2019s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that\u2019s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.\n\nWhich brings me to those calls for a bipartisan solution. Sorry to be cynical, but right now \u201cbipartisan\u201d is usually code for assembling some conservative Democrats and ultraconservative Republicans \u2014 all of them with close ties to the wealthy, and many who are wealthy themselves \u2014 and having them proclaim that low taxes on high incomes and drastic cuts in social insurance are the only possible solution.\n\nThis would be a corrupt, undemocratic way to make decisions about the shape of our society even if those involved really were wise men with a deep grasp of the issues. It\u2019s much worse when many of those at the table are the sort of people who solicit and believe the kind of policy analyses that the Heritage Foundation supplies.\n\nSo let\u2019s not be civil. Instead, let\u2019s have a frank discussion of our differences. In particular, if Democrats believe that Republicans are talking cruel nonsense, they should say so \u2014 and take their case to the voters.", "comment_3": "A sensible column, as usual, by Paul Krugman in @nytimes , with a complementary commentary by this tweeter.\nhttps://t.co/jMHL3VjQ7s", "split": "train"}

REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic\n\n\u201cThis proposal is coming before the secretary this week,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. \u201cHe will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it.\u201d\n\nViolence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.\n\nFor months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces.\n\nGates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan \u2014 a record high.\n\nAround half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops.\n\nWhile NATO says it thwarted last year\u2019s attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month.\n\nIN PLACE BY APRIL\n\nMorrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops.\n\nHe suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden.\n\n\u201cThe commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load,\u201d Morrell said.\n\nU.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nRelated Coverage Mine blast kills NATO soldier in Afghanistan\n\nMorrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday.\n\nThe plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said.", "comment_3": "Blackanthem.com\n\nMilitary Leaders Seek 3000 More Troops for Afghanistan\nNew York Times - 2 hours ago\nBy THOM SHANKER WASHINGTON - Senior ...", "split": "train"}

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN projects Mitt Romney the winner, the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN projects that the former Massachusetts governor has a decisive win in the caucuses in Nevada. Mitt Romney going ahead, capitalizing on his dramatic win in Florida, now capturing Nevada as well.\n\n\n\nWe do not -- we do not yet know who's going to come in second, who's going to come in third. But there is a dramatic -- a dramatic race under way for second and third place. But now you can see Romney headquarters in Las Vegas. The crowd hearing the news that Mitt Romney has won the Nevada caucuses. Very, very excited.\n\n\n\nJim Acosta is our man over at Mitt Romney headquarters in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nJim, the crowd pretty excited there, as they should be.\n\n\n\nJIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. This is a very pumped up crowd. It's also a very big crowd. You know, we talked over the last couple of weeks that this campaign that Mitt Romney has at times had trouble drawing large crowds. That is not the case tonight. It's a very big boisterous crowd here for the former Massachusetts governor.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, we are expecting to see Mitt Romney come out here and address this crowd within the hour. It was thought that he might come on in about an hour from now, but they might move things up a little sooner. They obviously have some ground to cover over the next couple of days.\n\n\n\nAnd I will tell you that one interesting thing, I think, that you can point to from the Romney campaign, a sign of confidence perhaps is they're kind of taking a day off tomorrow, Wolf, after they wrap up this day. They're having a down day here in Las Vegas. They're probably going to watch a football game tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBut then it's off to Colorado to get ready for the Tuesday caucuses in that state. But you can hear the crowd chanting behind me, \"Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\" This is a very happy crowd here tonight and for good reason. Mitt Romney is doing something tonight that he hasn't done in this campaign so far -- that's win two in a row -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The event tonight, where you are, where in Las Vegas are you, at a casino, a hotel?\n\n\n\nACOSTA: We are. We're at the Red Rock Casino, sort of on the western edge of Las Vegas, out by those Red Rock canyons, which is so beautiful here in this state. And, you know, it's been one of those crowds that we -- they've been waiting outside of this ballroom for the last couple of hours to get in, and they sort of letting those crowd in about 30 minutes ago. And you can see, you know, people of all shapes and sizes coming in here, families.\n\n\n\nThere's also a good sizable crowd of Mormon supporters for Mitt Romney. That's not too surprising. And according to all of our entrance polls, 26 percent, 27 percent of these Republican voters who are casting their votes for Mitt Romney in these caucuses are from the LDS Church and some of those folks here tonight as well, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A lot of supporters of Mitt Romney out in Las Vegas tonight. A dramatic win for Mitt Romney coming on the heels of a dramatic win in Florida, earlier New Hampshire, almost in Iowa.\n\n\n\nSoledad, let's send it over to you. Big night for Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nSOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, it was. Gloria Borger, David Gergen joining me now. The victory was not a surprise. From the get- go, we knew that he was way ahead in the polls, most likely would win, and the percentage was what we're going to look for. What's the big take away then?\n\n\n\nDAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: But it's still a very significant night, and that is Mitt Romney has now won three out of five all together. He's got the last two. He's got two big battleground states in a row.\n\n\n\nAnd in looking towards the fall, Republicans want a nominee who can compete very, very well in a battleground state. There are about a dozen of them. There are a couple more coming up. There's a good chance Mitt Romney is going to win both of those. And that's going to put him in an even more commanding position.\n\n\n\nThe question has still -- is out there, though, is the turnout down significant tonight? What should we read into that? We're learning that as the night goes on.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: And there's some early indication in rural areas that it's down 20 percent, which is a huge number.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes. His unfavorables have gone up nationally. He is, you know, locked in tight races with some of these battleground states with Obama head to head. But there are some things that are changing in this in terms of he has to pay a lot of attention to. If he can win and wrap this up fairly quickly, it will allow him to pivot and do more than essentially beat up on Obama.\n\n\n\nI think he's got to present himself as a much fuller candidate. He's got to connect in ways far beyond what he's done so far. He's got to be listening and related to people who are, you know, lower income people, working people.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: So he has to shed Santorum and shed Gingrich before he can do \\that. GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, if the key point you were making is it has to be wrapped up ...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: ...and from what we've heard from Newt Gingrich's daughters and from our own reporting is that Newt Gingrich is resetting his campaign, and that's probably what we're going to hear about tonight. That we've learned he's been meeting not only with campaign donors today, but also with top staff to figure out what he does going forward.\n\n\n\nDoes he become a more positive candidate again? Remember, he started out positive, went negative, maybe positive again. And how does he proceed to talk about the Reagan legacy...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: ...which he says is what he represents?\n\n\n\nGERGEN: And one last point on this. What you can see happening as he emerges as the all but certain nominee, you can see the Obama forces and the left in general, the press in general, starting to gang up on him and they're going to try to define him.. A lot of people will gang up on Romney. He's got to be able to take that on. He can't spend all of his time worried about Santorum and Gingrich.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: As we move forward, let's talk about the next contest. Jessica Yellin is at the White House for us.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, that would be Colorado, Jessica, which, of course, is a very strong state for President Obama.\n\n\n\nJESSICA YELLIN, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It is -- or was a strong state for President Obama, Soledad. You remember he held the convention, the Democratic convention there four years ago. It was a purple state -- we always like to call it that -- that he won.\n\n\n\nBut now it's, you know, up for grabs and it will be one of those states that both men, whoever the nominee on the Republican side is, will fight to hold and it will be one of those decisive states.\n\n\n\nNow, the Obama team thinks that if they can pick up, for example, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, those states cobbled together could make up for, say, a loss in Ohio, if they have to put up with that, and still get a victory and win the White House in November. So they're looking at different alternative ways to win in November.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Jessica Yellin at the White House.\n\n\n\nYou know, the inevitability thing, if there's something that's been proven over the last maybe two, three weeks, maybe even a month, is that that does not just work.\n\n\n\nBORGER: It doesn't work. You know, it's funny, because I think when the Romney campaign started, there was this sort of air of inevitability about him. And what the people...\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Connected to electability.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Sure, it's connected to electability. But what the people in the campaign learned very quickly is that inevitability is not a campaign message. That voters actually think they ought to be able to vote and decide who's going to become the candidate.\n\n\n\nSo, inevitability in and of itself is not a message. What he has to play upon is what you just mentioned -- I'm the most electable in these swing states, look at my numbers against Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nBut, again, he's still going to have to pay some attention to Newt Gingrich and to Rick Santorum, who will both be out there criticizing him as just more Obama.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with you, Soledad. It's just been a lot of volatility and unpredictability about this and they could well continue. But think about this. A couple of weeks ago, there was a very plausible path for Newt Gingrich to the nomination. That seems less plausible tonight.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Much less.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: There is no plausible path that I can see for Ron Paul to get the nomination. It's increasingly impossible that Rick Santorum can win the nomination. So, yes, I can't see Mitt Romney losing it, but it's hard to see these other guys winning it. You know, that's why I think it becomes...\n\n\n\nBORGER: But the question is, what damage do they do to Mitt Romney along the way?\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with that totally.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Yes, that is something...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Very good point.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer has a close look inside the victory tonight.\n\n\n\nWolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A dramatic victory for Mitt Romney. We're getting ready to hear from the Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nThese folks are standing by, John. Let's go behind this dramatic win by Mitt Romney in Nevada tonight.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: And, Wolf, to David Gergen's point. Part of this is psychology. Governor Romney trying to convince the Republican electors, even those who don't love him, look, I've got this wrapped up, and look, a big win in Florida, now a big win in Nevada.\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at entrance poll in Nevada, now an exit poll. This is the way they showed up front. Who won among moderate and liberal voters? Republicans who showed up and described themselves as moderate or liberal Republicans, Governor Romney did.\n\n\n\nWho won among Republicans who showed up at the caucus describing themselves as somewhat conservative? Governor Romney did.\n\n\n\nWho won among those who described themselves as very conservative? Governor Romney did. And that's very important because that's the place he's been weaker in previous states.\n\n\n\nWhat about the big issues? You see no faces here. That's because such a small percentage said abortion was an issue or illegal immigration. The two biggest issues were the economy and the budget deficit, both of those won by Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nIf you look right here, who has the right experience? Governor Romney. Strong moral character. Voters who said that was the most important to their choice -- Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nWho is the true conservative? Here's one weak spot. Ron Paul won among a small group that said that was their number one priority. This 45 percent of the voters in the Nevada caucus said this was their number one priority.\n\n\n\nAnd again, Governor Romney winning among those who say defeating President Obama was the top priority, getting almost three out of every four votes. Speaker Gingrich, a distant second. This has been Gingrich's strength in the State of South Carolina, Wolf. The voters there thought he was more electable and that was important. Now, two states in a row have said Governor Romney and here in Nevada tonight, by a huge margin.\n\n\n\nLet's just look at one more as we come down the line here. If you look here among faith, obviously Governor Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He's a Mormon, and he won big among Mormons. He won 9 out of every 10 votes among Mormons. Congressman Paul coming in second place. But he also won those who say they have no religion, voted for Congressman Paul.\n\n\n\nBut others Christians, Mormons, Catholics, Mainline Protestants, all going for Governor Romney. This is a sweep across the electorate tonight. Some would say, well, it was a state he won in 2008, so what, who cares?\n\n\n\nBut the point, beginning February with a win and a big win, starts the process in which team Romney thinks they could run the entire month, perhaps losing in Maine to Ron Paul. The psychology is going to kick in at some point.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Gingrich says he has a delegate strategy. He's in to Tampa. That's to try to convince fundraisers, if the next few weeks are pretty tough, keep sending me money. That's a tough argument to make.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And as I said, Romney getting ready to speak to his supporters out in Las Vegas. And at some point, Newt Gingrich is going to have a news conference in Last Vegas. But I want to go to the White House right now. Jessica Yellin is standing by.\n\n\n\nJessica, you and I know, John knows, everyone in Washington knows that the Obama re-election campaign for a long time has simply assumed that Mitt Romney would get the Republican nomination. They've been fighting him for a long time.\n\n\n\nYELLIN: They have and this has been a good week for them on that front, Wolf, because Mitt Romney essentially handed them a series of campaign commercials. In a sense, he locked in the campaign message that they want to do. They want a contrast campaign, as we've been talking about, on the economy, where they can say that Mitt Romney is out of touch with regular folks.\n\n\n\nAnd by giving that interview with Soledad, no matter what the Romney campaign wants to say about taking it out of context, etcetera, it locks in this narrative that the Obama team wants to run with, that he is out of touch. And no matter what they say, they can at least replay those sound bites in a stream with, \"I like to fire people,\" and \"I'm not worth that much money\" or whatever he'd said in a campaign ad that will be played over and over. You can bet, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Jessica, stand by. We're going to be coming back to you. We're also standing by to hear from Mitt Romney. He's going to be speaking to his supporters in Las Vegas at that hotel. That's coming up fairly soon. The crowd is excited. We have projected that Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. At some point later, there will be a news conference by Newt Gingrich. We'll take that live as well. You'll hear the questions from reporters, his answers. He supposedly has a new strategy, is about to unveil tonight to try to get the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nI'll speak with Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. We're standing by for that. Also there's a special caucus under way in Las Vegas. Right now there's some surprise developments happening right now. You're looking at live pictures from this caucus. We're going to go there. You're going to want to see this. Our coverage will continue from the CNN election center right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN has made that projection. We're going to be hearing from Mitt Romney. He is getting ready to speak to supporters at this hotel in Las Vegas. Stand by for that.\n\n\n\nNewt Gingrich not the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's going to hold a news conference at some tonight. We're going to have that live. He's taking questions from reporters, supposedly will outline a new strategy going forward. I'll also be interviewing Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. Stand by for that as well.\n\n\n\nThe votes, let's take a look at the votes right now as we actually have them with 13 percent of the vote in. Mitt Romney decisively ahead of Newt Gingrich, 47 percent to 22 percent. A battle, though, under way for second place. Ron Paul, right now with 13 percent of the vote in, coming in third at 19 percent. Rick Santorum at 12 percent. But a very impressive win for Mitt Romney in Nevada right now.\n\n\n\nThere's actually a special caucus that's been taking place in Las Vegas and it's a fascinating development. Our own Paul Steinhauser is standing by with some details of this.\n\n\n\nPaul, tell us what's happening at this special caucus.\n\n\n\nPAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Wolf, this special caucus was supposed to start at the top of the hour and as you can see, no action yet. People are starting to file into the auditorium here at the Adelson Educational Complex, named after Sheldon Adelson who donated a lot of money to build this school.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing, Wolf. To take part in this caucus, you have to have to get into -- you have to sign this affidavit to get in, Wolf. And two things you have to sign, you have to say that you didn't take part earlier today in the caucuses in Clark County. They started at 9:00 a.m. local time. And you also have to say the reason you didn't take part and vote in the presidential preference poll in the earlier caucuses is because of your religious beliefs. This caucus is basically for a lot of Orthodox and other very observant Jews, Seventh Day Adventists and others who could not take part during the Sabbath until sun down was over.\n\n\n\nOK, so that's the story. Why it hasn't started yet. Still about 200 people to come in. But there was a little bit of fireworks about a half hour ago, Wolf. A guy called Evan Donahue, he says he's a delegate for Ron Paul. He says he's a volunteer for the Paul campaign out here in Nevada. He was not allowed in because, obviously, he had already voted and he was not an observant Jew or a Seventh Day Adventist. There was a scuffle and take a listen how it played out.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This building is private property. You are making me very upset, sir. I'm not going nowhere. You're not taking me anywhere. All of you folks are committing a felony. This says, conducted openly in such a manner that it's open to any registered voter. I am a registered voter, sir. I want to see what is going on in there. You are not making me leave. I am not leaving. I am not leaving. I will never leave. You will never stop me. I am here to defend democracy and I want to see what's going on.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTEINHAUSER: Well, Donahue says that the practices here by the Nevada GOP are discriminatory because to get in you have to sign this affidavit. The Nevada GOP is here, as well, obviously, the Clark County GOP, and they say, listen, this is a caucus, it's run by the party, party rules.\n\n\n\nWell, Evan Donahue is right here behind me right now. He is here. He says he's here to observe and we'll see what happens.\n\n\n\nWolf? BLITZER: So there's one thing, just to be precise, one thing to actually vote in this special caucus, it's another thing to just go in and observe what's going on. That's what this Ron Paul supporter wanted to do. He didn't vote. He already voted. He was just there to observe, is that right?\n\n\n\nSTEINHAUSER: That's what he says. But just to get into the room, you have to sign this affidavit. So, according to the Nevada, you know, the Clark County rules, he shouldn't be in the room right now because he already voted earlier in the day. A lot of other people have been turned away, Wolf, because they voted and couldn't sign this affidavit and still about 100 or 200 people out there waiting to get in, so we haven't started yet here, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We'll stay in close touch with you. Paul Steinhauser, thanks very, very much.\n\n\n\nWe're waiting to hear from Mitt Romney. He's the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's getting ready to speak to his supporters at a hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nOnce again, later, Newt Gingrich is not going to be speaking to supporters, he's going to be answering questions from reporters. He's getting ready to hold a news conference. We'll take that live, as well.\n\n\n\nI'll be speaking with Rick Santorum, another of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates. Earlier, I spoke with Ron Paul. Our special coverage will continue right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Check it out, two very different pictures over here. The Romney headquarters at a hotel in Las Vegas. Lots of supporters getting ready to hear from the winner of the Nevada caucuses. That would be Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nOver here on the right, Newt Gingrich headquarters, not a big crowd up there. No crowd at all. He's not going to give a speech. He's going to do a news conference. He's going to answer reporters' questions, supposedly getting ready to unveil a new strategy he wants to implement in the struggle to get the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nWe'll see both of those events live. We'll also speak with Rick Santorum at some point tonight. We spoke earlier with Ron Paul. In the meantime, let's check back with Soledad.\n\n\n\nSoledad, big huge night for Mitt Romney. Not necessarily so good for the other candidates, but there is still a fierce battle under way for second place in Nevada.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Yes, absolutely. I think those pictures behind you kind of say it all, don't they? The cheering Romney supporters. And then, waiting for a president, for a Newt Gingrich.\n\n\n\nLet's bring you right to the contributors.\n\n\n\nThe Mormons really delivered for Mitt Romney as we look through the entrance polls. We know that they were able to deliver. Is there anything that you can take from what we know about Mormon response, Mormon commitment to Mitt Romney that you can say and transpose to the general election?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think when you get into the general election, it becomes more -- they become your typical Republican voter, but they're also a funding source for the Romney campaign.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: OK. So, funding. Organization?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Organization will be a good thing for the Mormons. In fact, that was a selling point for Romney, although it didn't pan out for the primaries in 2008. That was one selling point a lot of people made is the way Mormons organize around the country. Those voters, young students will be able to help him. I don't know that that's true as much as hype.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: David Gergen talked a little about this sort of national polls, you see Mitt Romney going down, down, down, even though he's becoming more and more sort of the de facto candidate. And when you ask the question, can the candidate connect with -- understand the problems of America? With President Obama, the polls are like at 55 percent and Mitt Romney polling at the end of January around 39 percent. How big a problem is that?\n\n\n\nROLAND MARTIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, first of all, it's no shock his numbers will be going down because as you get deeper into a primary, his negatives naturally go up, because you have the attacks going back and forth, you have the ads, you have Newt Gingrich slinging arrows, get Rick Santorum in his speech tonight condemning, of course, the health care plan in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nSo, people begin to hear more about you. He is going to have an issue when it comes to connecting with voters. I go back to -- when he goes into Ohio and Pennsylvania and he goes into Michigan, what is he going to say to those voters? How is he going to say, oh, before when I say it, look, let the market take over when it comes to foreclosures, but you're under water. What did I say before when I say let GM go into bankruptcy, but down to automakers. He has to deal with that. Those are real blue collar workers. If he doesn't make the arguments to them, how is he going to win them over to ...\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's already having trouble connecting to the Republican base.\n\n\n\nMARTIN: So I'm saying.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And this is critical for the general election. That's why I keep saying that his win tonight really doesn't have any implications for the general elections other than negative ones I think because he's shown that he can't win the Latino vote.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to say I disagree. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me thinks he lost this primary tonight listening to you guys.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. And to Roland's point, when a voter goes into the voting booth to vote and many studies have been done about this, they vote on their gut. And right now President Obama is winning that battle of who is going to be the candidate who is going to fight for you, who understands what you're going through, and who is going to put forth policies that is going to fight for you.\n\n\n\nAnd that really, that's not just a talking point. If you look at Mitt Romney's plan, his economic plan, a tax cut for middle class families, $167. A tax cut for millionaires, $146,000. That's the reality that he's got to contend with.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: It does make it sound like he lost today, when actually not only did he win, he won by a lot.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But his percentage is lower this year than in 2008.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWILL CAIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It reinforces what Gloria talked about, David talked about. This word we've been batting around for months now of inevitability. When he's now winning tea party supporters, when he's now winning very conservative voters, it reinforces this. He is going to be the nominee. It reinforces inevitability.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer's got Rick Santorum now. Wolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let's talk to Rick Santorum, Pennsylvanian senator, the Republican presidential candidate. He's joining us right now.\n\n\n\nSenator, thanks very much for coming in. You're in Colorado. Already didn't waste any time in Nevada. I suspect when you realized you weren't going to do all that well in Nevada, that's why you got out and look ahead to Tuesday's contest in Colorado.\n\n\n\nRICK SANTORUM (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you know, we're playing the demographics, you're playing on Mitt's home court in Nevada. He spent a lot of money, a lot of time there. He's been campaigning there really for five years and organizing, you know, as has Ron Raul. I mean, those are -- these early states, these first five states, you know, there's an inherent advantage to the folks who have run before, that have spent a lot of time and money in those states.\n\n\n\nAnd now we're moving out to states where they had to play sort of catch up four years ago and didn't have the organization, didn't have the strength, didn't run the campaign commercials and didn't have the strong identity. And so we think this is an opportunity for us for this race to begin to turn and begin to come toward our direction.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Have you had the chance to call Mitt Romney and congratulate him yet?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: As a matter of fact, I just got off -- I just gave a speech here in Greeley, Colorado and did a couple of interviews and now I'm doing yours. So I really haven't had a moment to do so. And I understand he's going to speak here in a minute. So I'll try to reach him maybe after he gets off the platform.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: But you will call him? I ask the question only because Newt Gingrich has made a point of not calling him to congratulate him after he won in Florida. But you will call him to congratulate?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Look, you know, one of the things I feel very strongly about is that politics is a rough enough game that it shouldn't be personal. And that when someone has an accomplishment, if someone beats you fair and square, you pick up the phone and you give him a call and you congratulate him for his good work. And we'll see him on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You know, I can't tell you how many people, so-called experts, pundits, analysts, Senator, have said to be the reason that Rick Santorum is staying in the race is that in case Newt Gingrich were to drop out, he could then emerge as the non-Mitt Romney, the so- called real conservative and develop a real challenge to Mitt Romney. Is that the way you're thinking?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I think, eventually, as I said before, this race will come toward us. We're the candidate that provides the real best perspective of beating Barack Obama. I think that's going to become more and more evident. It's just the opposite of what people actually thought at the beginning of this race. I think it's going to become clear.\n\n\n\nLook at the latest Rasmussen Poll that has us beating Obama by a point and has Romney losing by three, Gingrich losing by eighth or nine. The more that this race goes on, the more people see that we present the best chance to win this and you get a twofer. Not only do you get the best chance to win, but you get the candidate who actually holds the values that Republicans generally speak in this country hold.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Tell us what's going to happen on Tuesday in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You know, I think, again, demographically, Colorado is not the best state for us, but I think we can do well here. I think we will do much better than we did in Nevada. I think we can do even better maybe in Minnesota, and Missouri is an interesting one, because Newt is not on the ballot and that presents an opportunity for a one- on-one match up in a state that's a pretty key swing state for Republicans, actually a must-win state for Republicans in this election cycle. So, we're optimistic that we're going to perform very, very well in all three of those states.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I'm going to let you go, but very quickly, your little daughter Bella, how is she doing?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Well, thank you so much for asking, and she is doing just great. She's almost back to -- back as good as new. I just want to thank you and everybody again. It's been a -- and what a relief and thank you for your prayers and for helping us out. It's certainly given a little more hop in my steps these last few days.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Well, give her our love, as you know. Thanks very much, Senator. We'll talk to you on the campaign trail. Rick Santorum joining us from Colorado.\n\n\n\nSoledad?\n\n\n\nSOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Gloria Borger, David Gergen, first of all, we heard from Rick Santorum just now. Ron Paul we heard from a little bit earlier. We're going to hear from Newt Gingrich. We're expecting that for long for now. Mitt Romney, though, will also be coming out to give his acceptance speech. What do we need to hear from him? What you expect to hear from him?\n\n\n\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I expect him to just turn to Barack Obama. I think that he's not going to be talking about Newt Gingrich. He's going to be talking about what a great win this was. But I think he's just going to pivot and talk about Barack Obama, how he can take it to Barack Obama, how he will be better at fixing the economy and all of the things that we've already heard we will hear repeated again.\n\n\n\nDAVID GERGEN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think Gloria is basically right. That's what he did after his New Hampshire win. That's what he did after his Florida win. I would suggest though that's not what he should do tonight. Yes, he should take it to Barack Obama and probably is going to do some of that. But it's more important now that he begin making people understand what he would do, because, you know, he's got this big economic plan. I haven't met a single person that can tell you three things that they could just reel off and say here's what Mitt Romney would do if he will president.\n\n\n\nBORGER: 59-point.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He has a 59-point plan. People don't -- you don't remember that. I can tell you when Reagan was running back in 1980, he had five things he was going to do, everybody knew what they were and he got a mandate out of it.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: He's got to work on connecting with people.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He's got to work on connecting emotionally but also there has to be -- they've got a great line about being a takeover person, somebody who can turn things around. His son did that tonight and his wife Ann has been doing that. But he has now -- will have to sort of say, I can turn things around by doing the following.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Does an improving economy make that an even trickier pivot?\n\n\n\nBORGER: It does because you have to be a little bit more nuisance to mean Republicans cannot be seen to be rooting against an economic recovery. Of course not. What Mitt Romney has said, and probably continues to say, is that Barack Obama hasn't made the recovery occur quickly enough and that it may not be sustained and if you do these 59 things, that maybe you will sustain.\n\n\n\nBut I think this is a point for all of these campaigns. We just heard from Rick Santorum. They're all now refining their message. Rick Santorum is saying, if Gingrich goes, I'm the anti-Romney candidate, and they believe that there's a base of support out there that is anti-Romney. Romney is, I can take on Obama. Newt Gingrich is, I'm the conservative in this race, I can beat...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Before we leave that -- Rick Santorum, we were talking about this, Rick Santorum. I don't think there's anybody in a race who has grown more than he has.\n\n\n\nBORGER: He has.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He's sort of -- he is a much, much more appealing candidate today than when he started and the contradiction -- you have to note the contradiction tonight, he's grown as a candidate and yet his chances of winning have gone down. And it's an interesting question. I didn't know about this Rasmussen poll, he actually has moved ahead of Obama by one point.\n\n\n\nBORGER: What's interesting about Rick Santorum is that he has attacked both Gingrich and Romney on health care, but he hasn't been personally negative or nasty.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with that.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Which he points out in every speech that he gives.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: And he's done very well in these debates because he's just pointed out the contrast. One other thing to say about Newt Gingrich is, he did not have a debate before Nevada. Debates have often given him a lot of oxygen.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Except for Florida.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Except for Florida. But he had (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nGERGEN: You know the state to watch now in terms of Santorum is Ohio. For both Gingrich and Santorum, Ohio. If they can pull out a victory there, that would be huge.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: All right. Well, let's talk about that with our contributors over here. What happens in Ohio if in fact Rick Santorum wins?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Santorum has been presenting a blue collar message, and that's the exact message that he has to present because, again, white blue collar workers have been -- they have not been breaking President Barack Obama's way. It was a difficult fight for him back in 2008. And so Santorum is playing that kind of message.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: All right. We've got Wolf -- going to go back to Wolf because Mitt Romney is going to the microphone.\n\n\n\nWolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Soledad, thanks very much. Ann Romney, the wife of Mitt Romney, is going to introduce her husband. I want all of our viewers to listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Nevada.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: Once again, I'm here to make sure that you listen to me this time and obey when I tell you, don't clap until I'm finished. Nobody listened to me last time. But I do have to give special thanks to all the people that made this happen. And by the way, the most people I need to thank are all the volunteers. So a big thank you to all of you that volunteered.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: Our Nevada coach here, Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki and Congressman Joe Hick. I want to thank Congressman Mark Amodei, our Nevada Finance Chair Mark Hutchinson and the many Nevada elected officials throughout the state who have been so crucial to our success here. We are so appreciative. And, of course, Nevada State Director Sarah Nelson, Nevada Senior Adviser Ryan Irwin, Nevada State Finance Director Cory Christianson.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: And, you know, I want to give a special shout-out to Dema Guinn. You're a first lady of Nevada from a few years ago, and she and I served together as first ladies together and she became a very good friend of mine, and she's been helpful in this effort, too, and we so miss her sweet husband, Kenny. So a shout-out to my friend, Dema, to. Thank you all.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nYou know, as I have just been observing things as I tend to do, I've noticed that Mitt has started to win in states that are so important for the general election. He won in New Hampshire. That is going to be a very important state in the general election. It's a swing state in the general. He did the same thing in Florida. That's going to be a very important state for us to win in the general. We appreciate that.\n\n\n\nBut also this state is going to be an important state in the general, and you guys -\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow that we have all of you excited and energized and volunteering, we're going to need you again next November. So we appreciate that. Maybe some of you are all waking up to figure out that our country is in trouble. We're heading in the wrong direction, and we're looking for a guy that can fix it and turn this economy around and create jobs. So we're excited to introduce the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you. Thank you, guys. Wow, what a great showing. Thank you, Nevada.\n\n\n\nYou know, this is not the first time you gave me your vote of confidence, and this time I'm going to take it to the White House.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nFour years ago, candidate Cbama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings.\n\n\n\nToday, Nevada unemployment is over 12 percent. Home values have plummeted. And Nevada's foreclosure rate is the highest in the nation. I've walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them.\n\n\n\nWell, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, a newly-elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. This week he's been trying to take a bow for 8.3 percent unemployment. Not so fast, Mr. President. This is the 36th straight month with unemployment above the red line your own administration drew. And if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.\n\n\n\nMr. President, America has also had enough of your kind of help.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE (CHEERING): Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Let me ask you -- let me ask you here a question. Did Obama care encourage businesses to hire more people?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did Dodd Frank get banks to renegotiate and make more loans?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did the National Labor Relations Board attack on Boeing in South Carolina encourage employers to expand here?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did efforts to block the domestic production of energy and the Keystone pipeline speed job creation?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: And did those billions of dollars the president sent to his green energy buddies give anyone here a job?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Mr. President, we welcome any good news on the jobs front. But it is thanks to the innovation of the American people in the private sector and not to you, Mr. President.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE (CHEERING): Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: This president's misguided policies made these tough times last longer. Earlier in the week, he spoke with a woman from Texas during an online event. She told him that her husband has been out of work for three years. President Obama said that he found that \"interesting.\"\n\n\n\nInteresting? Really? I've got a better word. Tragic. America needs a president who can fix the economy because he understands the economy, and I do, and I will.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: This president began his presidency by apologizing for America. He should now be apologizing to America. We're not going to settle - we're not going to settle for a president who tells us it could be worse.\n\n\n\nWhat defines us as Americans is our conviction that things must be better. That conviction guides this campaign. It's rallied millions of Americans to our cause, including tens of thousands of Nevadans, who gave me their support here today and I thank them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNevadans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. It's better than 15 percent real unemployment. It's better than $15 trillion in debt. It's better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years and the failed leadership of one man.\n\n\n\nOur campaign is about more than just replacing the president, however. This is really a campaign about saving the soul of America. President Obama says he wants to fundamentally transform America. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOur vision for the future could not be more different than his. President Obama will grow government and amass more trillion dollar deficits. I will not de-slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze -- I will not just freeze government share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And without raising taxes, I will finally balance the American budget.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPresident Obama's brand of capitalism sends your money to his friend's companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius of consumer markets and to the creativity of the American people.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow, like his colleagues in fat lounges, they think they know better. President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will instead make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators and for job creators and get America working again!\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, unlike the other people running for president, I know just how to do that.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIf I'm elected president, my priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow, as you know, one of the most important and personal matters of our lives is our health care. President Obama would turn the decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama Care. I will repeal Obama Care.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThe president -- just this week, President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience. I will defend religious liberty and overturn any regulation that tramples on our first freedom, our right to worship as we choose.\n\n\n\nPEOPLE CHEERING: Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense. I will insist on a military so powerful that no one in the world would ever think of challenging us. President Obama seems to believe that America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe the 21st century will be and must be an American century.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE CHEERING: Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Our mission -- our mission is to increase the freedom and opportunity of the American people and our blueprint is the constitution of the United States. We're going to build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd I will not attempt to bribe the voters with promises of new programs and new subsidies and ever increasing checks from government. If this election is a bidding war of who can promise the most benefits, then I'm not your president. You have that president today.\n\n\n\nBut if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join with us.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIf you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour and not our destiny, then I'm asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember why it was you or your ancestors who sacrificed to come to America and to overcome the challenges of life in a new country, why they came here. It was not for a free ticket, it was for freedom.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIt was not for the pursuit of government benefits, it was for the pursuit of happiness. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be bigger and better than ourselves. This election, we must fight for the America we love. We believe in America.\n\n\n\nThank you so much and God bless you all.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThank you! Thank you!\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThank you! You're the best! Thank you!\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A very happy Mitt Romney with his family, his kids, his grand kids, celebrating a big win in Nevada, the Nevada caucuses. Right now, Mitt Romney, the winner of the Nevada caucuses. An impressive win coming on the heels of the impressive win in Florida. Now on to the next three contests this coming Tuesday. That will be in Colorado and Missouri and Minnesota.\n\n\n\nWe're waiting also to hear from Newt Gingrich. He's going to be giving a speech tonight. He's going to be having a news conference. Very unusual. Not a traditional event. But then again, the former speaker of the house, not necessarily always a traditional presidential candidate. He's getting ready to outline, we believe, a new strategy going forward as a result of the setbacks he suffered in Florida, also in Nevada right now. So we're expecting to hear from Newt Gingrich very soon. He'll open up with a statement and then will take reporter's questions. We'll watch to see what Newt Gingrich has to say as we get ready for the next three big contests on Tuesday that are coming up.\n\n\n\nBut right now you just heard Mitt Romney. Didn't speak very much about Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum or Ron Paul. Didn't even mention their names. Certainly didn't even refer to them in any great measure. He's apparently already looking ahead to a presidential contest against the president of the United States. Almost all of his words were directly addressed to try to contrast where he stands on so many of these issues as opposed to the president of the United States.\n\n\n\nYou see he's shaking hands right now. One thing you'll see differently than you have in the past, you see U.S. Secret Service personnel. They are with Mitt Romney right now over the past few days. He has started getting Secret Service protection as well.\n\n\n\nSoledad, let me throw it over to you.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf, let's talk to our conservative contributors this evening. And what I want to know -- yes, the two of you, Will Cain and Erick Erickson. What do you think of the speech? To me it sounded very confident, low on specifics.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought it was good. I'll say this, he's getting better at giving speeches and he's getting better at debates. When he does things over and over, he gets better. Do you know where the hole in his game, Soledad, is?\n\n\n\nActually, you do know, because you interviewed him this week. It is on interviews. And he's been reluctant to give interviews. He's not even on Fox with Bret Baier and he's probably not going to -- he's going to be reluctant with his interview with you. Maybe he should do more interviews. The more he does things, the better he gets. Debates, speeches, do more interviews.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought it was the most energetic speech he's given. (INAUDIBLE) Yes, it wasn't heavy on specifics, but these typically aren't that heavy on specifics. It was very energized. I think he realizes where he is. He realizes he's about to be the nominee, unless we get some sort of upset coming up in February.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: As Wolf mentioned, he said he really didn't mention the other guys in the race and I think that's how he didn't mention them in his speech. There's some other people in the race and I'm better than them, too.\n\n\n\nSo those other people in the race, though, could potentially drag him down a bit. I mean, he's been trying to off load them so he can focus on moving forward and they -- I mean, we're going to hear from Newt Gingrich and he has said he's got a new strategy and his strategy is not, I'm getting out of the race.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you know, he's got a delegate number he has to reach. We talk about how he won these states. Well, he's winning delegates. And unless he gets a majority of delegates in the Republican nomination, the other guys can drag him down. They could go into a convention and perhaps someone else. He's got to clear that threshold.\n\n\n\nI suspect probably he will do it because money will dry up for the other guys. But, you know, Gingrich has. He's shaken up his campaign staff. He's got a lawyer from Georgia named Patrick Millsaps as his chief of staff now. He's rearranging his priorities. He's focused on Super Tuesday. Between he and Santorum fighting over evangelicals, that probably keeps Mitt in first, but it could still keep him from getting the delegates.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) Again, anything can happen in a campaign.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: You mean the other guys don't drop out.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Grant it. Romney has been extremely corporate. He's been very disciplined in his approach. But anything can literally happen in a campaign. We saw it in 2008 when the whole issue of Reverend Jeremiah Wright came up. That could have easily derailed the campaign of then Senator Barack Obama. He dealt with it, gave a speech and got out of it. But you never know what can happen based upon one interview, one event. It could literally change the game. That's why you don't get out. It's way too early from a delegate standpoint.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I agree with that. And to Erick's point earlier, the poor comments I don't think have actually trickled down and have the effect that I think they're going to have. And Gingrich and frankly Ron Paul can take advantage of that.\n\n\n\nAnd to your point, Will, he actually didn't win all the demographics. He lost the demographic of people who make $30,000 or less. And again, that underscores the fact that blue-color workers which he cannot win without their vote, do not see that this is a guy who will fight for them.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's a basic fact, though, nothing succeeds like success in politics and in life, OK? And he won tonight and he won big and he has momentum. The other candidates now have to prove to their funders that they should continue to give them money. And this is where the Super PAC story comes in. Because there's very little incentive for a candidate to get out of the race if he's still getting millions of dollars from a Super PAC.\n\n\n\nSo if Sheldon Adelson says to Newt Gingrich, OK, guess what, I'm going to give you $2 million so you can get up to Super Tuesday...\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: David Gergen is nodding his head, yes, yes, yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: What's the incentive for Newt Gingrich to get out? If Adelson says no, then he doesn't have the juice. He doesn't have the money.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: We've been talking all evening about the need for Mitt Romney to warm up and to reach people. He has one big asset going in that regard -- Ann Romney.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Do you think she's going to jump in and run? No.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Well, I'll tell you something. They've used her now as the warm-up act, in effect, the last couple of times, and she's terrific at it. She's warm, she's humane, she has a quality about her that I think reflects well on him, and I think they've been very smart, they're starting to put him on these events like these tonight. They're putting him in the midst of people thronging around him as opposed to being on a podium back from people with a curtain behind him. It's a much more effective -- he's had a big night. I think he still needs to work on his speeches but he's getting better.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a contrast to Newt Gingrich as well, who rarely do you see his wife introduce him.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: OK. We'll talk about Newt Gingrich because he's coming out. He says he's got the surprising new announcement, a new strategy about delegates that he's going to share with everybody.\n\n\n\nNo, no, actually I don't think he might drop out. I think it's not dropping out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Let's not lie to the people. New strategy about delegates. That's on the other side of this commercial break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\u201c@MrsPaznanski: Romney says he'll get 12 million Americans back to work but outsources jobs.

The compete transcript of her remarks in Cleveland are posted below.\n\nSPEAKER: FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. Thank you all.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. Thank you. I am -- I'm absolutely -- I'm absolutely delighted to be back in Cleveland and to be here at the Industrial Innovation Center. I've had a chance to learn about the great work you do here. I especially want to applaud Team Wendy for everything you do to protect our troops, first responders.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd others from traumatic brain injury. It is so important that we continue to support those who protect us.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\nCLINTON: Thank you all.\n\nAUDIENCE: We want Hillary!\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: It is good to be back in Cleveland, I can tell you that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want to thank -- I wan to thank your extraordinary senator, Sherrod Brown, for his leadership, for that very kind and generous introduction. You are very fortunate to -- to have him representing you. I want to thank your congresswoman, Marcia Fudge...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWho is both indomitable and indefatigable. She is such a tenacious advocate for the people she represents. I want to acknowledge the mayor, Mayor Jackson, who was here, County Executive Budish (ph). And I particularly want to recognize the passing of George Voinovich, and he devoted his life to serving the people of Ohio as mayor of Cleveland, as governor and senator. And we send our prayers and sympathy to his family.\n\nI also want to thank Dan Moore, the owner and founder of this company and Team Wendy for his belief in Cleveland, for his commitment to create jobs. I can't wait to work with him to do more of what he has accomplished here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, originally, I had intended to come to Cleveland under very different circumstances. We are heading into a general election that could be the most consequential of our lifetimes. But today is not a day for politics.\n\nOn Sunday, Americans woke up to a nightmare that's become mind numbingly familiar. Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected. A madman filled with hate, with guns in his hands, and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans, and by extension, the openness and diversity that defines our American way of life.\n\nWe will learn more about the killer in the days to come. We know that he pledged allegiance to ISIS, that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the United States, even if they are not coordinated with ISIS leadership. But there's a lot we still don't know, including what other mix of motives drove him to kill.\n\nThe more we learn about what happened, the better we'll be able to protect our people going forward. In the days ahead, we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short, many of them young people, just starting out in their lives. They were travel agents and pharmacy techs, college students and amusement park workers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and they had one thing in common. They all had a lot more to give.\n\nCLINTON: We should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them, to pray for everyone who was killed, for the wounded, those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures, for our first responders who walked into danger one more time. As a mother, I can't imagine what those families are going through.\n\nBut let's also remember the other scenes we saw on Sunday. We saw the faces of some of those first responders who rushed into danger and tried to save as many people as they could. We saw survivors like Chris Hansen who risked their lives to help others.\n\nPeople gathering outside hospitals to comfort anxious family members, waiting for news of their loved ones and waiting, too, to learn more about what they could do to make sure this never happened again.\n\nReligion leaders condemning hate and appealing for peace. People lining up to donate blood. Americans refusing to be intimidated or divided.\n\nYesterday I called Mayor Dyer of Orlando and offered my support and my appreciation for the leadership that he and the other officials have shown. This is a moment when all Americans need to stand together.\n\nNo matter how many times we endure attacks like this, the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people breaks our hearts, tears at our sense of security and makes us furious.\n\nNow we have to steal our resolve to respond. And that's what I want to talk to you about. How we respond.\n\nThe Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have no doubt -- I have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together. Whatever we learn about this killer, his motives in the days ahead, we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound.\n\nIn the Middle East, ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. They are slaughtering Muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways. They are beheading civilians, including executing LGBT people. They are murdering Americans and Europeans, enslaving, torturing and raping women and girls.\n\nIn speeches like this one, after Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, I have laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the other radical jihadist groups in the region and beyond.\n\nThe attack in Orlando makes it even more clear, we cannot contain this threat. We must defeat it. And the good news is that the coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made recent gains in the last months.\n\nSo we should keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign, accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground and pushing our partners in the region to do even more.\n\nWe also need continued American leadership to help resolve the political conflicts that fuel ISIS recruitment efforts.\n\nBut as ISIS loses actual ground in Iraq and Syria, it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can, from Afghanistan, to Libya, to Europe.\n\nThe threat is metastasizing. We saw this in Paris. And we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.\n\nCLINTON: So, yes, efforts to defeat ISIS on the battlefield must succeed. But it will take more than that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies. As president, I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will put a team together from across our government, the entire government, as well as the private sector and communities to get on top of this urgent challenge. And I will make sure our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have all the resources they need to get the job done.\n\nAs we do this, there are three areas that demand attention. First, we and our allies must work hand-in-hand to dismantle the networks that move money, and propaganda, and arms and fighters around the world.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to flow -- we have to stem the flow of jihadists from Europe and Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and then back again. The only way to do this is by working closely with our partners, strengthening our alliances, not weakening them or walking away from them.\n\nSecond, here at home, we must harden our own defenses. We have to do more to support our first responders, law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have seen firsthand how hard their job is, and how well they do it.\n\nIn Orlando, at least one police officer was shot in the head. Thankfully, his life was saved by a Kevlar helmet, something folks here at Team Wendy know a lot about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt has often been said that our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time, but terrorists only have to be right once.\n\nWhat a heavy responsibility. These men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude. And they deserve the right tools, and resources and training. Too often, state and local officials can't get access to intelligence from the federal government that would help them do their jobs.\n\nWe need to change that. We also need to work...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe also need to work with local law enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable, so-called soft targets, like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship.\n\nNow, I know a lot of Americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the FBI's radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in Orlando, and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again.\n\nWell, we have to see what the investigation uncovers. If there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent, we must do them. We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out.\n\nThat's why I have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home.\n\nEven as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: And that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things.\n\nIf the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldn't be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.\n\nAnd you shouldn't be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.\n\nAnd yes, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.\n\nNow, I know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism. Well, in Orlando and San Bernardino terrorists used assault weapons, the AR-15. And they used it to kill Americans. That was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook.\n\nWe have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war. And that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack, but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders.\n\nAnd I want you to know, I'm not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions.\n\nNow, the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by ISIS and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the United States and Europe.\n\nFor starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.\n\nWe also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online. This is something that I spend a lot of time on at the State Department.\n\nAs president, I will work with our great tech companies from Silicon Valley to Boston to step up our game. We have to a better job intercepting ISIS' communications, tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks, as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization.\n\nAnd there is more to do offline as well.\n\nCLINTON: Since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with Muslim American communities. Millions of peace-loving Muslims live, work and raise their families across America. And they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, and the best positioned to help us block it. So we should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLast year, I visited a pilot program in Minneapolis that helps parents, teachers, imams, mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before it's too late.\n\nI've also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in Los Angeles and other places. And we need more efforts like that in more cities across America. And as the director of the FBI has pointed out, we should avoid eroding trust in that community, which will only make law enforcement's job more difficult.\n\nInflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion. It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. That's wrong. And it's also dangerous. It plays right into the terrorists' hands.\n\nStill, as I have said before, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of Islam to justify slaughtering $ innocent people. They'd take us all back to the Stone Age if they could, just as they have in parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. And an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country. You have millions of allies who will always have your back.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I am one of them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFrom Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.\n\nOur open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability. It makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization. And this raises a larger point about the future of our country.\n\nAmerica is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future.\n\nCLINTON: This vision has sustained us from the beginning. The belief that, yes, we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history, that we are not a land of winners and losers, that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our God-given potential. And we have a responsibility to help others do so as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs I look at American history, I see that this has always been a country of \"we\" not \"me.\" We stand together because we are stronger together. E pluribus unum. One -- out of many, one -- has seen us through the darkest chapters of our history. Ever since 13 squabbling colonies put aside their disagreements and united because they realized they were going to rise together or fall separately, generation after generation has fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of dignity and opportunity. Ending slavery. Securing and expanding the right to vote. Throwing open the doors of education. Building the greatest middle class the world has ever seen.\n\nAnd we are stronger when more people can participate in our democracy.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we are stronger when everyone can share in the rewards of our economy and contribute to our communities, when we bridge our divides and lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. Now we have overcome a lot together and we will overcome the threats of terror and radicalization and all of our other challenges. Here in Ohio and across America, I've listened to people talk about the problems that keep you up at night.\n\nThe bonds that hold us together as communities, as one national community, are strained by an economy with too much inequality and too little upward mobility. By social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future. I have heard that, and I want you to know as your president I will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart. We're gonna get an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we're gonna forge a new sense of connection and shared responsibility to each other and our nation.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n(APPLAUSE) finally let me remind us all, I remember, I remember how it felt, on the day after 9/11, and I bet many of you do as well. Americans from all walks of life rallied together with a sense of common purpose on September the 12th and in the days and weeks and months that followed. We had each others' backs. I was a senator from New York. There was a Republican president, a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor. We did not attack each other. We worked with each other to protect our country and to rebuild our city (ph).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPresident Bush went to a Muslim community center just six days after the attacks to send a message of unity and solidarity. To anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our Muslim neighbors and fellow citizens, he said, \"That should not, and that will not, stand in America.\" It is time to get back to the spirit of those days, spirit of 9/12. Let's make sure we keep looking to the best of our country, to the best within each of us. Democratic and Republican presidents have risen to the occasion in the face of tragedy. That is what we are called to do my friends and I am so confident and optimistic that is exactly what we will do.\n\nThank you all so much.", "comment_3": "Hillary Clinton Responds To Mass Shooting In Orlando https://t.co/FnECPguzsQ", "split": "train"}

Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.\n\nWorking together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody\u2019s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.\n\nThe summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators\u2019 Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:\n\nWhat standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.\n\nHow to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.\n\nHow to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.\n\nHow to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.\n\nHow to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.\n\nHow to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.\n\nOf course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.\n\nNevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don\u2019t let this opportunity pass us by.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama", "comment_3": "1997, Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit,http://tinyurl.com/3zpqwy", "split": "train"}

Brady Press Briefing Room\n\n1:45 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. GIBBS: Good afternoon. Before we get started, let me just run through real quickly, just for your planning purposes, some events that the President will be doing in and around the meeting later this month at the United Nations General Assembly. We'll have more detail on this for you then, but I just wanted to give you just a quick sketch.\n\nThe President of course will deliver his first address to the U.N. General Assembly. Secondly, he will attend and deliver remarks at Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's climate change summit.\n\nQ Can you give us some dates?\n\nMR. GIBBS: That would be good if I had them. I don't at the moment.\n\nThird, the President will attend the Secretary General's luncheon for heads of state and host the traditional American reception for other heads of state. The President will also host a lunch for heads of states and governments from sub-Sahara Africa to discuss building a 21st century partnership to increase economic and social development.\n\nHere's one date I do have. On September 24th, the President will chair a summit-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the topic of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. This is only the fifth time in the history of the U.N. that a head of state-level Security Council summit has been convened, and the first time ever that a U.S. President will chair a U.N. Security Council summit.\n\nQ Did you ask for it?\n\nMR. GIBBS: We did ask for it, and are heading it. And then lastly, the President will host a meeting with countries that contribute the largest numbers of troops and police to U.N. peacekeeping operations. Again, more detail on this as we get a little closer to U.N., but wanted to walk --\n\nQ Can you repeat that last one?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Yes. Host a meeting with countries that contribute the largest number of troops and police to U.N. peacekeeping operations.\n\nQ Are all the heads of state invited to the reception?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't have a list of who's RSVP'd.\n\nQ Will President Ahmadinejad be invited?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I doubt it.\n\nQ Who controls the invite list?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Burton does.\n\nQ No, but I mean, is it -- (laughter) -- is it the U.S. or --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Yes, yes, this is an American reception, so yes.\n\nAll right, now back to our regularly scheduled programming. Yes, ma'am.\n\nQ Why would he be left out?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Because Iran is failing to live up to its international obligations.\n\nQ There's no other nation in the U.N. --\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, I don't -- I think there are others that might miss out on the hors d'oeuvres.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ Earlier today, Speaker Pelosi said that she sees little support in the country or in Congress for sending more troops to Afghanistan. Has the President decided what he's going to do in Afghanistan? Do her comments kind of box him in in any way?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Look, as we've discussed before, obviously the assessment that has been delivered to Central Command, to the Pentagon, and to the White House from General McChrystal is part of a rigorous assessment process that the President wanted instituted upon coming into office, and to reassess our strategy in this very important region of the world. That continues to be discussed here and at the Pentagon.\n\nAs we've also talked about, separate resource decision reports will be coming in the next few weeks, but have not been received as of yet. The President will make a decision based on what he thinks is in the best national security interest of this country.\n\nQ What is his time frame for making a decision? And when he does make a decision, how will he --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, it's hard -- again, the evaluation process is ongoing on the original assessment. We've not received yet a resource report from commanders in Afghanistan to begin to consider. So there are several different assessments that will happen prior to that, and this is an ongoing process.\n\nQ Haven't they been told not to ask for more troops?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Not in any way, shape, or form.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ Speaking of Iran, yesterday you said the administration wanted to see progress from Iran in the proposals that it submitted yesterday. Now that you've had a chance to look at them, did you see what you wanted? Also, Iran is saying that the proposals did not deal directly with its nuclear activities. Is that the case? And finally, Russia came out a little bit ago and said the U.N. Security Council would not support oil sanctions. Does this administration agree?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I have not seen the Russian comments. Let me speak more broadly about Iran and -- obviously this week's discussion at the IAEA makes further clear the concern that the international community has and the gravity that we have about Iran's illicit nuclear program. Iran has failed to address past violations, failed to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions to suspend its nuclear activity. The offer is still being evaluated by the P5-plus-1. I would say Iran's proposals have time and again failed to live up to its international obligations. And we've discussed that Iran obviously has two paths that they can choose. One of those paths leads to increased international isolation if they don't take concrete steps to end their program.\n\nAs we get closer to the U.N. and the G20, obviously there will be a period of discussion and evaluation as to where we are as we move forward together with the international community.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ The President yesterday, last night, said that the bills, the health care reform bills, whatever he signs will be deficit-neutral and will bend the cost curve. The Democratic bills that have been introduced in the House and Senate so far, at least according to the Congressional Budget Office, will not do that. They will increase the deficit, according to Doug Elmendorf, and they will not bend the cost curve. In fact, the cost curve will continue to go up. Does the White House accept what the CBO director says about these bills? And if so, what pressure is the White House conveying or using on Congress and Democrats to improve these two elements that the President said were so important to him?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, let's -- let me take these separately. First and foremost, it's not up to us to judge -- well, obviously we take at face value whatever the CBO says about legislation, as we've discussed in here. The proposal that the President outlined last night is obviously in some ways different than what we -- what has been discussed on Capitol Hill thus far. I think CBO would be one of the first to tell you that one way to bend that cost curve is to go after and discuss how to prevent what the President called Cadillac health insurance plans last night, that tend to make steeper that curve going upwards.\n\nI think one of the things that the CBO has said is addressing that will put that downward pressure on cost, and obviously the President, as part of his plan, last night outlined a fee on insurance companies that offer these Cadillac plans after -- at a certain rate. So I think that, first and foremost, is one of the things that the President outlined. And I think, secondly, the President outlined a trigger, a deficit trigger that would evaluate whether or not savings have been achieved. And if savings haven't been achieved before moving forward, how that savings can be achieved before the plan is fully implemented in 2013. I think those are two ways that the President outlined last night to address those concerns.\n\nBut, Jake, you heard him I think say pretty clearly that this was -- this has to change the direction of our -- of government spending on health care, and this has to not add a dime to the deficit. The President is very serious about keeping those promises.\n\nQ How firm is he being with Democratic leaders, because they -- I mean, we've heard from Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi that they're 90 percent there. You guys have said that there's 80 percent agreement. It seems to be that they're -- and I understand the President --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I put some of the proposal the President outlined in that sort of 10 to 20 percentage range.\n\nQ Well, is it going to be that significant? I mean, are these major steps that are actually going to change the impacts of these bills, according to the CBO announcing --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I mean, again, I think the CBO has evaluated a number of cost-cutting mechanisms that have been outlined. And the one that they think has the greatest ability is to -- deals with these Cadillac health insurance plans, which the President talked about last night.\n\nSo I do think the President believes that will have a -- will have an impact on the cost curve.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ Congressman Wilson's apology -- I don't want to dwell too much -- but how was that apology conveyed to the President?\n\nMR. GIBBS: It's my understanding that Congressman Wilson called the Chief of Staff last night -- I can check on the time in which we got an e-mail on that -- an hour or so after the conclusion of the speech, to express his apology for what he had said, and that the Chief of Staff accepted that on behalf of the President.\n\nQ Was that apology conveyed to the President this morning or --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Last night.\n\nQ Last night.\n\nMR. GIBBS: But, you know, again, the President -- to reiterate what the President said in the Cabinet meeting, we can disagree -- he's said this millions of times -- we can disagree without being disagreeable; that we can have an honest debate about our views on health care and what we think is best for the American people, but we can do so without what you saw last night. And I think it's obvious that Congressman Wilson agrees with that.\n\nQ And do you have details on this meeting with the President and centrist Democrats today in the Senate?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think we will, if we haven't already, put out a list of senators that will be there. I think there's 15 to 17 that will be there.\n\nQ What time?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think it's at 4:15 p.m. this afternoon, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nQ And what's the President's message going to be?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I think the President wants to talk through with moderate Democrats and centrist Democrats some of the proposals that he outlined last night, some of which we just talked about that have and enjoy their support, and figuring out how we can move this -- continue to move this process forward. We'll have a short readout from after the meeting, as well.\n\nQ How long do you think it will go?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think it's on the schedule for probably 30 to 45 minutes, but we'll check.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ Do you think he has satisfied the liberal Democrats? And also, what is he going to do now to keep the momentum?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I think most of you have seen that we will travel on Saturday to Minnesota to talk again -- on Saturday -- to talk again about the importance of health care reform and to keep this going. In terms of -- I think what the President outlined last night is something that can appeal to Democrats and Republicans and bring people together to solve this problem that we've been talking about for so long.\n\nI don't want to speak directly for members of Congress, but judging from many of the comments that I've seen in reporting today, I think the President did a good job of appealing across the political spectrum in outlining a proposal that -- the elements of which he thinks can represent an important step forward in health care reform.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ Senator Baucus today said that as far as he's concerned, it sounded like the President was reading his plan -- or \"our plan\" as he put it. He said, it sounds like we're in sync in openness to co-ops, $900 billion, deficit-neutral, deficit trigger. Was the President making a conscious effort to move in the direction of the Gang of Six/Baucus plan?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, look, let me -- obviously the President fully supports and has lauded the efforts of the Finance Committee to continue to work on getting a plan out of their committee. Obviously he talked about four of five committees of jurisdiction -- something that's never happened before -- have completed that work. Senator Baucus announced earlier yesterday that the committee would convene on the 21st to mark up legislation. Again, I think it's a tremendously positive and important development in continuing health care reform through the congressional process.\n\nLook, I think there's plenty of room for agreement. The President has used the figure that Jake cited as about 80 percent agreement, I think a lot of which he reiterated last night. And we certainly hope that the Finance Committee, the Gang of Six, Republicans and Democrats, will find enough to like in all these pieces of legislation and in this proposal to move something forward.\n\nQ A lot of your favorite people, the pundits, are concluding already that what the President was basically doing, by making an argument for public option but then making it so clear that he's open to either the co-op or the trigger, he's basically saying, I'm moving in the direction of Baucus and company, or the trigger, and you 100 or 80, whatever you are, liberal Democrats in the House, you're going to have to face reality here; you're not going to get what you want. Was that the President's message last night?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I mean, I -- again, without referring to my good friends, the pundits, I'd look more directly just exactly at what the President said. I think there's no doubt that the President laid down the notion that we have to have options, particularly in a private insurance or small group insurance market that, as the President noted, 75 percent of -- more than half the states are dominated by just five companies in each state. I have used the example many times of Alabama being dominated -- 89 percent of that insurance market is dominated by exactly one company; that we have to have that choice and competition. And quite frankly we've always thrived in this country with choice and competition in whatever it is.\n\nI think he reiterated that the public option is not the be-all, end-all of health care reform; that he's open to ways to achieve choice and competition and wants to work with Congress to see that happen. I think this is part of the process of bringing people together and getting a solution.\n\nQ A lot of people say what you just said is a death knell, really, for a robust public option.\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think -- I think if you watched what the President said last night, I think he's very clear on that.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ Robert, we heard the President today again say he's open to talking to anybody about any ideas. But is it fair to say that actions are speaking louder than words? Today, the President is meeting with a group of just Democrats. Saturday, he's traveling to Minneapolis, a state that has got two Democratic senators, a state that gave you the 60th U.S. Senate seat.\n\nMR. GIBBS: There's 59 U.S. Senate seats right now.\n\nQ There's 59, I understand that. But it was -- gave you the 60 at the time. Is there --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I remember Minnesota being a swing state at or around this time last year.\n\nQ I was trying to remember when that was.\n\nMR. GIBBS: It was about the time the Republican convention ended in St. Paul, Minnesota -- (laughter) -- with Tim Pawlenty as the governor.\n\nQ My point is the President talked --\n\nMR. GIBBS: At or around then. (Laughter.)\n\nQ -- the President talked a lot about Republican ideas, bipartisanship. Should we expect to see a meeting here at the White House with a group of Republicans?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Look, I presume we will have Republicans and Democrats down here to talk about this proposal. The President didn't go to Capitol Hill just to give lip service to both sides of the aisle. I don't think that you can judge one day's effort, or one afternoon's effort, the one day after the speech.\n\nThe President is focused on hearing all of those ideas. Again, as you said, he reiterated that not once, but then a second time at the Cabinet meeting today when you all were in there. I hesitate to -- again, Minnesota was a swing state for quite some time in the general election. So I don't know that I would throw Minnesota in one --\n\nQ But this is about winning votes, and a lot of times we see -- we watch Presidents when they've got initiatives that they're trying to win votes, all of a sudden they show up in states where they're trying to get -- it's obvious you have both Democratic Senate -- but, I mean -- so I'm just saying, should we not read into where you're going?\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, the state wasn't -- the state wasn't picked for who represents it in the Senate, no more than it was than who represents it at any level of government. It's a state the President hasn't been to, and looks forwards to going to going to on Saturday.\n\nQ Who was the last Republican, besides Olympia Snowe, that he's talked with about -- that he's -- the President himself has talked with about health care?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I have to go back and look at my call list.\n\nQ Was it recent?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't have the call list. I'd have to go back and look. Let me go back and look.\n\nQ And following up on Afghanistan, does the President believe there should be an exit strategy at some point?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Absolutely. I mean, I think the President -- first and foremost, I think the President has always discussed, and particularly since coming to office, that there isn't a -- there isn't a military solution alone for Afghanistan. We do not have -- we do not have the troops or the money to be there in perpetuity. I think the Secretary of Defense has been pretty clear on this, as well, that we're not there to build some utopian democracy. We have very clear goals. We are working with Congress on those benchmarks -- as the Speaker mentioned in her press availability today -- to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy al Qaeda and its extremist allies. But, no, we're -- the President does not in any way envision us being there -- being there forever.\n\nQ Should the American public expect to see the President say, okay, look, we have an exit strategy, here it is, or (inaudible) happen sooner rather than later?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think the President will continue to talk about -- I think the President will continue to talk about the objectives and the goals that he has for this policy, and underscore that, again, we don't have -- we don't have the human resources or the material resources to be there forever.\n\nQ Well, what's the strategy?\n\nMR. GIBBS: What's the strategy? Well, the President has outlined --\n\nQ To leave.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, the President and Congress are working on very strict benchmarks to measure our progress in, as I just said, dismantling, disrupting, and destroying al Qaeda.\n\nQ So how long will that take?\n\nMR. GIBBS: That's part of the current assessment that is going on. Obviously this is an effort, Helen, that started in 2001, and I think it's fair to say the President was a critic of the lack of attention and focus paid to this effort for quite some time; that he asked that the strategy be reassessed during the transition. Part of that reassessment was changing commanders on the ground. And as part of that change, we now have received General McChrystal's assessment of his first two months in Afghanistan.\n\nJonathan.\n\nQ Picking up on Chuck's line of questioning -- pre-Afghanistan. Is Democratic unity now the first objective post-speech in the legislative strategy? And what is your thinking right now about avoiding reconciliation --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, we have always discussed on any topic the notion that we want, first and foremost, Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve the problem of the magnitude that health care is. I wouldn't put one series of lawmakers above another. I think every vote in Congress is created equal. And the President would be pleased and happy to have each and every one of them.\n\nSo, again, I think there will be extensive consultation with Congress -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- about how we move forward best on this legislation.\n\nQ And can you tell us what other folks like the Chief of Staff, Jim Messina, Phil Schiliro, what their -- and actually Joe Biden -- what their roles are right now, what they might be doing today and the next couple of days?\n\nMR. GIBBS: All four of those guys spent at least an hour and a half in a Cabinet meeting today where health care was discussed extensively.\n\nCan somebody go check on the -- just have them turn it off if the static is -- but I have no doubt that they will be reaching out throughout Capitol Hill, again, to Democrats and Republicans. Nancy-Ann will be meeting with groups of lawmakers to discuss how best we move forward.\n\nQ Now, on Joe Biden, the Vice President was called on as the pivotal person at the end of the stimulus process. And I wonder what role you see the Vice President taking --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, look, obviously the Vice President brings extensive knowledge of a number of members of Congress, knowledge that the President relied on in the buildup in the days ahead of the speech, in the discussions, the policy discussions, that we had here. And he will continue to rely on his knowledge and his expertise in moving this legislation forward. I think Vice President Biden on this topic as well as many other topics plays an incredibly important and crucial role for the President and our team.\n\nQ Robert, can you elaborate beyond the one sentence in your written readout on what the President said to Prime Minister Brown about the release of the Pan Am 103 bomber?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Look, the President restated to Prime Minister Brown our opposition that was conveyed to the Scottish government prior to their decision, and the President relayed during this conversation the disappointment in the decision that had been made. He thought this was a mistake. He continues to think it was a mistake. Obviously nearly 200 Americans lost their lives in that terrorist tragedy. The President and the administration had communicated clearly to the Scottish government that we believed any release would be a mistake and that this individual should serve the remainder of their term in Scotland.\n\nQ Is the President satisfied with what Brown responded?\n\nMR. GIBBS: He is satisfied, but again underscores his opposition to and disappointment at the decision that was made.\n\nQ Did Prime Minister Brown respond differently to what he has said publicly?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I would -- we sort of have a practice not to read out what other governments have said, and I would ask you to speak with the Brits on that.\n\nQ And one more. Is there any health care event beyond Saturday coming up in the early days of next week?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me -- I have not looked that far on the schedule.\n\nLynn, do you have a --\n\nQ Just to follow up on that release situation. Later this month in New York the President is going to host a reception for the world leaders after the U.N. opening. Will Ghadafi be invited to that reception?\n\nMR. GIBBS: We will get a list of who is and who won't be invited to the party.\n\nQ Because usually all the world leaders are.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me -- having not been here for an administration's effort at the U.N. General Assembly, let me get NSC to weigh in on that.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ Of the $900 billion cost over 10 years that the President said last night, could you outline and break down the specifics to how the White House would --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't have some of that paper with me. I'll outline it in sort of broad effect. Obviously we have discussed, I think in some detail, the waste, fraud, and abuse that is prevalent in Medicare -- that strengthening the Medicare trust fund through spending health care dollars more wisely; ending the insurance company subsidies to Medicare Advantage. Obviously you have some amount of revenue from agreements with the hospitals and with the pharmaceutical industry, some of which will be used, in the pharmaceutical industry's example, to close the doughnut hole for seniors and again strengthen the Medicare program as we know it. Also some of that will be used for broader health care reform. And then obviously the fee that we talked about on insurance companies is a broad part of that, as well.\n\nQ Do you have any estimate of how much that fee --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't have that -- I don't have that with me.\n\nQ Or even the threshold that the President would like to see?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I think, again, I think that's one of the things that we'll work through and discuss with Congress as we move forward. Obviously there are --\n\nQ You haven't set a threshold.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Not that I know of yet, no.\n\nQ Robert, a couple on health care and then one on trade. How would the medical malpractice aspects that the President talked about last night work, and when are we likely to see action on that?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, as you know, the President instructed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to begin working on these projects immediately. I'll give you a couple of different examples of how some of these things might work, and as these get developed obviously we'll report on them for you.\n\nThe President introduced legislation with now Secretary of State Clinton in 2005 in the Senate that builds on very successful programs that medical systems and hospitals in areas have tried that seeks mediation over litigation in ways of solving some of these disputes.\n\nI think the President and his team will look at very closely what Congressman Bart Gordon put in the Energy and Commerce legislation, which requires prior to a suit being heard in court, prior to that litigation moving forward, a certificate of merit that is given by a board of medical professionals that certifies the validity of any litigation moving forward to cut down on unnecessary costs, and as the President said, defensive medicine that he hears about from doctors and doctors' groups.\n\nQ Does that suggest that part of this could become a part of the legislation itself? Or would -- you want to handle it entirely through the administrative process?\n\nMR. GIBBS: We -- I think --\n\nQ Open to both?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Open to both.\n\nQ Okay. And the President talked about this trigger or hinge mechanism -- if you're not saving enough, we have to hold back. Is that a must-have in the legislation?\n\nMR. GIBBS: That's a -- that is a -- it is one of the President's proposals, and I think one of the things that he'll insist on being in reform. Again, I think it underscores the promise that he made that this must -- that this must not add to the deficit. And, look, it's probably an uncomfortable moment for Democrats and Republicans when the President reminded many in that chamber that we'd watched over the past many years sometimes very popular programs added to the government's tab without being paid for, right -- $1.6 trillion for tax cuts in 2001 and 2003; several hundred billion dollars, I forget the final price tag, for Medicare Part D; wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that never went through a budget process. We have troops in two countries, and you are going through an emergency supplemental process that is not counted on the deficit. Those are three pretty broad examples of big chunks that we're now paying for that weren't paid for when we started.\n\nI think the President is determined, as we address the challenges that this country faces, that one of the challenges that we face is paying for what we want to do. And I think that's exactly what the President outlined.\n\nQ And that's only up until 2013? Or does that continue on after --\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, no, the -- I think --\n\nQ -- the 10-year window of this legislation?\n\nMR. GIBBS: The President -- the President extended that going forward. Do you have a follow-up on that?\n\nQ If it is so important to keep this deficit-neutral, why not outline specific ways of getting to the $900 billion --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, I just outlined some very specific ways that the President seeks to do it.\n\nQ But to break it down dollar -- dollar by dollar?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, we're going to work with Congress on -- it would be hard to estimate the total amount raised by the fee on Cadillac insurance plans, the fee on insurance companies, without a threshold. Obviously that's something that we're going to discuss with Democrats and Republicans alike who have come to the table at this point in the debate, understanding that this proposal can do -- can do several things, including bend that cost curve.\n\nQ So you do have some sense to be able to --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I mean, there's a broad range of different things, yes.\n\nQ Let me do the one trade thing, Robert. It's somewhat obscure, but it's pending, so I hope you have some general analysis you can give me on this.\n\nMR. GIBBS: We'll see on that.\n\nQ A union representing U.S. tiremakers won a claim against China for the surge of tire imports in the United States. The President has until the 17th of this month to either follow an International Trade Commission recommendation of three years of tariffs against China, or do something else or nothing at all. What is his approach? How is this being handled? Is he more in favor in sanctions, meaning tariffs, or some sort of negotiated mediation on this?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I am aware, but you probably will find the answer to be semi-unsatisfactory. It's obviously something that the administration was -- we didn't have an Economic Daily Briefing with the President today for some scheduling reasons, but this has been touched on in a couple of those and is being worked on with representatives from the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the NEC. And as we get closer to that deadline, we'll have more on that.\n\nQ Would a response involving tariffs be viewed by the President as protectionist or within the realm of something that is a natural response if you are a victim of surge or --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me just not get ahead of where we are on that at this moment.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ Thanks, Robert. The United States Olympic Committee is meeting today in Chicago about the city's bid to host the 2016 games. The International Olympic Committee makes its decision October 2nd in Copenhagen. Apparently it's very important for a leader to be there. Spain, Tokyo -- the leaders of Spain, Tokyo, and Brazil have committed to being there October 2nd in Copenhagen, I believe. Is the President going to go?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Not that I'm aware of, no.\n\nQ Has he --\n\nQ Really? Why not? (Laughter.)\n\nMR. GIBBS: The -- yes, I was going to -- hometown interest.\n\nQ Chicago wants to know.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me double-check on the President's schedule. Obviously I anticipate having representatives there.\n\nQ But we know that Valerie is going, okay, and there had always been a thought, I thought -- thank you for bringing it up -- (laughter) --\n\nQ No, please.\n\nQ All right. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. GIBBS: The gentleman yields his time to the gentle lady from -- representing Chicago. Yes.\n\nQ Well, as you now know, you probably made a few million ears perk up by saying that he's not coming. So if you have some explanation as to why not, that says something.\n\nMR. GIBBS: I should say -- I said that as far as the schedule I had seen, that was not planned. I will -- based on the millions of --\n\nQ Well, you don't hop over to Copenhagen. I mean, obviously --\n\nQ Is the date being held?\n\nMR. GIBBS: This is -- I will, because of those several million ears that have now since perked, check.\n\nQ Is the date being held?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me check. It's hard for me to look into my invisible crystal ball.\n\nQ If he's not -- that would -- that he might not come if it was thought the city's bid -- which has a little bumpy road back home right now -- was in trouble. So that would be very useful to get the whole picture from you.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, look, I think the last set of articles I read on where the IOC was on Olympic bids had America's bid in Chicago at the top of that list. So I don't -- without getting into Chicago politics on that, I think our bid is -- this country's bid is very well represented and seems to be making progress.\n\nAre you extending your time? (Laughter.)\n\nQ No, I'll pass.\n\nQ Well, now could this be a today thing to get back and clarify?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I will endeavor to call up the schedule when I get back to my office.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nQ Can you get back to all of us?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I was going to say, I guess these million or so ears include quite a few dozen in here.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nQ A couple of \"specifics\" questions. I noticed last night the President said 30 million or more than 30 million American citizens lack insurance and I was struck by that figure, commonly used figure -- the one the Census Bureau used today was 46 million people without insurance.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Forty-six point three, right.\n\nQ Right. So why did the President limit it to 36 million -- or 30 million citizens? Was this a way to draw a distinction between American citizens and those who are illegal immigrants and the subject of contention, or what --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Obviously this has been a point of some contention during the speech, as I recall.\n\nQ Right. So --\n\nMR. GIBBS: The legislation -- the proposal that the President outlined covers American citizens. I think he was clear for almost everyone that the legislation does not cover -- his plan would not cover illegal immigrants. If you subtract a rough estimate from that 46.3 million, you get a number that's somewhat unknown but in the 30s that represents American citizens, as the President pointed out. I would go one step further to point out that last night was not the first time that the President has talked about the fact that illegal immigrants aren't covered -- or would not be covered as part of his plan. He said that most recently in the interview -- radio interview that was done here, and said that also in the campaign in 2008.\n\nQ So in effect he's saying that a quarter or more of the people who currently lack insurance will still lack insurance once the plan is passed, is that correct?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, again, I don't know --\n\nQ -- many uninsured people in this country presumably driving up health care costs. Is that correct?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I think the President would look at -- because he's -- would look at how many American citizens are covered under our proposal, rather than looking at different numbers that don't include American citizens.\n\nQ What I'm asking, though, is it then his vision that there could still be at the end of the day as many as, say, 16 million people living in this country without health insurance who --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, I don't think it's -- the President outlined a plan that doesn't cover illegal immigrants. The number that the President seeks to cover is to provide universal access to coverage for American citizens. I think you heard the President even discuss last night that there are going to be some American citizens who decide they don't want or don't need health insurance that are also going to be living here.\n\nQ Robert, what's the reasoning behind that? Obviously some concerns among conservative Republicans about this have to do with that you're not legislating the negative here, you're not adding -- you know, passing this amendment, I guess, that they want to triple-check that there's no way illegal -- I mean, why not go along with that if that assuages --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, Chuck, I think --\n\nQ What is the legal reason --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me just give you this example. I got how many questions for how many weeks about why the President hasn't offered his views on the legislation, right? How come he hasn't introduced his plan? We did that last night. The President said in his plan it wouldn't cover illegal immigrants.\n\nQ So if it takes throwing an amendment on this, you guys are okay with that?\n\nMR. GIBBS: The President -- the legislation that the President will sign won't cover illegal immigrants.\n\nQ But in the past he has used the larger number, so then they were including illegal immigrants?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think there was just a reference to the larger number.\n\nQ But you knew that included a very large number, millions of illegal immigrants. So isn't it logical for people to assume that for a long time you were including illegal immigrants in people you want to get health insurance?\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, no more than I would assume the logic of them having listened to what he said in the campaign where it's not going to happen.\n\nQ Well, Robert, Joe Wilson this morning said -- defended his outburst by saying that illegal immigrants could still buy money on the federal exchange.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, Jonathan, let me -- let me use the example --\n\nQ Can you --\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, no, no, no. Let me -- because I stood up here and caught a lot of spears for a lot of days about where the President's plan was. It was delivered last night -- 10 minutes after 8:00 p.m., zip code 20015, the President outlined and reiterated his belief, as enunciated in the campaign in 2008, that his plan wouldn't cover illegal immigrants.\n\nQ So are you saying --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not a member of the House.\n\nQ Right, but his -- look, in his plan, would he say that an illegal immigrant could not take money out of his pocket, go on the federal exchange, and buy an insurance policy with his money?\n\nMR. GIBBS: The policy would not cover -- the plan would not cover illegal immigrants, period.\n\nQ I think the question is the House bill, for instance, 3200, explicitly says that none of the subsidies can go to people who are in this country illegally.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Right.\n\nQ Right, but some -- what some of the criticisms, and what the Congressional Research Service analysis says of it, is that people who are illegal, as John points out, are able to buy insurance, as they already do --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I can't speak for somebody that's here illegally. But I would think it would be somewhat of a bad course of events, if you're here illegally, to alert people that you are here illegally and sign up for a government program.\n\nQ Just to put the dot on that, I mean, there are illegal immigrants who are covered by emergency Medicaid all the time -- millions.\n\nMR. GIBBS: As a result of I think a 1986 law that was signed by President Reagan.\n\nQ Right. But the House bill --\n\nMR. GIBBS: The last time Congress took up immigration reform, in 1986.\n\nQ The House bill would expand Medicaid, and that could lead to expansion of emergency Medicaid that would cover, possibly --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, the proposal --\n\nQ This is what I'm asking -- so when you say that illegal immigrants will not be covered, does that mean they can't be covered by any expansion in emergency Medicaid; they can't buy into the health exchange?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Again, again, let me check with the health care guys on how this would affect the 1986 law. But they would not be covered under the health care exchange in the proposal --\n\nQ And they can't -- right, they can't -- they would be prohibited from buying insurance through the exchange?\n\nMR. GIBBS: As I understand that, yes.\n\nQ If I could just follow up. This sort of takes us to the -- another issue that the President has said he wants to address, which is immigration reform. And I wonder, would it be his vision, when he addresses immigration reform, to bring those people who are illegal immigrants into a path toward citizenship, and ultimately into a status where they could be insured?\n\nMR. GIBBS: That's -- I don't know what would be involved in, or has been involved in legislation in the past --\n\nQ May I follow up on that to clarify what you mean by an exchange, because you keep saying that you have a range of choices in an exchange, one of them being a public option, which, you know, means that if an illegal immigrant wants to get insurance and it isn't the public option, then how could there be any documentation or any way of forbidding them to do that?\n\nMR. GIBBS: You've taken your confusing question and confused me. I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.\n\nQ On the fees, the President --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Can we just -- we skip on that one, because --just -- we're skipping that one because --\n\nQ Yes, well --\n\nMR. GIBBS: You're as befuddled as I am? Fair enough. (Laughter.)\n\nQ All right, here's a simple question.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, one would presume that one was. Go ahead.\n\nQ Okay. The President talked about imposing a fee on insurers that offer high-end policies.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Right.\n\nQ But he used to talk about being open to a tax. And Baucus's plan calls for a tax on high-end insurance policies. So why is he backing off of that?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think the proposal that the President outlined last night is very analogous to what Senator Baucus apparently has in his plan and what Senator Kerry has offered or -- I think what Senator Kerry devised -- first devised this idea.\n\nQ It might be slightly analogous, but it doesn't change the (inaudible).\n\nMR. GIBBS: Ask an insurance company whether their fee or whatever you call it is -- it's the same thing.\n\nQ Robert, on the 9/11 anniversary, A, I know we've talked about some of this before. I'm interested in whatever preview you could give us on the President's remarks.\n\nAnd also -- I know we've also talked about this before -- has the President, since taking office, made a conscious effort to tone down some of the \"war on terror\" rhetoric that we have heard over the years of the Bush administration and specifically on 9/11 anniversaries?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, look, I mean, remember -- well, let me just outline again what the President is going to do. The President will visit with families at the memorial at the Pentagon and speak there. I think we just announced that Vice President Biden and his wife will visit New York and take part in that official ceremony. I think, if I'm not mistaken, that's the first time either a President or a Vice President -- sitting President or Vice President has taken part of the official ceremony. And I would --\n\nQ In New York?\n\nMR. GIBBS: The official ceremony. I think that's the case. But I certainly will ask the Vice President to go back and --\n\nQ The ceremony on the fifth anniversary, George Bush was President --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I'll get back to you. Look, this was -- I'm not sure exactly what you were trying to get at in your question. I think the President -- I mean, I think if you look at how the President observed this last year as a candidate for the presidency with his Republican competitor for the same office, there was a conscious effort on both sides, I think, quite frankly, to remove the politics of 9/11 and instead remember the sacrifice that so many made, the tragedy that was involved, and do it in a way that removed political labels from such an important day.\n\nI don't know if that answers that part of your question.\n\nQ Well, let me ask it this way. President Bush used to say repeatedly, \"America is a nation at war.\" He did so on 9/11, but other occasions during the year. My impression is that since taking office, President Obama has purposely tried to turn down the heat on the rhetoric.\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, look, I think we've certainly cut down on the use of the phrase, but, again, our focus is on getting the policy right. I don't -- I think the President spends part of each of his day in meetings about and thinking about the men and women that we have in Iraq and Afghanistan and that are through -- stationed throughout the world to protect our freedom and to address Islamic extremism. And that takes up part of his day and is something that -- the sacrifice which he's thankful for and I think all of us are thankful for each and every day. Regardless of how it's phrased, he's mindful of the effort of so many on our behalf.\n\nSavannah.\n\nQ Just to clear this up, are you saying that the President's plan, in contrast to what Democratic plans are right now, would expressly prohibit illegal immigrants from buying private insurance on this exchange?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me double-check. That's my impression, yes.\n\nQ Okay. We all know that the House bill even says you can't subsidize -- no government subsidies for illegal immigrants --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Let me -- I will double-check --\n\nQ -- but on a free market --\n\nMR. GIBBS: -- again, this is not something that -- I think the President was pretty clear on not covering illegal immigrants.\n\nYes, Margaret.\n\nQ Thank you. But illegal immigrants would still, if they were grievously injured and wandered into a hospital, be able to receive the same emergency care that they do now -- it's a basic human right, right? I mean --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't know whether -- I don't know whether the legislation envisioned changes, as I said, to the 1986 immigration law that went through Congress and was signed by then-President Reagan.\n\nQ What I wanted to ask is, when you're going back to check with your health experts, have you guys -- and I think this follows on Sheryl's question -- been able to --\n\nMR. GIBBS: She asked like eight. (Laughter.)\n\nQ And they were all excellent.\n\nQ They were great, right. But it's sort of a Catch-22, right, because there's the political reality that the country probably wouldn't support including illegal immigrants in a comprehensive care bill, but then there's the reality of the way we treat people in this country, which is if you're injured and you to a hospital you'll get the care. So --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, I think I'd go back and point you to the President's interview -- the President's interview where he last talked about this.\n\nQ Can you achieve true cost savings, sufficient cost savings, to repair the system and bend the cost curve if you still treat illegal immigrants through emergency care, because you can't do it the other way?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Well, certainly the President believes so. I mean, if you're taking some untold number out of 46 and reducing it by -- well, quite frankly, more than that. I think the latest -- I do not have the latest number handy on an estimate for illegal immigrants is what, 10 to 11 million, minus 46.3 million is 36 to 35.3 million. So you're reducing by -- again, I'm in politics, that's why I'm not so good at math -- three-quarters, or -- between two-thirds and three-quarters.\n\nQ But those 10 million hanging out there are not going to mess up the equation?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I think the President believes that through a series of proposals that he's outlined, we can achieve significant cost savings and bend that cost curve.\n\nQ Robert, the President during the campaign talked about surmounting old divisions, following back on some of the polarization in the country. Given the outburst we saw on the floor of the House last night, and given some of the anger we saw at the town hall meetings over the summer, is that project still alive? Is that feasible, to try to ratchet down that temperature?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Sure. Quite frankly, I think that's what Congressman Wilson did around 10:45 p.m. last night. I think -- look, the President I think said this today, that we all make mistakes. Sometimes we all let our emotions get the better of us. But I think the President outlined a series of ideas last night, many of which Republicans have talked about. We talked about one today, medical malpractice reform. It might not be everything that everybody wants, but I did notice a number of people on that side of the chamber stand up and applaud.\n\nI have seen remarks from Republicans throughout the political spectrum, discuss the need to get something done this year. We always take them at their word on that. We're working with Democrats and Republicans to get something done, and I think there's a genuine chance to see reform this year.\n\nApril.\n\nQ Robert, a follow-up somewhat to that. Understanding that the Republican Party and even this White House -- some people in this White House want to see this liar comment story go away --\n\nMR. GIBBS: See the what?\n\nQ The liar comment story go away --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't think it -- well, go ahead. No, no, no.\n\nQ Go ahead, finish what you have to say. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. GIBBS: It's like I'm -- no, I'm not going to say that. I think the story largely goes away, April, because the Congressman admitted a mistake, called the Chief of Staff to apologize, and the President today accepted publicly that apology.\n\nQ That's the point. The White House --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I knew it. (Laughter.) Go ahead.\n\nQ Either way, there's a large segment of this country that's still very upset with the fact that decorum was breached -- and other issues, at the very least -- and they want this man to either step down, resign, what have you -- something to happen to him. And with this apology being accepted, it's still not going away. What do you say to that segment of America that still wants something -- some type of punishment? Even people are asking for a public apology since he made a public declaration of the word in the well of the House. People are wanting a public apology from this man.\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't think -- I'm not here, and I don't think anybody in this building or anybody, quite frankly, on Capitol Hill is here to absolve what was said. We take Congressman Wilson at his word that he apologizes for an outburst that he regrets. That was the message that was communicated to the Chief of Staff last night.\n\nThe President strongly believes, though, that if we are going to deal with many of the big problems in our country that for years and years and years have not been settled -- partly because we get into these very convenient, often Washington games, where seeking a solution takes a backseat to political points being scored and name-calling and what have you -- the President is determined to break that cycle. The President is determined to seek solutions for, and get solutions passed, for those problems.\n\nI think millions of Americans would rather see their President and their Congress -- all of their Congress -- focus on providing that security and stability for those that have insurance, and providing a route to accessible and affordable coverage for those who don't, rather than debating the back-and-forth of the apology.\n\nQ Robert, could I just follow on that, please? There seems to be a bigger -- I think there is a bigger issue here, which a lot of people see, following on April's question, which is, one, the decorum of the House, and the other is the respect for the presidency of the United States, no matter who it is. Senator Specter and Whip James Clyburn both this morning said that if you just let him get away with making the phone call to Rahm Emanuel, you're just encouraging other people to do the same thing. So don't you need something like a public apology or a reprimand to make sure that --\n\nMR. GIBBS: Without having talked to -- I bet if you talked to the press secretary of that congressman today, I would not think that he's gone unpunished. My sense is that phone rang off the hook for quite some time.\n\nQ Doesn't it encourage the same kind of behavior for other people towards Presidents, no matter who it is?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I doubt anybody wants to do that and stand up and publicly apologize. I don't think that's what people want to do.\n\nGeorge.\n\nQ Robert, two weeks ago you said the President was willing to go to the moon if necessary to get health care reform --\n\nMR. GIBBS: I will check on that, and about Copenhagen, as well. (Laughter.) Could be on the way. (Laughter.)\n\nQ House Republicans have been waiting since May, trying to get a meeting with the President. Are they somehow in an orbit beyond the moon? Or why no -- why hasn't he responded?\n\nMR. GIBBS: Tempting to answer that in certainly different ways. (Laughter.)\n\nNo, the President -- I mentioned that the President would meet with many groups and many different leaders. And I believe that that includes Senate Republicans; he's talked to them. It includes House Republicans -- again, many of which I think have constructive ideas and want to see this process move forward.\n\nQ So you don't rule out that he'll accept a meeting with House Republicans?\n\nMR. GIBBS: No, not all. I mean, you know, again, we -- look, the President went to Capitol Hill four hours after the House Republican Caucus announced its opposition to the recovery plan in order to go up there to talk to House Republicans -- whose leadership had just said, we oppose your plan -- to try to get them to support the plan.\n\nI don't doubt that the President will have a similar effort on this legislation, as well.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ Who will be the ultimate arbiter of whether the health care legislation that comes before the President's desk increases the budget deficit? Will it be the OMB? Will it be the CBO, another entity? Who do you perceive being the arbiter on that?\n\nMR. GIBBS: I don't know that it's been designated, but obviously CBO is by law charged with letting you and America and, more importantly, Congress know how much legislation is going to cost.

He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who don\u2019t assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:\n\nThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that\u2019s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what\u2026These are people who pay no income tax.\n\nRomney went on: \u201c[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d\n\nMother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser\u2014where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public\u2014and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and we\u2019ve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.]\n\nHere is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:\n\nAt the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, \u201cHad he been born of Mexican parents, I\u2019d have a better shot of winning this.\u201d Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, \u201cI have inherited nothing.\u201d He remarked, \u201cThere is a perception, \u2018Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.\u2019 Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.\u201d\n\nRomney told the contributors that \u201cwomen are open to supporting me,\u201d but that \u201cwe are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we\u2019re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\u201d When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, \u201cFrankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.\u201d He added, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m either tied or close to the president\u2026that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\nAsked why he wouldn\u2019t go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:\n\nWe speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you\u2014the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side\u2014they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, \u201cDo you think Barack Obama is a failure?\u201d they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, \u201cAre you disappointed that his policies haven\u2019t worked?\u201d they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don\u2019t want to be told that they were wrong, that he\u2019s a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he\u2019s corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn\u2019t up to the task. They love the phrase that he\u2019s \u201cover his head.\u201d But if we\u2019re\u2014but we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don\u2019t agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he\u2019d keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn\u2019t been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can\u2019t get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won\u2019t graduate from high school. What\u2019re they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d What he\u2019s going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who\u2019s been successful, or who\u2019s, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.\n\n(Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.)\n\nTo assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n\nI have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didn\u2019t realize it. These guys in the US\u2014the Karl Rove equivalents\u2014they do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I\u2019d tell them to you, but I\u2019d have to shoot you.\n\nWhen one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasn\u2019t attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:\n\nWell, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact\u2026My dad used to say, \u201cBeing right early is not good in politics.\u201d And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject\u2014discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn\u2019t win elections. And there are, there are, there are\u2014for instance, this president won because of \u201chope and change.\u201d\n\nRomney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:\n\nThey\u2019ll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I\u2019m going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president\u2019s going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets you\u2019re talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. We\u2019ll see capital come back and we\u2019ll see\u2014without actually doing anything\u2014we\u2019ll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I don\u2019t know what will happen. I can\u2014I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a \u201cTaxageddon,\u201d as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that can\u2019t work together, it\u2019s\u2014it really is frightening.\n\nAdvertise on MotherJones.com\n\nAt the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney \u201csparingly\u2026so that people don\u2019t get tired of her.\u201d And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance \u201chas the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.\u201d\n\nHere was Romney raw and unplugged\u2014sort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don\u2019t contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.\n\nALSO READ: More from the secret Romney video. (Romney tells his donors he doesn\u2019t believe in a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that resolving this conflict is \u201calmost unthinkable,\u201d and that he would merely \u201ckick the ball down the field.\u201d)\n\nVideo production: James West, Adam Serwer, Dana Liebelson, and Erika Eichelberger\n\nResearch assistance: James Carter\n\nThis story originally contained versions of the videos that were blurred out.

I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week, the Gang of 20. At the big summit in Seoul, U.S. economic policies come under fire from China and Germany. Are America's woes putting its global leadership in question?\n\nOBAMA: A whole host of other countries are doing very well. Naturally, they are going to be more assertive.\n\nAMANPOUR: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham debate America's role in the world.\n\nThen, American austerity.\n\nBOWLES: The path we're on today is not sustainable. We are headed for disaster.\n\nAMANPOUR: Two members of the president's deficit commission, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and Honeywell International Chairman and CEO David Cote share some sobering views on tough economic choices the United States faces.\n\nAnd the coming showdown over tax cuts.\n\nBOEHNER: Making these permanent will be the most important thing we could do to help create jobs in the country.\n\nAMANPOUR: That and all the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnd the Sunday funnies.\n\nFALLON: China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, \"That hasn't happened already?\"\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: And hello again.\n\nBy the time Air Force One lands in Washington this evening, it will have flown around the world, a world that is fast changing, as the president found out during his 10-day trip to Asia. ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs.\n\nOBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy.\n\nTAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs.\n\nA cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali.\n\n(on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy.\n\nOBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.\n\nTAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs.\n\nFailing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency.\n\nAnd failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation.\n\nOBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world.\n\nTAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy.\n\nOBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy.\n\nTAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit.\n\nBOWLES: This debt is like a cancer that will truly destroy this country from within.\n\nTAPPER: Ones attacked by liberals and conservative, showing how difficult reducing the deficit will be. Modesty was forced upon the president in this trip full of complications.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Jake Tapper, ABC News, traveling with the president.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: And to discuss all of this, we're joined now by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He's just come back from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThank you both for joining us. And let me ask you first, Secretary Albright, because you have been to many of these summits, isn't it extraordinary that the president, that U.S. leadership is being questioned so openly, not just by China, but by Germany, who called the Fed's action, for instance, \"clueless\"?\n\nALBRIGHT: Actually not. I mean, I think -- I've been to lots of meetings, and they are discussions. And I think the thing that people have to remember is that the G-20 was not set up to solve the world's economic problems. It was, it fact, set up as a way to bring the developing countries in to show what the various disagreements can be and to come to various consensus agreements.\n\nAnd it takes a while. I think as the president said, it's an incremental thing.\n\nAnd I don't know. Christiane, I was asked by the Obama administration during the transition to meet with the G-20 when they were here, and I met with everybody individually, and you could see the fact that they all have their own interests. And it is a matter of listening to the various ideas. I think that it is a process, and I think it's very clear that America continues to be central to the process.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Graham. Certainly China and Germany, as you heard, did question America's global leadership. Do you think that is, if not actually, at least symbolically and psychologically damaging for the United States?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I don't want to overreact here. The currency issue was disappointing to me. Clearly, China does manipulate the value of the yuan to get an advantage in exports. They already have enough advantages. I was disappointed with the other nations who would not get behind President Obama to push the Chinese to change their currency policy.\n\nBut, yeah, you know, at the end of the day, we're getting criticism. Does that mean we're losing influence? Not necessarily so.\n\nBut on the currency front and trade front, this was a disappointing meetings. We need a trade agreement with Korea. We need to fight back against China currency manipulation. And I think you're going to see the Congress get more involved on the currency front after this trip.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, certainly the U.S. also being accused of trying to push down and weaken its own currency. You know, you say that this is perhaps just a sort of temporary statement by these countries, but doesn't -- doesn't America have to get its economic house in order, in order to be able to lead on a whole number of other issues, Senator?\n\nGRAHAM: Yes, I think Secretary Clinton -- I think Secretary Clinton got it right that our looming deficit is a national security problem for us, and the only way you can get America's financial house in order is do a bipartisan agreement on entitlement reform.\n\nEarmark's important. That's just on the margins. But if you really want to get America back in business, we've got to come to grips with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and find bipartisan agreements to reform entitlements before it's too late.\n\nWe're an aging population. A lot of baby boomers are going to retire. We've got fewer workers, and we need to do that sooner rather than later.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we're going to discuss this later on, but do you think there will be compromise?\n\nGRAHAM: There must be. Look what happened with health care when you tried to jam it through on a party-line vote. We need to get Social Security stabilized before it goes into permanent bankruptcy. We're going to have to increase the age. We're going to have to manipulate benefits for upper-income Americans. We've got to put everything on the table, including stable revenues. And I'd like to see this commission help lead the Congress to get some results that have been kicked down the road for far too long.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK. Let me bring up now some of the key foreign policy issues that go to the heart of American prestige and for the president's prestige, the START Treaty, the New START Treaty. Do you think that it will be ratified coming in this lame-duck session?\n\nALBRIGHT: I think it's very important that it be ratified. The president has said it's a priority issue during the lame-duck session. He just finished a meeting with President Medvedev when they were in Japan, and the president restated that it was a priority issue.\n\nAnd the reason it is, is that it's -- first of all, it's a good treaty. But part of the problem is we remember President Reagan said trust, but verify. And what has happened is that the verification procedures have now not been in place for almost a year, so we need that treaty for that.\n\nPlus, I think that we really do -- the relationship with the Russians is very important. They've been very helpful on Iran. And I think -- I hope very, very much that the lame-duck session recognizes the importance of the treaty.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Senator Graham, Senator Kerry has already said that he believes it can happen in December. President Obama said it must happen in the lame-duck session. Do you believe that it will be voted on and ratified in the lame-duck session?\n\nGRAHAM: I don't know. I'm very open-minded about the treaty. As Secretary Albright indicated, it's an important relationship between the United States and Russia. I think Russia could do more, but they have been more helpful.\n\nYou've got two impediments. Modernization. Not only do we need a START Treaty; we need to modernize our nuclear force, the weapons that are left, to make sure they continue to be a deterrent. And we need to make sure that we can employ -- deploy missile defense systems that are apart from START.\n\nSo you've got two stumbling blocks, the modernization program and how missile defense works apart from the treaty.\n\nAMANPOUR: Will you vote for it?\n\nGRAHAM: Jon Kyl is -- in its current condition, no, but Jon Kyl is working with the administration to get better modernization to make sure that missile defense is not connected to START. If you could get those two things together, I would vote for the treaty.\n\nI'd rather have a treaty than not have a treaty, but modernization and missile defense have to be better dealt with before we get there.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about some news today. You've just come back from Afghanistan and Iraq with a congressional delegation. And there's a story in the Washington Post about how President Karzai seems to be at odds fundamentally with U.S. policy there. Did that come up at all in your conversations with him?\n\nGRAHAM: You know, Christiane, I'm just stunned. We had a great meeting. We had dinner with Senator McCain, Lieberman, myself, Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry with President Karzai. The focus of the article is the night raids.\n\nWe were briefed by our military commanders that the night raids are -- we own the night (ph) militarily, are making huge impact on the Taliban, the insurgency as a whole, and we're having Afghan partners. This didn't come up at all.\n\nWe talked about, quite frankly, looking long term with Afghanistan about having two air bases in a permanent fashion in Afghanistan to provide stability, so at the end of the day, there was no discussion about a difference between Petraeus and Karzai, in terms of strategy.\n\nAnd I would just add this: If we cannot use night raids with our Afghan partners, then that's a big loss in terms of gaining security.\n\nThe Petraeus plan, the Petraeus strategy must be allowed to go forward for us to be successful. The security gains are -- are obvious. We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction, and to take the night raids off the table would be a disaster.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you quickly and briefly on this issue of Afghanistan, also. Was President Karzai -- or, rather, do you believe that the U.S. troops will stay in significant numbers post the summer 2011 deadline?\n\nGRAHAM: Yes, I do. I think in summer of 2011, we can bring some troops home, but we're going to need a substantial number of troops in Afghanistan past that.\n\n2014 is the right date to talk about. That's when Karzai suggests that Afghans will be in the lead, and I'm very pleased to hear President Obama talk about 2014.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is winning, having the ability to stabilize Afghanistan and be a good partner with the United States forever. That means we're going to need military force for quite a while. Post-2014, when the Afghans hopefully get in the lead, it will be great to have a couple of air bases there in perpetuity to help the Afghans to send the right signal to the regions, but none of this is possible unless you have a reliable partner in the Afghan government, so they need to do more quickly on corruption.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think, Secretary Albright, that the president is going to move beyond this deadline? I know it's always condition-based, but the acceptance now is it is going to be significant troops for much longer than next summer.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, they are definitely doing a review, as we -- they've begun it as we speak, and they are going to do a review again, a larger one in December.\n\nI think that the president has said that we're not just going to abandon, that we're in a transition strategy, not an exit strategy, and that it's going to be very important for there to be training of the Afghan police forces and the military forces.\n\nAnd part of the issue, in reading what President Karzai said, is that he keeps saying he wants to take over, but part of the business here is they have to be trained properly and the NATO -- there's going to be a NATO summit, and one of the things they're going to be talking about is how to do this transition policy. And President Obama and Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have said that this is going to be conditions-based.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you a broader question, Secretary Albright, on American engagement. Now that you've got the Republicans in control of Congress, you've got the Tea Party influence, do you think America will keep engaging and keep its leadership roles in so many of these areas? Or will there be a period of turning inwards, whether it's protectionism or in any other foreign policy?\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, I certainly hope not. And President Obama spoke about the problem of protectionism and the fact that we do have to be engaged internationally.\n\nEvery single problem that we are looking at -- whether it's fighting terrorism or dealing with a broken nuclear nonproliferation system or the climate change and energy issues or the gap between the rich and the poor -- requires American leadership, but it also requires being engaged in partners.\n\nAnd so I hope very much -- we don't know what the Tea Party's foreign policy is. And I think that Senator Graham has stated very clearly what the role of the Republicans is in looking at it.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think -- because you've been quoted, Senator Graham, just recently -- that there are two wings now of the Republican Party when it comes to foreign policy, that you will look inwards or outwards. And I also want to ask you about your trip to Iraq.\n\nGRAHAM: Well, let me tell you, I think -- I'm in the wing that wants to look outward and have effective engagements throughout the world, so that's why I'm glad to see that President Obama is backing off this idea we're going to leave in 2011 and talk about 2014 and make everything conditions-based.\n\nYou know, I worry that we're going to fumble the ball in Iraq. President -- Mr. Allawi, the biggest vote-getter in the recent elections, who is a Shia who married up with Sunnis to give a different vision for -- for Iraq, has said that this the new government is a joke. If he feels that, that's disappointing.\n\nIt's very important we get a government formed in Iraq that's inclusive, that represents the results of the Iraqi election, and that is a reliable partner with the United States and the region.\n\nSo I've got concerns about this new government. But we need to stay involved -- effectively involved. And I'm in the camp of the Republican Party that wants to work with President Obama to end it well in Iraq, to get it right in Afghanistan, contain Iran through effective sanctions.\n\nAnd to my friends in the Republican Party who want to withdraw, you do so at your own peril, but the administration has to do their part. They're not being as effective as I think they can be in Iraq and Afghanistan. And when it comes to Iran, our sanctions efforts are not working as well as I would like, so I'd ask them to step up their game, as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Secretary Albright, do you think Iraq is -- I mean, you just heard Senator Graham saying he's worried that it's not inclusive and it's not reliable, this -- this new government.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, it's a work in progress. I mean, there's no question about that. And every day brings a somewhat different story.\n\nI -- I do think that the American government is very involved. Vice President Biden has been talking to them, as have our ambassadors, in a variety of places, so I do think that it is a difficult process. We do need Iraq...\n\nAMANPOUR: The Sunnis just walked out.\n\nALBRIGHT: Well, no, they came back.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right, but...\n\nALBRIGHT: But I think that we are going to be watching this, but they understand that we will be there, and I agree that we need to make sure that the place works.\n\nI think that the administration is committed to that, and it is committed, also, to making Afghanistan work. I think the issue is -- as Senator Graham said, winning, I don't know what that means at the moment, but I do think that we need to have stability in both those countries, and I see the administration as looking outward. We are the strongest country in the world, and we do need partners, and that is what diplomacy's about.\n\nAMANPOUR: Discussion to be continued. Secretary Albright, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nAnd, Senator Graham, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us this morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: And as we've heard, America's growing debt is having an impact on the international stage. The draft recommendations released by the co-chairs of the president's deficit commission add up to nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020.\n\nBut the proposed spending cuts -- Social Security and Medicare cuts -- and tax increases are getting a chilly reception from Democrats and Republicans, a sure sign of the difficult task ahead, while deep spending cuts in Europe are bringing people to the streets in protest.\n\nTwo members of the commission appointed by President Obama are with us this morning: David Cote, chairman and CEO of Honeywell and Democratic Senator Kent Conrad.\n\nThank you both for coming. Welcome to both of you. You were just on President Obama's trip abroad. How does this deficit and the big troubles and problems ahead with this play in trying to gin up business abroad, jobs?\n\nCOTE: Well, I think everything ends up being interconnected. You certainly, in my view, want increased trade. Trade, I'm -- you might expect I believe is a good thing, and it benefits both sides, and you want to have countries arguing about commercial issues, not geographic issues. I think it makes a lot of sense.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, Americans are worried that their jobs are going overseas. You've said that it can't be seen as a zero-sum game.\n\nCOTE: Well, that's one of my issues. And, quite honestly, I think the media helps to perpetuate this, is that economics is viewed as a zero-sum game, my loss is your gain, my gain is your loss.\n\nAnd the only reason you do things economically is because both sides win. When you go to the store and you buy something, the store's happy, you're happy. You both benefit. And that seems to get lost when we start talking about economics on a grander scale.\n\nAMANPOUR: Senator Conrad, there has been so much talk now about the recommendations by the co-chairs of the -- of the -- of the deficit commission, the fiscal commission. Is there any area you think that there's going to be any compromise on this? I mean, they're attacking and talking about really sacrosanct parts of the American political sphere here.\n\nCONRAD: You know, a certain amount of this is shock therapy. You know, there are different options. And, of course, what everybody has fashioned -- fastened on are the most extreme of the options.\n\nBut, look, the important thing for people to know is we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. That's utterly unsustainable; it can't continue much longer, so it's got to be dealt with.\n\nIf you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation.\n\nIt's critically important we do or we will become a second-rate economic power. That is the hard reality.\n\nAMANPOUR: But in terms of things like mortgage interest and all those things that the panel is recommending, these are things that Americans have really relied on forever, just about, and so many of them. Is that even a starter?\n\nCONRAD: Well, there is -- as I referenced earlier, there is one proposal that eliminates all the tax preferences, all the tax deductions, all the tax exclusions, and uses 90 percent of the revenue to reduce rates, only 10 percent to reduce the deficit. I don't favor that approach.\n\nI think we need something that represents a continuation of the mortgage deduction, although reformed, to apply only to primary residences, for example, but we need to continue the child credit, we need to continue the earned income tax credit.\n\nBut fundamentally, if we're going to raise revenue, I don't think the way to do it is to raise rates. I think the way to do it is to eliminate some of the loopholes that exist in the system. We have a tax system now that is just loaded -- chockablock full of preferences, loopholes. We're allowing $100 billion a year to be lost to offshore tax havens, another $50 billion to abuse of tax shelters. That can't be allowed to continue.\n\nAMANPOUR: And on another -- well, on the same issue, but Paul Krugman, the economist, Nobel Prize-winner, who's going to be on our roundtable, has written this week that it really is basically tax breaks again for the rich and more onus on the -- on the middle class dressed up as something new.\n\nCOTE: Well, in my view, democracy seems to be uniquely suited to putting a traffic light up after the fourth accident. Now, we can't wait for the fourth accident here.\n\nAnd that's why I applaud Senator Conrad, for Senator Graham, when -- his comments, trying to get out in front of something, because it's too easy for the demagogues and the polemicists to respond to something, just kind of go into their neutral corner and screaming, as opposed to saying there's a time to pull together.\n\nThis is one of those times. There are times when we should pull apart and pluralism and all that good stuff where people argue their point of view, but there are times when we have to pull together, and this is one of those times.\n\nAnd it scares me that as a financially conversant CEO, I didn't know how bad this was going to get in the next 10 years. I could see where it was today, but I couldn't see what was going to happen in the next 10 years, because people want to point to stuff like Obamacare, stimulus, Bush tax cuts. And the thing that everybody misses is it's my generation, the baby boomers, who are going to flow through Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. It's going to crush the system.\n\nAnd I think the American public is ready for this discussion, but I don't see anybody having that discussion with them, and that needs to happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, are the Democrats going to allow these cuts that have been suggested in Social Security, Medicare?\n\nCONRAD: Well, I'm a Democrat...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well?\n\nCONRAD: ... and I'm saying to my colleagues...\n\nAMANPOUR: And the liberal wing of the party?\n\nCONRAD: ... it is absolutely imperative that we take this on for the country's sake. And are we going to have to make some changes to Social Security? Certainly we are. Social Security is going to go cash negative in five years. It's going to go broke in 2037.\n\nMedicare, we've just extended the life of it by the health care reform package, which has gotten almost no attention, but still it's prepared to go permanently cash negative in just 10 years. So, obviously, those things have to be reformed; there have to be some changes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me talk about the international implications of the currency wars that we were just talking about that came up during the Seoul trip. Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, has said that America's pursuing a policy of weakening its currency, and this is what the current treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, said in response to that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGEITHNER: I have enormous respect for Alan Greenspan, of course, had the privilege of working with him for a long period of years, but that's not an accurate description of either the Federal Reserve's policies or our policy. We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gaining competitive advantage or to grow our economy. It's not an effective strategy for any country, certainly not for the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, how do you assess, first, what the QE2 is, which is what he's talking about, quantitative easing? And isn't that viewed as -- certainly overseas -- as an attempt to weaken the currency, just as they're accusing China of doing?\n\nCOTE: Well, I would say managing currency is beyond my pay grade, so I don't normally get into that one. But I would say, in my view...\n\nAMANPOUR: But the affects thereof in business is your pay grade.\n\nCOTE: But I would say -- well, I was one of the guys -- I've been in favor of everything. So when they were talking about stimulus, home modification, the Federal Reserve is doing what they needed to, I don't think the country realized how close we were to a depression.\n\nAnd I've said to the senator several times: I don't think any politician ever gets credit for the problem they avoid. They get a lot of credit if they're in the middle of the crisis and start screaming and yelling, but avoiding a problem doesn't get a lot of merit. This deficit is one of those situations.\n\nAMANPOUR: Were you -- were you shocked that -- that the president could not close a trade deal with Seoul, a major ally? The United States has propped up South Korea, troops there. I mean, how is this possible?\n\nCONRAD: No, I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I think the president -- what he did is a show of strength, rather than weakness.\n\nAMANPOUR: How?\n\nCONRAD: Because he refused to take a bad deal. Look, I've been deeply involved with negotiating with our Korean friends, and they have used every stratagem to avoid previous commitments they have made. And the president called them on it and said, look, you said you would open our market, your market, and you've got an obligation to do it, and I'm not going to accept just any deal in order to have a deal.\n\nThank goodness we've got a president now who is standing up, even to some of our allies, and saying we're insisting on fair treatment.\n\nAMANPOUR: And what did you think when some of our allies called American policy clueless, economic policy?\n\nCONRAD: Well, this was separate...\n\nAMANPOUR: That doesn't show a huge amount of respect.\n\nCONRAD: Yeah, this was separate from...\n\nAMANPOUR: Right.\n\nCONRAD: ... separate from the Korean deal. This -- this involved the question of what the Federal Reserve was doing, which is not the president.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right\n\nCONRAD: This is the Federal Reserve policy to inject liquidity into the economy, given the fact 1 in every 6 people in this country is either underemployed or unemployed, so certainly additional steps need to be taken. I think it's very clear on the fiscal side we've about run the course. There's not going to be another stimulus package.\n\nSo if there's going to be more liquidity, it's going to have to come on the monetary side from the Federal Reserve. And to say that they're clueless, I think, frankly, demeans those who make the charge.\n\nLook, we have -- I would be quick to remind them -- we have saved their bacon over and over and over all across Europe. They need to remember who's been there for them when they needed help.\n\nAMANPOUR: On that note, Senator, Mr. Cote, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nAnd coming up next, analysis on our roundtable, with George Will, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and foreign policy analyst Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUSH: And it's too bad they call them the Bush tax cuts. They might have a better chance of being extended if they were the Lauer tax cuts.\n\nBOEHNER: I think extending all of the current tax rates and making them permanent will reduce the uncertainty in America.\n\nOBAMA: I continue to believe that extending permanently the upper-income tax cuts would be a mistake and that we can't afford it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: The back-and-forth on whether to extend the Bush tax cuts, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus, and Robert Kagan, foreign policy analyst and author from the Brookings Institution.\n\nThank you all for joining us. Thank you for being here.\n\nThe deficit commission, we had two members just -- just -- just earlier. You've written very, very strongly about a lot of the proposals, among other things, saying this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes. I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all.\n\nBut, you know, anybody, it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while padding my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?\n\nAMANPOUR: What should they have done?\n\nKRUGMAN: What they -- what they were supposed to do was produce something that was good enough to have an up-and-down vote, something that a lot of people could sign on to, and they did not do that.\n\nIn particular, now, leaving aside the distributional stuff -- which is awful -- the core of the deficit problem, everybody who's serious knows the core is health care costs, and you have to reduce health care costs, not reduce them, but reduce the rate of growth. The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for.\n\nThey completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary.\n\nSo the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on Earth is that doing in there?\n\nAMANPOUR: What on Earth, George?\n\nWILL: Well, Paul is speaking about the commission in the past tense, as though it has just reported. If fact, 2 of 18 members have now given their ideas; the other 16 have yet to be heard from.\n\nThe most interesting thing they did propose, interesting, A, because it's somewhat radical and, B, because it's opaque as to what it means is a 21 percent limit on revenues, not on spending, but on revenues. And I don't know what a cap means.\n\nOne Congress can't bind the other, and I don't know how institutionally how that would work, but certainly raising the early retirement age to 64 is overdue. Raising the retirement age under Social Security to 69 by 2075 is dilatory, should be done next Thursday.\n\nAMANPOUR: A goer at all? I mean, certainly, the liberals are screaming bloody murder over this.\n\nMARCUS: Actually, both sides are screaming bloody murder. And like most people screaming bloody murder, I think they're behaving incredibly childishly...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you've told the president to be professorial about this, didn't you?\n\nMARCUS: Professorial and the grown-up...\n\nAMANPOUR: Written about it, anyway.\n\nMARCUS: ... and the grown-up in the room. I agree with what Senator Conrad said. The non-report, the recommendations from the co-chairs were a useful dose of shock therapy just to educate people about the incredible gulf that we have between the government that any reasonable person wants.\n\nYou could have a discussion about what size it should be and the revenue that we have to fund it going forward, and you need to understand the scope of the problem before you can agree on solutions.\n\nRight now, 75 percent of people believe you could balance the budget without touching Medicare or Social Security; 75 percent of people believe that you can balance the budget without raising taxes. Well, you could, but it would be extraordinarily painful.\n\nPeople need to get a little bit of reality therapy. There's going to be another dose coming on Wednesday when another group is going to submit their recommendations, very concrete recommendations about how to do it. That's the conversation we need to have before we start picking apart solutions.\n\nKRUGMAN: If they were going to do reality therapy, they should have said, OK, look, Medicare is going to have to decide what it's going to pay for. And at least for starters, it's going to have to decide which medical procedures are not effective at all and should not be paid for at all. In other words, it should have endorsed the panel that was part of the health care reform.\n\nIf it's not even -- if the commission isn't even brave enough to take on the death panels people, then it's doing no good at all. It's not educating the public. It's not telling people about the kinds of choices that need to be made.\n\nMARCUS: But they did talk about -- just -- just as a fact, they did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB...\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes.\n\nMARCUS: ... and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, which -- because it's now rather constrained.\n\nKRUGMAN: They made no headlines with that. And some friends of mine are calling this the commission -- the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about the tax fight which is going to come up? I mean, does that even register with -- in terms of -- in terms of the Brookings Institution, in terms of what you're looking at?\n\nKAGAN: It certainly registers with one-half of the Brookings Institution. It doesn't happen to be the half that I'm in, but, I mean, I think that clearly the whole bundle of issues are going to have to be dealt with together, including, by the way, issues like the national security budget and defense budget, which I think a lot of people think, oh, there's a good pot of money we can go into, but if you look at the foreign policy of this administration, I don't see where they're going to be able to find those kinds of savings.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we had Rand Paul on last week and he said, for instance, he is willing to talk about cuts in military spending. He thought that that was one area where perhaps a wing of Republicans could start talking about in return for a wing of Democrats who could talk about real cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: ... Secretary Gates is talking about that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Precisely.\n\nWILL: Secretary Gates doesn't want to buy any more C-17s. He wants to put a lid on F-22. There are lots of ways of...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: Can I just get into magnitudes here, though? The cost of permanently extending just the upper-end Bush tax cuts, as opposed to only extending the middle-class tax cuts, the 75-year cost of that is just about identical to the 75-year accounting shortfall in Social Security. So we've got people who are saying, oh, Social Security, got to do something about it, but let's extend those tax cuts for rich people. This is showing how the priorities are all skewed (ph).\n\nAMANPOUR: But what is going to happen? I mean, are you clear on where a compromise is going to be? It's got to be discussed before the end of the year, no?\n\nKRUGMAN: No. Some years down the pike, we're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes. It's going to be that we're actually going to take Medicare under control, and we're going to have to get some additional revenue, probably from a VAT. But it's not going to happen now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: ... on the tax thing, for the Bush -- yes, the specific...\n\nMARCUS: I think we know where this is coming out. It's not where it should come out, but I think because everybody agrees that we're going to extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of the people, and because the president doesn't have the votes to not extend the rest, what we're going to do is have some kind of extension for a few years, perhaps, and Senator Warner from Virginia has suggested this. Perhaps we could tweak those cuts to actually make them more attractive to business, more stimulative, more intelligent.\n\nThis is not my preference. I think that the conversation right now is deranged. We have in one room the deficit commission folks saying, \"Look at this huge hole. Look at the tax increases and serious spending cuts that we need to do to fill it.\" And then outside the room, we're having a debate about whether we should add $4 trillion to the deficit long term or a mere $3.3 trillion. This is crazy.\n\nWILL: All the tax cuts are going to be extended. They will not be decoupled. We'll have this argument two, maybe three years from now.\n\nNotice what Paul referred to, the value-added tax. Some while ago, it was thought that this was kind of big bomb that the deficit commission would come in with, an entire new source of revenues. They did not notice that last April the Senate voted 83-13 on a resolution condemning the value-added tax. It will not happen.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's take it overseas. I mean, there is obviously in Britain a value-added tax. There's this debate going on right now in England, in France, Ireland, all over the place, and they're doing serious austerity. And people are asking, can their economies handle that?\n\nWhat do you think is going to be the picture in -- in Britain over the next few years?\n\nKAGAN: Well, it's going to be some very extreme austerity...\n\nAMANPOUR: People are already on the streets.\n\nKAGAN: Right. I mean, we'll see how -- I think that probably Cameron has enough of a -- of a -- of a majority in parliament to hang on, if he's tough. I mean, Sarkozy is fighting this battle right now in France. I think that they can probably hang on.\n\nBut there is a price to be paid. And, again, sorry to return to world affairs. I mean, Britain has taken itself out as a major player in the international system, at least for a while, with the kind of cuts that they've made in their national security budget.\n\nThe problem is, the United States doesn't have the luxury of doing that. I mean, Britain can become a free-rider in the international system, but that is the price that they've paid.\n\nAMANPOUR: And does this -- do these recommendations from the commission, do they amount to any kind of austerity?\n\nKRUGMAN: Oh, no. It's very, very different. Yes, it's austerity long run, although they're very vague about what form that takes. Again, it's caps without real explanation of how they're going to happen.\n\nBut there's a huge difference. There's two kinds of austerity. There's doing things to bring down your long-run costs, which is what Sarkozy is doing in France -- he's trying to change their retirement age -- and slashing right now, when you're in the middle of a deeply depressed economy, which is what Cameron is doing.\n\nThe first I'm all in favor of, if you do it right. The second is basically crazy, but that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: So where do you see the British economy going?\n\nKRUGMAN: And we're going to have -- we're going to have Cameron-type austerity in this country, not as a deliberate policy, but because the state and local governments are going to be slashing their spending. There's going to be no further aid coming from -- from Washington.\n\nAnd so, if you look at the global government budget -- global in the sense of all levels of government in the United States -- we're heading -- we're in Herbert Hoover territory in the United States for sure.\n\nAMANPOUR: I just want to switch a little bit to -- to what you heard Senator Lindsey Graham saying about Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq, he's not happy at all with the -- with the current government and doesn't think the U.S. administration has done a good job. What do you think about that?\n\nWILL: I don't think it's the administration's job to pick Iraq's government, which it's powerless to do. Look, every four years, we flood this little state of New Hampshire with politicians, journalists, poll-takers, political scientists, candidates, consultants, and at the end of the day, we're surprised by what they do in New Hampshire. Why should we be surprised that we're surprised at what the Iraqis are doing?\n\nKAGAN: Well, we don't have -- we don't have, you know, almost 100,000 troops or 50,000 in this case, 50,000 troops in New Hampshire, which might have a greater impact on what voters did. And the truth is, we have been an occupying power in Iraq. We can't pretend that we're not.\n\nIt matters greatly to us what kind of government Iraq has. And I really think the administration -- especially during Chris Hill's ambassadorship -- just took a hands-off attitude. It matters. And it matters before there has to be a feeling among all the different ethic sectarian groups in Iraq that they have some purchase in this government. And right now it feels to them like a Shia government, which is not necessarily...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, talk about the hands-off, because, obviously, during General Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, when he was the ambassador, there was a real hands-on, a real sense of guiding and shaping. Which is better?\n\nKAGAN: Well, when you're the occupying force, you have to have some guiding and shaping. I mean, when we finally leave Iraq, we'll have to leave it to whatever -- you know, the tender mercies of its own political system, which will be -- have its own dysfunctionalities. That's fine.\n\nBut right now, we're looking to pull out. We need to have a government that is capable of satisfying these needs so we don't see the return of Al Qaida in force or you don't see the return of terrorism, which -- which is going to make it harder for us to leave.\n\nAMANPOUR: In Afghanistan, they're trying to do the same thing in Afghanistan, and you've just seen the Washington Post article saying that Karzai does not like the night raids. You heard what Lindsey Graham is saying, that's very disappointing, it's that -- that's the backbone of their strategy right now, and that he heard nothing about that from Karzai.\n\nWhere is Karzai's head right now, do you think, on this?\n\nKAGAN: Well, I'm not sure I know where Karzai's head is, but I do think we have to recognize he's in a difficult position. I don't -- by the way, I'm not totally sympathetic to him, but I am a little bit sympathetic.\n\nHe's the head of a country that's an occupied country that's at war where there are civilian casualties, and -- and he's a politician. And so as a politician, he's reacting to this. But do I think that he wants the United States to pull out of Afghanistan? No. Does he have to say things which look like he's unhappy about some of the things we're doing? Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: So I want to put up this latest commercial about \"don't ask/don't tell.\" I want to show you what Cindy McCain has been saying, talking about war policy and the military.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPINSKY: LGBT teens are six to nine times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers.\n\nC. MCCAIN: Our political and religious leaders tell LGBT youth that they have no future.\n\nNAVARRO: They can't get married.\n\nC. MCCAIN: They can't serve our country openly.\n\nBERGERON: What's worse, these laws that legislate discrimination...\n\nPROBST: ... teach bullies that what they're doing is acceptable.\n\nC. MCCAIN: Our government treats the LGBT community like second-class citizens. Why shouldn't they?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, that's one issue of the gay situation right now, but particularly gays in the military. Do you think in a lame-duck session that they're going to vote on this, on \"don't ask/don't tell\"?\n\nWILL: A, I don't think they will. And, B, if they don't do it, it won't happen for at least two more years.\n\nKRUGMAN: No real opinion on that.\n\nMARCUS: I don't think they'll get it done in the lame-duck. The fascinating thing about Cindy McCain is she's put out a statement saying, well, actually she also agrees with her husband's position, wait, wait, wait, don't do it right now on \"don't ask/don't tell.\"\n\nKAGAN: Exactly.\n\nAMANPOUR: And what's extraordinary, though, is that so many former military chiefs, so many of the former defense secretaries actually back repealing \"don't ask/don't tell,\" and it looks, again -- thanks to the Washington Post -- it looks like the Pentagon review shows that the military in general say that it will have no effect.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how, in this day and age, when you need as many people as you can fighting these wars, when you have our allies who have open gays serving in the military, how it's still this issue here and why you don't think it's going to be taken up in the lame-duck session?\n\nWILL: Well, you referred to a lot of former military people.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, right, but they have experience.\n\nWILL: Well, check with the...\n\nAMANPOUR: They've been there.\n\nWILL: Check with the commandant of the Marine Corps, which is a small service...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, I know the commandant of the Marine Corps, but...\n\nWILL: ... a small service that's specialty is small-unit combat, and that's where they think the issue matters most (ph).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: But the review is meant to suggest that the military thinks that it won't have any impact.\n\nWILL: Then the -- then the review is not representing a consensus of the military.\n\nMARCUS: It's irrational. It's incoherent. It's going to end, but slowly.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, we're going to talk about this -- hopefully, you'll talk about more of this in the roundtable, because it is really fascinating. And if it won't come up for another two years, that's a long time down the road.\n\nSo -- and the roundtable does continue in the green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our fact-checks in conjunction with PolitiFact.\n\nStill to come, \"In Memoriam,\" the Sunday funnies, and the story of a politician who won an election and then had it taken away from him. You won't believe why.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: The midterm election here in the United States was the most expensive and also one of the most negative campaigns in recent history. Many candidates simply misrepresented their opponent's positions with little consequence, but not so in Britain, where as ABC's Jim Sciutto reports, one politician learned a hard lesson in truth in advertising.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCIUTTO (voice-over): For a country that's raised campaign mud-slinging to high art...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Taliban Dan Webster.\n\nSCIUTTO: ... British politics can sound pretty tame.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The right honorable gentleman...\n\nSCIUTTO: And they may just have gotten tamer. Philip Woolas, parliament member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, was hustled out of office, his May election victory overturned for allegedly lying about his opponent.\n\nSTEWART: So, wait, in Britain, politicians can lose their seat for making false statements about their opponents? Wow, that's how our people get elected.\n\nSCIUTTO: This was the offending flier, which accused his opponent of wooing Islamic extremists.\n\nWOOLAS: I was devastated by the process.\n\nSCIUTTO: The now-former M.P. spoke to ABC News exclusively.\n\n(on-screen): It's an enormous price to pay. You won an election, and you've had that seat taken away from you.\n\nWOOLAS: The case hinged around in the end three lines in a leaflet. I took responsibility for that leaflet, but my election team actually wrote it, because he's not a criminal. This is an election matter. It's about who said what to who when. To my mind, it's the stuff of politics.\n\nSCIUTTO (voice-over): The stuff of dirty politics, two British judges ruled, dirty enough to nullify an election for the first time here in 99 years.

It\u2019s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. \u201cI\u2019m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,\u201d he says as he plows toward the ballroom.\n\nInside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson\u2019s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman\u2014a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband\u2019s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.\n\nThe room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script\u2014a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. \u201cI was telling one of my buddies up there, \u2018You know, it\u2019s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Well, don\u2019t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.\u2019\u201d Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. \u201cAnd then he says, \u2018Thompson, you got it all covered.\u2019\u201d Everyone laughs.\n\nToday, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. \u201cWe can\u2019t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We\u2019ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can\u2019t prove they\u2019re terrorists within 24 hours, you\u2019ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain\u2019t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.\u201d\n\nSomeone shouts \u201cGo, Fred, go.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. \u201cPeople talk about the last election. They say, \u2018The war, the war, the war,\u2019\u201d Thompson says with a sigh. \u201cI think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it\u2019s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.\u201d\n\nA minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. \u201cMaybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.\u201d The applause builds to a standing ovation. \u201cYou know, I had another comment or two,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cbut I think that\u2019s the perfect place to stop.\u201d\n\nThompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. \u201cYou know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,\u201d Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. \u201cWithout raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I\u2019ve already saved $50 million this year.\u201d Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.\n\nSince announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson\u2019s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn\u2019t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.\n\nPhoto: Daily News\n\nSo far, the Thompson bubble has floated skyward on several favorable updrafts. He\u2019s the newest man in the race\u2014and one with celebrity name recognition. He\u2019s a Southerner and arguably the most conservative candidate in a field devoid of hard-liners. Despite his eight years in the Senate, people seem to buy the idea, for the time being anyway, that he\u2019s a Washington outsider. And all of his opponents have significant liabilities. But then again, so does Thompson. Among them are his work ethic and authenticity.\n\nThompson is often compared to Ronald Reagan, not just because they are both actors, but also because of each man\u2019s almost preternatural affability. But Reagan was an unalloyed ideologue when America was looking for one, with eight years as the chief executive of what amounts to one of the world\u2019s largest countries. He wasn\u2019t elected until his third campaign, when he defeated a weak Democratic incumbent. Fred Thompson is in a different place. If he\u2019s going to be elected the leader of the Free World, he may have to do it on the strength of his not inconsiderable personal charm.\n\nYou can\u2019t get to Fred Thompson\u2019s hometown from here. Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is located 28 miles from the nearest interstate. Its rolling hills are picturesquely dotted with pigs and cattle, but it remains one of the state\u2019s poorest areas. \u201cThis town hasn\u2019t been the same since the Yankees came in and opened the Murray bike factory,\u201d says Tommy Beuerlein, who owns a downtown pharmacy and was a classmate of Thompson\u2019s. The bike factory arrived in 1955. \u201cNixon was right about there being a silent majority in America,\u201d Beuerlein proudly says. \u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\nOn a recent summer day, eighteen people attended a city-council meeting dealing with the local problem of illegal dumping of couches. A few steps away, 71 residents, some of them as young as 9, attended a shotgun-safety class. \u201cYou have to respect your zone of fire,\u201d insisted the instructor. \u201cVice-President Cheney didn\u2019t respect his zone of fire, and look what happened.\u201d\n\nMuch of Thompson\u2019s down-home affability can be attributed to his roots in Lawrenceburg, where as a child he pretended to be Western star Lash LaRue and courted his high-school sweetheart underneath the town\u2019s Davy Crockett statue (true story). But while Thompson may be a country boy, he\u2019s a certain type of country boy: the one who plays possum while you mock his cornpone ways. Next thing you know he\u2019s got your girl and holds the deed to your farm.\n\nThompson\u2019s father, Fletch, ran a used-car lot in the center of town, and would talk Republican politics at the Blue Ribbon Caf\u00e9. Neither of Thompson\u2019s parents attended high school (his father eventually earned a GED), and Fred, the first of two sons, proved to be an indifferent but popular student. Even as a kid, Fred had a flair for showmanship. One of the building blocks of the Thompson legend is the story of his concerned football coach\u2019s running onto the field to check on an injured Thompson. When coach Garner Ezell reached his player, Thompson smiled at his fellow Church of Christ parishioner and quipped, \u201cHow\u2019s the crowd takin\u2019 it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFred said it,\u201d says Ezell. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t ever hurt. He was just tired and wanted a rest.\u201d\n\nEven a blind squirrel sometimes finds a nut, and Thompson has always seemed to have a way of stumbling into success. By all accounts, Thompson\u2019s work ethic kicked in at 17, when he got his sweetheart Sarah Lindsey pregnant and immediately proposed. \u201cI barely got out of high school,\u201d Thompson told the Washington Post in 1985. \u201cI was interested in two things\u2014and sports was one of them.\u201d\n\nBecause of his marriage, Thompson didn\u2019t play sports his senior year, and he put in long shifts at the bike factory to support his new family. The following fall, the newlyweds headed to nearby Florence State, now the University of North Alabama, before transferring to Memphis State, from which they both graduated. Sarah\u2019s grandfather was an influential Lawrenceburg lawyer, and her family urged Thompson to apply to Vanderbilt Law School. After graduating, the couple moved back to Lawrenceburg, and Thompson practiced law with Sarah\u2019s uncle and began dabbling in local GOP politics, eventually joining the county\u2019s Republican Executive Committee. It was through that group that Thompson caught the eye of another accidental benefactor, Tennessee senator Howard Baker. Thompson worked on Baker\u2019s 1972 reelection, sometimes driving the senator around Tennessee, and the two men struck up a friendship.\n\nBy the next year, Watergate was everywhere. And while Yale and Harvard up-and-comers like Hillary Clinton and Bill Weld clawed for minor legal positions, Baker offered Thompson a coveted slot as minority counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee.\n\nPhoto: Brett Flashnick/AP\n\nIn 1975, Thompson wrote about the experience in his book At That Point in Time: The Inside Story of the Senate Watergate Committee, portraying himself as the picture of the awestruck country lawyer. He insists when Baker offered him the job in February of 1973, \u201cthe only names I could recall without prompting were Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy.\u201d\n\nBecause it was a Republican investigator who had uncovered the fact that Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield had admitted that the White House featured an elaborate taping system, Baker insisted that a Republican cross-examine Butterfield the next day so the GOP could maintain the illusion of impartiality\u2014and take credit. On national television, Thompson asked Butterfield the now famous line, \u201cAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?\u201d Butterfield famously answered yes (as everyone already knew he would). It was Thompson\u2019s first star turn, a role that marked him in America\u2019s minds as a righteous heavyweight prosecutor.\n\nThompson\u2019s own book suggests he wasn\u2019t exactly an impartial participant in the proceedings, however. He admits to leaking the news about the Butterfield discovery to Nixon\u2019s lawyers without authorization. Transcripts from the Nixon Tapes also suggest Thompson was at least partially in Nixon\u2019s pocket. As the Watergate Committee prepared to call Nixon aide John Dean, Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt coached Thompson on how to question Dean. Buzhardt told Nixon, \u201cI found Thompson most cooperative, feeling more Republican every day.\u201d The next day, Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig reported to the president, \u201cHe [Thompson] thinks we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d Of course, they were not. Not long after, Dean became the first Nixon aide to directly tie the president to the break-in and cover-up. But Thompson\u2019s reputation as a plain-speaking crusader for truth and justice had already been made.\n\nThompson\u2019s acting career also happened by accident. After parlaying his Watergate fame into big speaking fees and the start of a lucrative lobbying career (his clients included Westinghouse and the Tennessee savings-and-loans industry), Thompson returned to private practice in Tennessee. There, he wound up representing Marie Ragghianti, the head of the Tennessee Parole Board who was fired by Democratic governor Ray Blanton for exposing a parole-for-sale scheme. Ragghianti sued for wrongful dismissal, and Thompson won the case. Serpico author Peter Maas wrote a book about Ragghianti\u2019s story that was eventually optioned as a movie with Sissy Spacek slated to play the title role.\n\nAccording to Thompson lore, director Roger Donaldson had to plead with Thompson to audition to play himself. \u201cThe idea of him playing himself was reached,\u201d Donaldson told the Nashville Tennessean in May of this year. \u201cAnd so I said to Fred, \u2018Would you be interested at having a go at playing yourself?\u2019 He was like, \u2018Shucks, do you think I could do that?\u2019 I said, \u2018You never know until you try.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, back in 1985, when the movie was made, Thompson freely admitted he\u2019d lobbied Donaldson hard until he scored an audition. Although the film wasn\u2019t especially successful, Thompson received raves, including one that described him as the movie\u2019s \u201creal discovery.\u201d\n\nBored with the law and in the process of getting a divorce from Lindsey, Thompson started work on a novel and began going on auditions. The book was never published, but within a few years, Thompson had become a Hollywood go-to guy for gruff government types, eventually playing a CIA director in No Way Out and a navy admiral in The Hunt for Red October. Most of his parts didn\u2019t take long to film, so Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game. Tennessee insiders tried to persuade Thompson to run for the retiring Baker\u2019s seat in 1984, but he declined, quipping to the Washington Post, \u201cthe hassle factor is up and the pay is not.\u201d\n\nThe day after his South Carolina speech in June, Thompson headed to New Hampshire for a bit of packaged politicking to be chronicled by the home team. With rare exceptions, Thompson has limited his media exposure to reliably conservative outlets like The Weekly Standard, Sean Hannity, and Fox News. This morning, Fox had the exclusive.\n\nThe first stop was Riley\u2019s gun shop, the largest rifle-and-pistol joint in New Hampshire. A few minutes after noon, two black SUVs barreled down the two-lane blacktop and were waved into the parking lot by a Thompson aide. The cars emptied, and Thompson emerged with Jeri. Thompson\u2019s blue suit was a torrent of wrinkles\u2014he conjured up \u201960 Nixon more than \u201980 Reagan. His better half looked, well, better in a smart black suit that seemed a slight bit of overkill for a gun-and-ammo stop. They held hands and walked up a wheelchair-accessible ramp into Riley\u2019s, where two or three customers idly chatted with the help about the stability of this or that rifle scope.\n\nPhoto: JP Laffont/Sygma/Corbis\n\nThompson glanced around at the 4,000 guns, and strode toward an employee. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into your record, and I\u2019m really looking forward to you getting into the race,\u201d said Robert Brown, a 34-year-old salesman. Thompson beamed, pumped his hand, and told him, \u201cWe need to get back to basics.\u201d\n\nFred and Jeri then made a loop of the store, pausing before a glass display case that could be used to showcase engagement rings. Here at Riley\u2019s, it housed a dozen glimmering Saturday night specials. Thompson lovingly nudged his spouse and tilted his noggin toward a coal-black .38 Smith & Wesson and cooed, \u201cHoney, would you like one of those?\u201d\n\nOn the way out, I tried again to get Thompson to veer off-script. I jokingly asked him if he had more experience hunting than does Romney, who had been lampooned for saying he hunted varmints. As in a bad movie, time stopped for a second as I realized I\u2019d just set foot on a land mine of my own laying. Jeri beamed, and Fred halted his walk back to the car. He shot a look at the camera crews\u2014Fox had sent two\u2014and waited a second for everyone to settle in again. This is why they made the visit: It was time to contrast the man\u2019s man Thompson with his effete competitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a little different eating habits,\u201d joked Thompson. \u201cI\u2019ve hunted pheasants, and I like to skeet shoot. We\u2019d hold a celebrity skeet-shooting contest in Washington, raise money for juvenile diabetes. Now, I\u2019ve held it, I\u2019ve never won it. They couldn\u2019t slow those things down enough for me.\u201d\n\nThe Fox crew nodded appreciatively. A moment later, the SUVs peeled away. The whole stop lasted far shorter than an episode of Law & Order, and was just as well-directed.\n\nThompson changed his mind about the Senate in 1993, when Al Gore was elected vice-president and his seat became open. Thompson\u2019s opponent was Congressman Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat and the son of a former governor. At first, the candidates projected similar images of dark-suited blandness. \u201cI remember an early event at the Peabody hotel in Memphis,\u201d says Mike Kopp, Cooper\u2019s press secretary. \u201cCooper was a black hole of charisma: He didn\u2019t have any, and he\u2019d suck up yours. But Fred didn\u2019t come across as exactly electric.\u201d\n\nIn May 1994, Thompson trailed badly and talked of quitting. Frustrated, he called Knoxville political consultant Tom Ingram, who had masterminded Lamar Alexander\u2019s 1978 election as Tennessee governor. Alexander wasn\u2019t Mr. Personality either, but he caught fire when Ingram put him in a plaid shirt and had him walk across the state (a tactic, it\u2019s worth noting, that later bombed when Alexander ran for president). Thompson and Ingram met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant halfway between Nashville and Knoxville. \u201cHe was talking of getting out, and I asked him how\u2019d he want to do this,\u201d remembers Ingram. \u201cFred said, \u2018Just driving around talking to people.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s get you a truck and do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough some of his campaign staff protested the move as cheesy, they leased Thompson a red Chevy pickup and he hit the road. Cooper attempted to paint Thompson as phony, calling him a \u201cGucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon\u2013spreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist.\u201d But voters loved the truck. They didn\u2019t seem to mind that the candidate often switched from a sedan to the truck just miles from his appearances. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe anyone was buying it,\u201d says Kopp. \u201cWe underestimated him. What we didn\u2019t get is that Fred is the country version of a street kid. He\u2019s been talking his way out of situations since he was in high school. He\u2019s a charmer. People fall for it.\u201d\n\nKopp and Ingram are friends, and Kopp expresses admiration for the consultant\u2019s work. \u201cFred Thompson was miscast at the beginning of the race,\u201d Kopp says. \u201cSo Tom just recast the role, and Fred Thompson played it perfectly.\u201d\n\nIngram disagrees. \u201cThe reason the truck worked is that that is Fred Thompson. Gimmicks fail in campaigns all the time because they don\u2019t ring true. Yeah, Fred is a lawyer and an actor, but he is also a country guy. People sense that.\u201d\n\nThompson ended up winning by twenty points, partially aided by the Gingrich sweep of 1994. He drove the red truck to Washington where his old boss Baker threw a raucous party for him. According to The Washington Monthly, a gleeful Thompson mentioned that the craziness made him think of the party his fellow Tennessean Andrew Jackson had at the White House on the night of his inauguration.\n\n\u201cOne office at a time,\u201d cautioned Baker.\n\nA few hours after the Riley\u2019s stop in Manchester, Thompson reappeared for a fund-raiser at Bedford\u2019s Wayfarer Inn, a hotel known for decades as a base for reporters boozing their way through the New Hampshire primaries. On this 90-degree summer scorcher, the air-conditioning in the small conference room where Thompson was supposed to greet high rollers was on the fritz. Not even Jeri\u2019s perky smile and repeated recanting of \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jeri, and I\u2019m your official greeter tonight\u201d could relieve the torpor.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, Thompson emerged, covered in sweat and looking dangerously gray. For a moment, a \u201cWhat the hell have I got myself into?\u201d look crossed his face. There was another, less exclusive fund-raiser just down the hall, packed with TV cameras (the Fox exclusive had been lifted), but Thompson bargained for some down time. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t look like a man in game shape.\n\nTwenty minutes later, a car drove him to the other side of the hotel, either to make his entrance grander or to save him the two-minute walk. After a brief introduction, Thompson took the microphone and talked about terrorism. He spoke in a reassuring, fatherly voice. \u201cWe\u2019re confronted with a group of people who killed thousands of our people and would like nothing more than to get their hands on technology to kill millions,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready to resume a war that\u2019s been going on for hundreds of years, and they have another hundred-year plan. Some of our leaders got a plan for the next election,\u201d he continued, presumably referring to those leaders who want to pull out of Iraq. \u201cAnd they think they can win votes out of it.\u201d As a policy idea, it wasn\u2019t what one would call a breakthrough, nor was it much of an applause line. When Thompson talks about issues, his speeches tend to lose focus and drift.\n\nBut when the speech ended and the music blared, Thompson got in the Country Fred groove. He was doing the walk and talk, where he is most successful. \u201cKeep your powder dry,\u201d Thompson told his fans. He paused mid-mob to answer a Franklin Pierce College poli-sci student\u2019s question about entitlements. This time it was a TV reporter who ventured an unsanctioned question, asking Thompson whether he was a lazy man. Thompson didn\u2019t get angry; he just laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said about me before I ran the first time, and that\u2019s what they said about me two years later,\u201d he replied. \u201cI won the first time by twenty points, and 21 points the second time. If you can do that while being lazy, I recommend it to everyone.\u201d\n\nthe greatest testament to the power of Fred Thompson\u2019s down-home likability might be that his Senate years were widely viewed as a train wreck, yet he emerged not only unscathed but also as a presidential contender.\n\nThings started auspiciously enough. Because Thompson had been elected to fill Gore\u2019s unexpired term, he was sworn in a month before other freshmen senators on December 9, 1994. Republicans didn\u2019t waste any time putting the actor in front of the cameras. On December 15, Thompson gave the Republicans\u2019 response to President Clinton\u2019s budget address. Thompson spoke for only five minutes, but he struck a chord. A STAR IS BORN read the headline of Frank Rich\u2019s New York Times column.\n\nBut that would be the high point. Thompson spent the next two years accomplishing almost nothing of significance other than raising money for his 1996 reelection: Thompson brought back the red truck and won in a walk.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton easily trounced Bob Dole in that year\u2019s presidential race, allegations surfaced that the Chinese government had funneled money into the Clinton campaign and that Al Gore had attended a fund-raiser at a Los Angeles Buddhist temple financed by foreign nationals. Thompson, chairman of the previously backwaterish Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which had jurisdiction, called for hearings.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the hearings that July, the papers were filled with stories of Thompson\u2019s Watergate role and his prosecutorial flair. The Democrats\u2019 ranking minority member was John Glenn, and the conventional wisdom was that Thompson would charm the octogenarian into submission. It didn\u2019t happen. Thompson condescended to Glenn and alienated members of his own party. When New Hampshire Republican Bob Smith announced in his opening statement, \u201cIt is probably the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic,\u201d Thompson turned to the Democratic side, rolled his eyes, and muttered, \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Thompson donated his Senate papers to the University of Tennessee. Some of his archives are filled with notes of off-the-record interviews Thompson conducted with reporters during his Senate years. In his papers, Thompson complains about the trouble he had managing his colleagues during the 1996 hearings. He speaks of \u201cmembers on your [own] side, grilling your team to a point where [you have to] get them to a room, woodshed them, [on] how to ask questions, how to proceed.\u201d\n\nThompson was also accused of grandstanding, and his relationship with then Republican Senate leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell quickly soured. Soon Thompson was warring with both sides. \u201c[We have] presidents at fund-raisers, Lott [saying] raising money is the American Way, [and] McConnell [is the] Darth Vader of Reform,\u201d Thompson says in one of the off-the-record sessions found in his archives.\n\nThompson\u2019s hearings grew even more unpopular with his own party when he diverted the proceedings to the subject of campaign-finance reform (Senate Republicans opposed such reform for fear of losing hard-won fund-raising advantages). Lott was furious, and Thompson suspected the majority leader was the anonymous author of quotes criticizing the hearings.\n\nThe senator further angered conservatives by becoming an early supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. Although Thompson has recently tried to minimize his enthusiasm for the bill, his Senate papers include a handwritten note from Senator Russell Feingold after the measure passed the Senate in 2001 reading, \u201cYou were essential to our success from the outset!\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s Senate years also featured a level of sympathy for Bill Clinton that conservatives don\u2019t tend to share. In 1995, Thompson\u2019s archives show, he sent Clinton a note after the State of the Union address that partially read, \u201cThe speech probably would not have seemed so long to some of us if you hadn\u2019t been putting the wood to us so effectively.\u201d Thompson\u2019s 1999 split vote on Clinton\u2019s two counts of impeachment squared with one of his off-the-record sessions in 1998, when he told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m prejudiced in his favor, I object to the tactics used against him.\u201d This didn\u2019t stop Thompson from sending Kenneth Starr a congratulations letter at the end of the Clinton saga.\n\nThompson may blast colleagues for not draining the Washington swamp, but he did his share of feeding the alligators. His papers include ingratiating notes to George Will, Arianna Huffington, and Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham. There\u2019s a mash note from Bruce Willis (\u201cYou were great in Die Hard\u201d) and a letter from Oliver Stone thanking Thompson for brokering an interview with Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray.\n\nThompson\u2019s off-the-record chats with reporters also suggest that his claim that he hasn\u2019t given much thought to running for president might be somewhat disingenuous (his campaign has attempted to make a virtue of the fact that Thompson, unlike his competitors, isn\u2019t obsessed with power). During one 1998 off-the-record bull session, Thompson boasted to a reporter, \u201cAl Gore goes to bed at night and says, \u2018Please don\u2019t let it be Fred Dalton Thompson.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a senator and movie star of a certain age, Thompson was a steadily sought-after D.C. bachelor. He alternately dated Lorrie Morgan, a five-times-married country-music star, Republican pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, former Time columnist Margaret Carlson, and Washington socialite Georgette Mosbacher. \u201cI chased a lot of women, and a lot of women chased me,\u201d Thompson told Republican congressmen earlier this year. \u201cAnd those that chased me tended to catch me.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s relationships with the Washington elite, romantic and otherwise, have paid significant dividends. This March, Carlson talked up Thompson\u2019s presidential possibilities on MSNBC, rhapsodizing, \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s charming, he sounds like a president, and he looks like a president.\u201d She didn\u2019t disclose their prior personal relationship.\n\nThompson scored more gravitas points last month when Washington Post columnist and socialite Sally Quinn breathlessly wrote that Vice-President Dick Cheney was on his way out and should be replaced by, yes, Fred Thompson. \u201cEverybody loves Fred,\u201d Quinn wrote. \u201cHe has the healing qualities of Gerald Ford and the movie-star appeal of Ronald Reagan.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, they both appeared in the 1994 remake of Born Yesterday.\n\nTalking about his Senate years in July, Thompson said, \u201cWhen I served eight years, I left. I was following George Washington\u2019s model of serving eight years, getting on his horse, and never coming back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only partially true. After 9/11, Thompson announced he would seek reelection the next year. But in January 2002, Thompson\u2019s daughter Betsy died of an accidental drug overdose, ending a long, troubled life. In March, Thompson withdrew his candidacy and sharply criticized the media coverage of Betsy\u2019s death. \u201cI simply do not have the heart for another six years,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nA few months before he left office, Thompson received a call. This time, his career angel was Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, who offered him the role of Arthur Branch over the phone. He immediately accepted. Thompson kept his hand in the lobbying game in 2004 by taking on Equitas Ltd., a British reinsurer responsible for paying out millions in asbestos claims. Equitas wanted Senate legislation that would limit its liability and paid Thompson $760,000 over the next three years. He also serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and in 2005 help shepherd Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts through his Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIn 2002, Thompson married Jeri. The couple met in 1995 (Jeri was a Republican spokesperson at the time) on the Nashville yacht of Dale Gish, on the Fourth of July. Their relationship was on and off for years, with Kehn memorably complaining about other rivals to the New York Post in 2000. \u201cThey just won\u2019t leave him alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get up to get a cocktail at a party without coming back and finding some girl sitting in my chair.\u201d Fred and Jeri have since had two children, Hayden and an 8-month-old son named Samuel.\n\nLast November, Thompson said he wouldn\u2019t run for president, telling a political dinner-party gathering, \u201cI would have had to start two years ago if I was going to run. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to jump back in.\u201d\n\nBut with Giuliani, McCain, and Romney appearing vulnerable, Howard Baker began making calls around Washington to gauge the interest for a late-entering telegenic southern senator.\n\nOr so the story goes. Some Republican insiders say it is Jeri who is fanning Thompson\u2019s presidential aspirations. While Ingram won\u2019t confirm that, he does say Jeri played an influential role in the handling of her husband\u2019s April announcement that he had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but is now in remission. The move was seen as a way of clearing the decks for a Thompson presidential run. \u201cHe relies on her,\u201d Ingram says. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely partners.\u201d\n\nTo some, Jeri has already become a target. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough mused, \u201cYou think she works the pole?\u201d and the New York Times \u201cStyles\u201d section raised the question of whether America was ready for a trophy-wife First Lady.\n\nAfter getting the high sign from Thompson, Ingram began talking up a Thompson candidacy on Capitol Hill, where Ingram now works as Lamar Alexander\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cI was at the Capitol Hill Club at Bill Hecht\u2019s table,\u201d recalls Ingram, name-dropping the presence of a prominent Republican lobbyist. \u201cCongressmen and lobbyists were coming up to me, and they were all really excited. It\u2019s the closest thing to a presidential draft in my lifetime,\u201d Ingram insists. I asked him whether the well-heeled well-wishers were familiar with Thompson from his Senate days. He hemmed and hawed a bit. \u201cWell no, they mostly know him more from Law & Order than the Senate, but Fred\u2019s not acting on the show. That\u2019s exactly the way Fred was in his Senate office.\u201d\n\nNow comes the hard part. With Thompson all but officially in the race, the media has begun training its sights on his backside. First, the Times dissected the political-consulting careers of Thompson\u2019s two sons and mentioned the payments totaling $170,000 from Thompson\u2019s political action committee to his son Daniel. Then Thompson\u2019s previously noble Watergate image took a hit in the Boston Globe when Scott Armstrong, a man Thompson had labeled a leaker 30 years ago, exacted a measure of revenge by calling Thompson a Nixon \u201cmole.\u201d\n\nThe most damaging allegation was a Los Angeles Times story claiming that Thompson lobbied the first Bush White House in 1991 on behalf of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, a pro-choice organization. At first, Thompson\u2019s people denied it. Then they said he didn\u2019t remember it. On day three, Sean Hannity, quickly becoming Thompson\u2019s Boswell, offered the senator an opportunity to explain himself. Thompson replied, \u201cIn the first place, you need to separate a lawyer advocating a position for the position itself.\u201d The answer may have been factually correct, but it came across as the kind of dissembling voters\u2014especially conservative ones, in this case\u2014despise.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson pushed back his official announcement from early to late July and now, perhaps, to after Labor Day. All of this only sharpened the lingering question of whether Thompson is up for the job. He\u2019s also got to raise millions and build a campaign team in a hurry.\n\nThompson\u2019s supporters point to his folksy charm, which they insist will play especially well in key southern and midwestern swing states. And the lack of anyone to the right of Thompson, however imperfect he may be as a conservative, means that the party base will ultimately be forced to back him, they say.\n\nBut Thompson\u2019s strongest card, his backers say, is his Hollywood-fueled image of strength. \u201cPeople think that with presidential candidates, you need a lot of information about them,\u201d says Tony Fabrizio, a GOP pollster not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s all about the concept. He has the Schwarzenegger Factor. Just like it\u2019s impossible to make Schwarzenegger look weak because people see him as the Terminator, voters see Fred as the tough-talking D.A. or the captain in Hunt for Red October. It\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nThose are the rational arguments. Fred Thompson is counting on something a little more visceral.\n\nOn July 10, Thompson made a last-minute trip to suburban Atlanta for the omnipresent Sean Hannity\u2019s Freedom Concert, a fund-raiser for Oliver North\u2019s scholarship fund that benefits the sons and daughters of service personnel killed in action.\n\nBeforehand, there was a meet and greet for supporters at the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce. Thompson took exactly one question and shrugged when I asked him about the impact of the recent media attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any arrows,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a page from his dress-casual Senate campaigns, Thompson wore a camel-colored sport jacket, an open-necked shirt, slacks, and brown loafers. He thanked his supporters for turning out on short notice and pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re playing by our own rules.\u201d He touched on the well-grooved themes of competence and the \u201cshenanigans in Washington,\u201d but today he struck a more acutely patriotic chord. \u201cA lot of smart people have looked at the history books and said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s been a pretty good run. Lots of civilizations have lasted a little longer, but they all declined and got fat and happy and sassy and weak. And they all just faded into the sunset.\u2019\u201d Thompson was working the room without a microphone and spoke quietly and even slower than usual. \u201cThat is not going to happen on our watch.\u201d You could practically hear the martial music.\n\nAfter posing for pictures, Thompson was ushered next door to the Gwinnett Arena, where 12,000 people were gathered. Hannity opened the show with a Hillary imitator getting off gems like \u201cMy husband moved from the White House to Harlem. Of course, he read the map wrong and thought it said \u2018Harem.\u2019\u201d The party faithful pounded their hands in approval but quieted for the pledge of allegiance.\n\nAfter the Christian rock band Avalon performed, Thompson was introduced. He read a patriotic poem about the war, took his bows, then sat down in the audience and watched with rapt excitement as the comedian Larry the Cable Guy glided through a set. \u201cMy doctor told me I had to give up eggs,\u201d said Larry, tugging at his trucker cap. \u201cI said, \u2018Why, because of my cholesterol?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, your farts are killing us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe arena echoed with laughter. Over in his seat, Thompson slapped his thigh and gave an \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2019cause it\u2019s true\u201d full-body shake. He seemed to be having the time of his life. It is hard to imagine Rudy or Romney, Hillary or Barack, sitting through the set, much less soaking it all in.\n\nThe fashionable book in high-level political circles these days, the one the candidates and their staffs have been talking about, is The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation by Drew Westen. The central idea is that voters don\u2019t make rational calculations about a candidate and his positions. They vote for the person they just plain like. Fred Thompson\u2019s best hope is that Westen is right.", "comment_3": "rt @Pursuitist Matthias Schoenaerts by Bruce Weber for The New York Times Style Magazine: \nThe actor... http://t.co/JFJ4kDQXEF #luxury", "split": "train"}

Most of the nine items are Trump\u2019s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because Trump himself hasn\u2019t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn\u2019t respond to our request for more information, and doesn\u2019t seem to have answered other media outlets\u2019 requests, either.\n\nPerhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he\u2019s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.\n\nThe Facts\n\nCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.\n\nThe law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)\n\nAfter the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.\n\nThat year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.\n\nTrump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.\n\nThe one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: \u201cI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There\u2019s no more gun-free zones.\u201d His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.\n\nOur colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal \u201craises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?\u201d\n\nTrump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?\n\nTrump\u2019s answer was still devoid of specifics:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I\u2019m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it\u2019s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, \u2018This is incredible. This is perfect. There\u2019s no guns in there. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to have guns.\u2019 You can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I\u2019m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I\u2019m allowed to do that. . . . But we can\u2019t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, \u2018We are a gun-free zone.\u2019 And then you have these crazy people out there saying, \u2018Boy, this is the most incredible thing,\u2019 and that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren\u2019t clear yet.\n\nTrump said he would \u201cwork with the states\u201d but that he would \u201coverride the states if I have to.\u201d Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.\n\nThe Geppetto Checkmark\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "comment_3": "Clinton campaign's claim that Trump would 'force schools to allow guns in classrooms' https://t.co/EDwxTsZCvj", "split": "train"}

Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta\u2019s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump\u2019s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump\u2019s Sunday night\u2019s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans\u2019 freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. \u201cThese words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies\u2019 advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. \u201cDonald Trump needs to humble himself,\u201d Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump\u2019s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: \u201cHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America\u2019s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department\u2019s release of more of Clinton\u2019s own emails from her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump\u2019s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s candidacy appeared\u2014yet again\u2014to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta\u2019s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton\u2019s emails, which he called an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump\u2019s words, however. \u201cWomen have the power to stop Trump,\u201d Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events\u2014and the responses\u2014would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe is talking about sexual assault. There\u2019s no other way to frame this,\u201d Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide\u2019s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches\u2014a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton\u2019s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa\u2019s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? \u201cClinton admits she is out of touch,\u201d \u201cClinton suggests she is a moderate\u201d and \u201cClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: \u201cClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.\u201d Republicans are obsessed with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump\u2019s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump\u2019s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call \u201clocker-room banter\u201d laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women\u2019s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that \u201csuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump \u201ca malignant clown.\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks\u201dtotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said \u201cAmerica deserves far better\u201d than Trump. Trump\u2019s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said \u201cno apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump\u2019s video. \u201cThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,\u201d former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. \u201cShe has to change the narrative.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump\u2019s supporters firmly in their camp. \u201cA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump\u2019s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night\u2019s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.", "comment_3": "How a Leaked Tape of Donald Trump Bragging About Groping Women Changed the 2016 Race - TIME https://t.co/wPq6jWvVMs", "split": "train"}

More recently, she became known in Alaska as a popular maverick, staunchly conservative on key issues but vocal about problems she saw, including those in her own party. Watch how conservatives say they're thrilled with Palin \u00bb\n\nShe got the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her fierce competitiveness on the basketball court in high school. Some of her opponents revived the name after she became mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, in 1996, kicking out a three-term incumbent and butting heads with some city department heads who remained loyal to her predecessor, according to the Almanac of American Politics.\n\nSarah Palin Born: February 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho Education: B.S., University of Idaho, 1987 Elected offices: Wasilla, Alaska, City Council member, 1992-96\n\nWasilla mayor, 1996-2002\n\nElected governor of Alaska, 2006 Professional career: Television sports reporter, 1987-89; co-owner, commercial fishing operation, 1988-2007; owner, snow machine, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business, 1994-97; chairwoman, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2003-04. Married: To Todd Palin; five children. The oldest, Track, serves in the U.S. Army; the youngest, Trig, has Down syndrome. Sources: Almanac of American Politics, CNN\n\n\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, she chaired the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates Alaska's oil and gas resources.\n\nWidely seen as a political outsider who stayed at arm's length from her party establishment, she defeated two political insiders in 2006 to become the youngest, and first female, governor in the state's history.\n\nAs governor, she won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul.\n\nBut her term was not without controversy. A legislative investigation is looking into allegations that Palin fired Alaska's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, a state trooper. She denied wrongdoing.\n\nAn outspoken anti-abortion Republican, Palin has spoken out about her fifth child, who was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome.\n\n\"We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives,\" the Republican National Committee quoted her as saying. \"We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\"\n\nShe is married to her high-school sweetheart, a commercial fisherman. The two eloped in 1988, to save money on a big wedding, a year after she graduated from the University of Idaho, where she studied journalism and political science, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Watch details on elopement \u00bb\n\nPalin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.\n\nAs millions of Americans began searching for information on her Friday, her official Web site as governor wasn't the only one getting flooded with traffic. Traffic also spiked at sites showcasing pictures from 1984, when she wore the crown of Miss Wasilla and competed in the Miss Alaska contest.\n\nShe was born in Idaho, and her parents moved to Alaska when she was 3 months old.\n\nSome similarities between Palin and McCain were clear Friday: Both have been termed mavericks, and both have taken on the GOP establishment at times. McCain has a son who has served in Iraq; Palin has one heading there soon. So does her vice presidential opponent, Sen. Joe Biden.\n\nFor all that is known about her, Palin now becomes the most prominent unknown quantity in the presidential race. Her lack of experience on national political issues, including foreign policy and homeland security, and her only brief experience as governor open clear lines of attack for the Obama campaign. Watch Democrats respond to the Palin pick \u00bb\n\nThen again, McCain's surprising announcement Friday and the intense focus it drew threatened to slow Obama's post-convention momentum in a dramatic way.\n\nNo stranger to being a first in Alaska, Palin now faces being a first on a national level: the first female No. 2 on the GOP presidential ticket and only the second female on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro more than 20 years ago.\n\nSchumer described McCain's choice as a \"Hail Mary pass.\" Whether that's true has yet to be seen.\n\nBut what's not in question is that in entering the race, Sarah Palin changes the game.\n\nAll About Sarah Palin \u2022 Alaska \u2022 John McCain", "comment_3": "Palin: Pioneer, maverick -- and now game-changer - CNN International http://tinyurl.com/5emjjv", "split": "train"}

The United States declared its independence from Great Britain in 1776. The American Revolutionary War ended in 1783, with Great Britain recognizing U.S. independence. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1785. The United States broke relations when it declared war on the United Kingdom during the War of 1812; relations were reestablished in 1815.\n\nThe United States has no closer ally than the United Kingdom, and British foreign policy emphasizes close coordination with the United States. Bilateral cooperation reflects the common language, ideals, and democratic practices of the two nations. Relations were strengthened by the United Kingdom\u2019s alliance with the United States during both World Wars, in the Korean conflict, in the Persian Gulf War, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in Afghanistan, as well as through its role as a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The United Kingdom and the United States continually consult on foreign policy issues and global problems and share major foreign and security policy objectives.\n\nRegarding Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, \u201cNationalist\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d groups seek a united Ireland that includes Northern Ireland, while \u201cUnionists\u201d and \u201cLoyalists\u201d want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. U.S. priorities continue to be supporting the peace process and devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland and encouraging the implementation of the U.S.-brokered 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nU.S. Assistance to the United Kingdom\n\nThe International Fund for Ireland (IFI), created in 1986, provides funding for projects to generate cross-community engagement and economic opportunity in Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) and the border counties of Ireland. Since the IFI\u2019s establishment, the United States and EU have contributed the vast majority of funds, with the United States allocating more than $540 million.\n\nBilateral Economic Relations\n\nThe United Kingdom is a member of the European Union and a major international trading power. By October 31, 2019, the United Kingdom expects to be outside of the EU known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The United Kingdom is one of the largest markets for U.S. goods exports and one of the largest suppliers of U.S. imports. The United States and the United Kingdom share the world\u2019s largest bilateral foreign direct investment partnership. The United Kingdom and United States are holding scoping discussions to determine how best to deepen and broaden the bilateral economic relationship, including ensuring continuity through Brexit and laying the groundwork for a possible free trade deal in the future. The United Kingdom is a large source of foreign tourists visiting the United States. It participates in the Visa Waiver Program, which allows nationals of participating countries to travel to the United States for certain business or tourism purposes for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Membership in International Organizations\n\nThe United Kingdom and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, G-20, G-7, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.

DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15\u201330 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you\u2019ve ever really known.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who\u2019ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.\n\nI\u2019m sure this election has been stressful for you.\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation\u2019s problems. That\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not kind, and it\u2019s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.\n\nMany of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You\u2019ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn\u2019t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.\n\nI want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential \u2014 that\u2019s what makes our country great, and that\u2019s the promise I\u2019m going to fight to fulfill.\n\nSo here\u2019s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you\u2019ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country \u2014 and that\u2019s what DACA can provide.\n\nBut I know that\u2019s not enough \u2014 we have to do more for you and your families. That\u2019s why as president, I\u2019m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\n\nWhile we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court\u2019s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president\u2019s authority and won\u2019t stop fighting until we see it through.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it\u2019s helped so far \u2014 and let\u2019s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.\n\nWe have always been a nation of immigrants \u2014 those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won\u2019t forget it, and I won\u2019t forget you.\n\nThank you \u2014 and keep being brave,\n\nHillary", "comment_3": "\u201cTo young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.\u201d by Hillary Clinton https://t.co/QE7z2LWsLy", "split": "train"}
{"comment_2": "Barack Obama says Mitt Romney condemned coal-fired power plants as killers http://t.co/hjWEHFkV", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Open: President Barack Obama says Mitt Romney condemned coal-fired power plants as killers: PolitiFact Ohio http://t.co/taQBvBcF #OHPol", "article": "Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs.\n\n\n\nYou could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But Romney\u2019s greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said.\n\n\n\nThis debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn\u2019t play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that Romney\u2019s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\"Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people,\" said an Obama campaign news release.\n\nThe claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts.\n\nThe quotes:\n\n\"That plant kills people.\" This was in reference to the Salem Harbor power plant, in the Boston area.\n\n\"I will not create jobs that kill people.\" This, too, was made by Romney outside the Salem Harbor plant.\n\nThe Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said: \"If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health.\"\n\n\n\nRomney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.\n\n\n\nMassachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the \"Filthy Five\" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.\n\n\n\nAs occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor\u2019s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.\n\n\n\nBut the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor:\n\n\n\n\"Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.\"\n\n\n\nThis was in a news release issued by the governor\u2019s aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Romney\u2019s development chief, Douglas Foy. According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nThe spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem Harbor\u2019s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts\u2019 emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: \"That plant kills people.\" And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: \"I will not create jobs that kill people.\"\n\n\n\nBased on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). That\u2019s what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email.\n\n\n\nSo was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that Romney\u2019s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?\n\n\n\nWe kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under Romney\u2019s name suggested it as well.\n\n\n\nRomney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.\n\n\n\nStill, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? Wasn\u2019t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?\n\n\n\nNo, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF.\n\n\n\nTheir claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently.\n\n\n\n\"When he said that \u2018this plant kills people,\u2019 he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest,\" said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.\n\n\n\nJonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar Association\u2019s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes.\n\n\n\n\"The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed,\" Kaplan agreed. \"He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.\"\n\n\n\nTo see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database.\n\n\n\nNitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.\n\n\n\nThe level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio,\" Walke said.\n\n\n\nYou might ask why we looked at Eastlake. It\u2019s because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plant\u2019s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits won\u2019t take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.\n\n\n\nBut as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With Romney\u2019s name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them:\n\n\n\n\"First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children. Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.\"\n\n\n\nRomney was \"a champion\" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. \"He was one of the reasons we got them through.\"\n\n\n\nTime to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said, \"That plant kills people.\" But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.\n\n\n\nAnd the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal.\n\n\n\nIf one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, it\u2019s fairly safe to assume that \"one would also support such things nationally,\" said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health.\n\n\n\nThe Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio.\n\n\n\nThe debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time.\n\n\n\nBut with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship, the Obama campaign claim about Romney\u2019s coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day.\n\n\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Mostly True.", "comment_3": "Barack Obama says Mitt Romney condemned coal-fired power plants as killers http://t.co/KBWGSBmU", "split": "train"}

But, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\nSoldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They\u2019re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It\u2019s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\nWhy armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (\u201c\u2018This my property!\u2019 he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.\u201d) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that \u201cWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone\u201d?\n\nOlson added, \u201cthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\u201d\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\u201d\n\nBernick continued, \u201cfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\u201d\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \u201ctoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\u201d\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown\u2019s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.\n\nWitness Tension Between Police and Protestors in Ferguson, Mo.

S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)\n\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\n\n\n\n\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR\n\n[*] SCHIEFFER: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.\n\nThe rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.\n\nI will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.\n\nI'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.\n\nThe audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome.\n\nBy now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.\n\nAnother very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.\n\nSenator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.\n\nSenator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.\n\nI will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?\n\nSenator McCain, you go first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.\n\nAnd thanks to Hofstra.\n\nAnd, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.\n\nIt's good to see you again, Senator Obama.\n\nAmericans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.\n\nAnd they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.\n\nBut we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.\n\nLet me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.\n\nThe catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.\n\nI am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.\n\nNow, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.\n\nNow, I know the criticism of this.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned. And so we've got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Senator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.\n\nI think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.\n\nAnd I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.\n\nNumber one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.\n\nNumber two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.\n\nNow Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.\n\nI disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don't want to waste taxpayer money. And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.\n\nLast point I want to make, though. We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away. We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Would you like to ask him a question?\n\nMCCAIN: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.\n\nJoe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.\n\nYou were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.\n\nNow Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.\n\nAnd I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That's 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Is that what you want to do?\n\nMCCAIN: That's what Joe believes.\n\nOBAMA: He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's. Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.\n\nNow, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.\n\nWhat I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.\n\nOBAMA: Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \"Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\"\n\nAnd what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.\n\nThe last point I'll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.\n\nMCCAIN: You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.\n\nI want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.\n\nThe whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around. I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.\n\nWho -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.\n\nI'm not going to...\n\nOBAMA: OK. Can I...\n\nMCCAIN: We're not going to do that in my administration.\n\nOBAMA: If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...\n\nMCCAIN: We're talking about Joe the plumber. OBAMA: ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.\n\nThen Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.\n\nSo, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.\n\nMCCAIN: Nobody likes taxes. Let's not raise anybody's taxes. OK?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I don't mind paying a little more.\n\nMCCAIN: The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, it's 11 percent.\n\nWhere are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?\n\nWe need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.\n\nNow, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to another topic. It's related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.\n\nThis question goes to you first, Senator Obama.\n\nWe found out yesterday that this year's deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.\n\nBoth of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.\n\nAren't you both ignoring reality? Won't some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?\n\nGive us some specifics on what you're going to cut back.\n\nSenator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.\n\nBut there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.\n\nNow, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I haven't made a promise about...\n\nSCHIEFFER: But you're going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.\n\nOBAMA: And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better. It's not improving our health care system. It's just a giveaway.\n\nWe need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.\n\nNow, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.\n\nIf we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.\n\nIf we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.\n\nBut what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.\n\nAnd we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nSenator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.\n\nAnd they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.\n\nSo, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But what...\n\nMCCAIN: But -- OK. All right.\n\nSCHIEFFER: The question was, what are you going to cut?\n\nMCCAIN: Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.\n\nAnd the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.\n\nOK, what -- what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say that's a hatchet. That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?\n\nBecause we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.\n\nGovernment spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.\n\nI know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Which ones?\n\nMCCAIN: I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.\n\nI oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.\n\nI would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.\n\nI know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.\n\nBut I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nMCCAIN: ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen.\n\nAnd, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.\n\nNow, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.\n\nEarmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem.\n\nNow, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.\n\nWhen President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.\n\nOBAMA: And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.\n\nSo one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.\n\nWe've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Senator McCain.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure I do. And let me tell you...\n\nSCHIEFFER: You can still do that?\n\nMCCAIN: Yes. Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.\n\nSenator Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. It's completely out of control.\n\nThe mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. They're doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...\n\nSCHIEFFER: In four years?\n\nMCCAIN: ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.\n\nNow, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.\n\nSenator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama. Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.\n\nI have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Barack.\n\nOBAMA: Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support...\n\nMCCAIN: An overwhelming vote.\n\nOBAMA: I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists. So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.\n\nNow with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.\n\nEven FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.\n\nNow, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasn't worked.\n\nAnd I think the American people understand it hasn't worked. We need to move in a new direction.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right...\n\nMCCAIN: Let me just say, Bob.\n\nSCHIEFFER: OK. About 30 seconds.\n\nMCCAIN: OK. But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. I've got the scars to prove it.\n\nWhether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.\n\nI have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. We're going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, your campaign has used words like \"erratic,\" \"out of touch,\" \"lie,\" \"angry,\" \"losing his bearings\" to describe Senator McCain.\n\nSenator McCain, your commercials have included words like \"disrespectful,\" \"dangerous,\" \"dishonorable,\" \"he lied.\" Your running mate said he \"palled around with terrorists.\"\n\nAre each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?\n\nAnd, Senator McCain, you're first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, this has been a tough campaign. It's been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.\n\nWhen Senator Obama was first asked, he said, \"Any place, any time,\" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.\n\nAnd the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.\n\nOne of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.\n\nAnd, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks. Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.\n\nSo I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.\n\nAnd when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, \"I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,\" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't.\n\nAnd that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up. All right.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.\n\nAnd 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.\n\nMCCAIN: It's not true.\n\nOBAMA: It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.\n\nThe notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.\n\nWhat the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.\n\nSenator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.\n\nAnd I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college. And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\n\nOBAMA: Congratulations.\n\nMCCAIN: Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it's not true. You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I don't.\n\nYou're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.\n\nAnd of course, I've been talking about the economy. Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around. I'm going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.\n\nThat's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.\n\nBut again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...\n\nOBAMA: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.\"\n\nAnd I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.\n\nNow...\n\nMCCAIN: You've got to read what he said...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Let -- let -- let... MCCAIN: You've got to read what he said.\n\nOBAMA: Let me -- let me complete...\n\nSCHIEFFER: Go ahead.\n\nOBAMA: ... my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.\n\nAnd, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.\n\nThe important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.\n\nMCCAIN: I cannot...\n\nOBAMA: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...\n\nMCCAIN: We do and I hope...\n\nOBAMA: ... talking about it this evening.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure.\n\nOBAMA: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. What we're talking about...\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just say I would...\n\nSCHIEFFER: (inaudible)\n\nMCCAIN: Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.\n\nBut to somehow say that group of young women who said \"Military wives for McCain\" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say \"World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,\" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.\n\nAnd I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.\n\nIn fact, some T-shirts that are very...\n\nOBAMA: John, I...\n\nMCCAIN: ... unacceptable. So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.\n\nBut the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I haven't.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, Bob, as I said...\n\nSCHIEFFER: I mean, do you take issue with that?\n\nOBAMA: You know, here's what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns. I suspect we won't agree here tonight.\n\nWhat I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.\n\nOBAMA: And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long. And I think...\n\nMCCAIN: Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Short answer, yes, short answer.\n\nMCCAIN: Yes, real quick. Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\n\nWe need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for \"lighting and site selection.\" So all of these things need to be examined, of course.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. I'm going to let you respond and we'll extend this for a moment.\n\nOBAMA: Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let's get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.\n\nForty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.\n\nOther members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.\n\nMr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that's Mr. Ayers.\n\nNow, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.\n\nIt had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.\n\nNow, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.\n\nLet me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.\n\nThose are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN. So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.\n\nOBAMA: That's absolutely not true.\n\nMCCAIN: And the facts are facts and records are records.\n\nOBAMA: And that's not the facts.\n\nMCCAIN: And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.\n\nAnd my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that you're going to bring into the government. And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.\n\nSCHIEFFER: So I'll begin by asking both of you this question, and I'll ask you to answer first, Senator Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?\n\nOBAMA: Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.\n\nBut it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.\n\nAnd, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.\n\nThat's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.\n\nBecause after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.\n\nSo, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America. She's a reformer. She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, \"This can't go on.\"\n\nShe's given money back to the taxpayers. She's cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.\n\nShe's a reformer through and through. And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.\n\nShe'll be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.\n\nShe understands that better than almost any American that I know. I'm proud of her.\n\nAnd she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.\n\nHer husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think she's qualified to be president?\n\nOBAMA: You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.\n\nAnd I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John.\n\nI do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.\n\nAnd if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it. That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think Senator Biden is qualified?\n\nMCCAIN: I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.\n\nHe voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.\n\nIn Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them. We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.\n\nThere are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I open and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.\n\nBut again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, \"We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer\" -- why do we always have to spend more?\n\nWhy can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to -- let's go to a new topic. We're running a little behind.\n\nLet's talk about energy and climate control. Every president since Nixon has said what both of you...\n\nMCCAIN: Climate change.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n\nWhen Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. Now, we're importing more than 60 percent.\n\nWould each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?\n\nAnd I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain. MCCAIN: I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine.\n\nBy the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, \"Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.\"\n\nYou don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.\n\nWe can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess.\n\nSenator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.\n\nLook, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.\n\nSo the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.\n\nSo I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?\n\nOBAMA: I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that's about a realistic timeframe.\n\nAnd this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It's mortgaging our children's future.\n\nNow, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.\n\nNumber one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.\n\nAnd I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.\n\nThat's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.\n\nWe invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.\n\nOBAMA: Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.\n\nAnd what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.\n\nAnd when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That's all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. We've got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It's doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now.\n\nNow, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.\n\nBut let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.\n\nBecause of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.\n\nAnd also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.\n\nFree trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.\n\nOBAMA: Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.\n\nAnd what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.\n\nBut I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.\n\nAnd the last point I'll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.\n\nThat's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.\n\nAnd Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.\n\nIf we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.\n\nFree trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.\n\nSo I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.\n\nWe're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right, let's go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.\n\nLook, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance.\n\nAnd they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.\n\nSo here's what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything. If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.\n\nThe only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.\n\nWe're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.\n\nWe are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.\n\nAnd we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We've got to put more money into preventive care.\n\nThis will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nSenator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.\n\nAnd it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.\n\nWe need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will -- that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.\n\nThe rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know what's going on there.\n\nWe -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.\n\nBut I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.\n\nNow, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.\n\nMCCAIN: Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.\n\nSenator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.\n\nIf you like that, you'll love Canada and England. So the point is...\n\nSCHIEFFER: So that's your objective?\n\nOBAMA: It is not and I didn't describe it...\n\nMCCAIN: No, you stated it.\n\nOBAMA: I just...\n\nMCCAIN: Excuse me.\n\nOBAMA: I just described what my plan is. And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there. Here's your fine -- zero. You won't pay a fine, because...\n\nMCCAIN: Zero?\n\nOBAMA: Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.\n\nI exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.\n\nRight now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.\n\nThe average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.\n\nSo here's what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.\n\nIf you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.\n\nNow, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan. He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance.\n\nHere's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.\n\nOlder folks, let's healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.\n\nAnd once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.\n\nAnd this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.\n\nBy the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.\n\nLast point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.\n\nThat, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.\n\nSCHIEFFER: What about that?\n\nMCCAIN: Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.\n\nNow, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.\n\nThat's big government at its best. Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.\n\nAnd the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.\n\nThis will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.\n\nThis really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.\n\nSenator Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.\n\nMCCAIN: I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. That's what I'm all about. And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.\n\nWe can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. A short response.\n\nOBAMA: Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.\n\nThat's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And don't take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\n\nAll I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Senator McCain. Senator McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Senator Obama, you believe it shouldn't.\n\nCould either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue? Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. That's not appropriate to do.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But you don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?\n\nMCCAIN: I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. I'm a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test. Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.\n\nWe got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, \"conservative judges.\"\n\nI voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue we're talking about.\n\nSenator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. That's not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so that's what I will do.\n\nI will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?\n\nMCCAIN: I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\n\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\n\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\n\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\n\nOBAMA: So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\n\nI'll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\n\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.\n\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\n\nI think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that's the kind of judge that I want.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nMCCAIN: Obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyer's dream.\n\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.\n\nSenator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\n\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\n\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\n\nI don't know how you vote \"present\" on some of that. I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.\n\nAnd he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Response?\n\nOBAMA: Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true. The -- here are the facts.\n\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\n\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\n\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\n\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\n\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that -- look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.\n\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\"\n\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation.\n\nOBAMA: We should try to reduce these circumstances.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's give Senator McCain a short response...\n\nMCCAIN: Just again...\n\nSCHIEFFER: ... and then...\n\nMCCAIN: Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\n\nThat's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, \"health.\" But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.\n\nBut that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I'm afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.\n\nThe question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.\n\nThe implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.\n\nDo you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?\n\nThe question to Senator Obama first.\n\nOBAMA: This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power. So we've got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.\n\nIn some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.\n\nI think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.\n\nAnd I think it's important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.\n\nAnd that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.\n\nIf we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.\n\nBut there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents. We can't do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century. There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.\n\nBut what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?\n\nSo choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.\n\nAnd we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.\n\nNow, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.\n\nSo I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.\n\nMCCAIN: We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.\n\nLook, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.\n\nNow we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.\n\nSo what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.\n\nCharter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.\n\nAnd we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.\n\nWhere we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.\n\nRecently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.\n\nI don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.\n\nAnd if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It's not going to happen on its own.\n\nSCHIEFFER: What about that, Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, sure. I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.\n\nBecause they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.\n\nAnd we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was voucher, Senator Obama. And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.\n\nNow as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it.\n\nBut, again, spending more money isn't always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.\n\nLet's reform it. Let's reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.\n\nAnd I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we'll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.\n\nMCCAIN: But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.\n\nAnd I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it's been proven.\n\nOBAMA: I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...\n\nMCCAIN: Who supports vouchers.\n\nOBAMA: ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.\n\nMCCAIN: She supports vouchers, also.\n\nOBAMA: But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.\n\nThat leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.\n\nSo if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And that's what I intend to do as president.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working. I got it.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nGentlemen, we have come to the close. Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, I'd like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evening's debates and the three that preceded tonight's debate.\n\nNow, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Senator McCain goes first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you again, Bob.\n\nThanks to Hofstra.\n\nAnd it's great to be with you again. I think we've had a very healthy discussion.\n\nMy friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today.\n\nAmerica needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.\n\nI have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.\n\nAnd I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.\n\nWe have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.\n\nAll of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.\n\nThat's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.\n\nI've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. As a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.\n\nAnd I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again. I'd be honored and humbled.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.\n\nI think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nAnd that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.\n\nWe need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.\n\nYou know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes. You've shared your stories with me. And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.\n\nAnd that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.\n\nBut we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.\n\nThese are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.\n\nBut it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.\n\nI'm absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, Senator McCain, thank you very much.\n\nThis concludes the final debate. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong. Good night, everyone.\n\nEND\n\nTranscription by: CQ Transcriptions/Morningside", "comment_3": "watch http://snfd.tv/zmp Third Presidential Debate HQ (Part 7) \"Billy Ayers, ACORN\" - Obama vs McCain 2008 3rd Presidential Debate - 10/1...", "split": "train"}

But I 've learned that a freedom is most at risk when it 's in the hands of honest people who think, for some perceived common good, they ought to give it up.\n\n\n\nToday we are a country in shock, still bewildered by what confluence of forces could possibly lead young people to hurt each other.\n\n\n\nIn that tender state, good people are vulnerable. They want to do something, anything, for the common good. Indeed, some are so perplexed about what to do that legislators admit from the outset that their legislation could not have prevented the very crimes that provoked drafting it.\n\n\n\nThat's the very definition of a perceived, but fictitious, common good.\n\n\n\nAs this made-for-TV lawmaking gets played out, it needs a villain. So good Americans have been exposed daily to a well-coordinated systematic bashing of the National Rifle Association 's membership as somehow a reckless societal pathogen, a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution, and reason.\n\n\n\nThat is a cruel and dangerous lie.\n\n\n\nBecause nobody --nor any combination of entities you care to add up --has invested even a measurable fraction of what we have invested toward keeping safety and sanity central to the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment.\n\n\n\nAnd nobody is more committed than we are to keeping guns out of criminals 'hands. That's obviously in our best interest. It's just whether you believe you 're more likely to keep guns and criminals apart with new laws you write and ignore, or with existing laws you enforce.\n\n\n\nSome think our insistence on enforcement is unreasonable. Others say we oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership. So let's talk about what's reasonable and what's not.\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone. That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mental ill are in the system.\n\n\n\nThis isn 't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to\n\nnews interviews and press appearances. But I 've repeatedly emphasized that this Administration must stop illegally keeping records of lawful gun buyers.\n\n\n\nIn fact, it 's the media 's well-kept secret that the NRA was an early architect and supporter of the National Instant Check System now in place. Congressman McCollum knows we worked with him on instant checks more than a decade ago.\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and\n\npawn shops. But what 's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people like felons who 've walked away from gun stores --instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to prevent all juveniles convicted of violent felonies from owning guns,\n\nfor life. What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg can prevent your law-abiding son from\n\ninheriting his grandpa 's shotgun collection because Lautenberg classifies him as a gun show dealer who must be federally regulated.\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to prosecute more than just two dozen thugs last year for putting illegal guns in criminals 'hands. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg considers legal guns in private hands subject to intrusive federal regulation, even in the privacy of your home.\n\n\n\nFor a century we 've taught it 's not just reasonable but essential to use safety locks, trigger locks, gun safes or any voluntary means appropriate to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. What's unreasonable is that Lautenberg can put you in prison just for failing to keep records on how many guns you own.\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to make gun show instant checks just like gun store instant checks.\n\nWhat's unreasonable is how Lautenberg could define your Walmart, or your uncle 's skeetshooting range, or your next-door firearms collector, or your local sporting clays competition, or\n\nany person or place with 50 or more firearms as a \"gun show \" subject to mtrusive government regulation. That 's crazy!\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to demand strict prosecution of criminal activity, whether it takes place in\n\na big-city alleyway or small town gun show. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg instead demands strict registration of law-abiding gun buyers, b oiving the federal government the name and address, type of gun and serial number ---not of criminals but of Americans deemed NOT to be criminals by the instant check!\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to provide full funding for the National Instant Check System so it\n\noperates efficiently and instantly. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg authorizes an unlimited gun tax on purchases by law-abiding citizens.\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to expect our government to prosecute more than 24 hoods last year for providing guns to criminals. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg makes everyone\n\nprosecutable if you just talk about buying or selling a gun at a gun show --even if you have no gun in your possession!\n\n\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to support the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. What 's unreasonable is letting 6,000 students caught with illegal guns at school go, prosecuting only 13 of them the past\n\ntwo years.\n\nWe think it 's reasonable to demand that when a lawful gun buyer passes the criminal background check and purchases a firearm, records of that transaction be destroyed immediately. What 's unreasonable is Lautenberg 's decree that we trust government bureaucrats to compile and keep\n\nWe think it 's reasonable is to expect full enforcement of federal firearms laws by the federal government. What 's unreasonable is when the Justice Department claims that federal gun laws are\n\nfor the states to enforce! Reasonable people know that a case made in state court means plea bargains, judge shopping and no mandatory minimum sentencing. Even Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia knows this, even if the Justice Department does not. He said, quote: \"In state court, we average for these types of gun violations a 4-month prison sentence. The federal guidelines are\n\n59 months in prison. That 's a 5 l/2 year difference. Incarcerating convicted felons in possession\n\nof firearms for that length of time will save lives. It will save carnage. It will save people from being maimed. \"\n\n\n\nThat's why we support Project Exile --the fierce prosecution of federal gun laws that has cut crime rates overnight the few places it 's been tried. Even though this Administration resists it, we think\n\nit's reasonable because it works.\n\n\n\nWe only support what works, and our proud list is long. From Project Exile to three-strikesyou're out, to truth in sentencin g, to ten-twenty-life, to mandatory minimums --what 's reasonable is what works; what 's unreasonable is what doesn 't work.\n\n\n\nWhat's unreasonable is further erosion of privacy, further intrusion into private transactions, and further government penalizing of the law-abiding many instead of the lawbreaking few. America will not tolerate further surrender of precious freedoms in return for nothing but perceived but\n\nfictitious promises that make none of us safer.\n\n\n\nThe Lautenberg legislation is not only unreasonable, it is unworkable . . . unacceptable . . . and to\n\nour Founders who gave us the Second Amendment, unthinkable.\n\nAnd finally --somebody's got to say this out loud: It 's reasonable for well-meaning people to convene hearings like this to find and fashion solutions. What 's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric becomes acceptable because it 's aimed at honest gun owners, as in the violent language of influential film-maker Spike Lee who last week reportedly said about NRA President Charlton Heston, quote, \"Shoot him --with a .44 caliber Bulldog. \" By his defiant silence, instead\n\nof the quick apology most American role models would offer, he sanctions hate and bears his share\n\nof culpability for the kind of violence this body seeks to stop.\n\nOn behalf of millions of gun owners who are NRA members, and tens of millions who are not yet, I am asking you to practice yourselves what is so readily preached to us: Be reasonable.\n\n", "comment_3": "the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland information that does not pertain to a subscriber; (2) it imp", "split": "train"}

Thank you very much, Mike, thank you for the introduction, but\u2014more than that\u2014for your service to our country, and our partnership during the four years I served as secretary of state. What happens in Vladivostok stays in Vladivostok.\n\nI am delighted to be back here at Stanford. And I will never forget the day that we first brought Chelsea here. I brought her to visit when she was thinking about schools, but I knew as soon as she saw Stanford that this is where, if she were fortunate enough to be admitted, she would certainly choose to come. And, of course, I remember when Bill and I brought her here to begin her freshman year, and then the dinner for parents that Mike was referring to. So it\u2019s a great treat to be back.\n\nAnd now that my daughter is a mother herself\u2014you can imagine\u2014there\u2019s already talk, at least among one or two members of our family, since her husband is also an alum of Stanford, about how good Charlotte would look one day in Cardinal red.\n\nI am delighted to be here with some very distinguished guests. Secretary Shultz, Secretary Perry, thank you both for being here with us. Lanny, thank you. Marcos, thank you, and others. It\u2019s really a great treat for me to be not only at the university, but at this particular institute as well. You have really made Stanford a center for national security scholarship, and that is the principle reason why I am here today.\n\nYesterday\u2019s attack in Brussels was the latest brutal reminder that our fight against ISIS and radical jihadist terrorism is far from finished.\n\nMore than 30 innocent people are dead\u2014men and women, hurrying to catch a plane, or waiting for a train, or meeting a loved one. Hundreds more are wounded, including three Mormon missionaries from Utah; a U.S. Air Force officer, his wife and four children; and other Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Americans here at home are worried. The threat we face from terrorism is real, it\u2019s urgent, and it knows no boundaries. Even as Brussels grieves, the memories of Paris and San Bernardino are painfully fresh as well. On Saturday, a bombing in Istanbul killed four people, including two U.S.-Israeli dual citizens. Many other places have been targeted by terrorists in the past year alone. Hotels in West Africa. Beaches in Tunisia. A market in Lebanon. A Russian passenger jet in the Sinai.\n\nISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. It beheads civilians. It enslaves, tortures, and rapes women and girls.\n\nWalls will not protect us from this threat. We cannot contain ISIS\u2014we must defeat ISIS.\n\nThis will be one of the most important challenges facing the next president, who takes office on January 20. Our new commander in chief will walk into the Oval Office and find a world of hard choices and complex problems. That president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect the lives\u2014and livelihoods\u2014of every American, and people around the world.\n\nSo, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nToday, I want to emphasize three points.\n\nFirst, we face an adversary that is constantly adapting and operating across multiple theaters, so our response must be just as nimble and far-reaching.\n\nSecond, to defeat this transnational threat, we need to reinforce the alliances that have been core pillars of American power for decades.\n\nAnd third, we need to rely on what actually works\u2014not bluster that alienates our partners and doesn\u2019t make us any safer.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by being clear about what we are facing: ISIS controls a shrinking but still sizeable territory in Iraq and Syria. It leads a far-flung network that includes affiliates across the Middle East and North Africa, and cells in Europe, Asia, and even here in North America. It\u2019s also part of a broader ideological movement that includes other terrorist groups.\n\nWe need to do battle on all these fronts.\n\nLast year, in speeches in New York and Minneapolis, I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, around the world, and here at home. Recent events have only reinforced the urgency of this mission.\n\nFirst, we do have to take out ISIS\u2019 stronghold in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWe should intensify the coalition air campaign against its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure; step up support for local Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground and coalition efforts to protect civilians; and pursue a diplomatic strategy aimed at achieving political resolutions to Syria\u2019s civil war and Iraq\u2019s sectarian divide.\n\nSecond, we must dismantle the global network of terror that supplies money, arms, propaganda, and fighters. This means targeted efforts to deal with ISIS affiliates, from Libya to Afghanistan. It means going after the key enablers who facilitate illicit financial transactions and help jihadists arrange travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And it means waging online battles with extremists to discredit their ideology, expose their lies, and counter their appeals to potential recruits in the West and around the world.\n\nThird, we must harden our defenses and build our resilience here at home. We need to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack, deterring would-be terrorists and discovering and disrupting plots before they\u2019re carried out.\n\nOur enemies are constantly adapting, so we have to do the same. For example, Brussels demonstrated, clearly, we need to take a harder look at security protocols at airports and other sensitive so-called \u201csoft sites,\u201d especially areas outside guarded perimeters.\n\nTo do all this, we need an intelligence surge\u2014and so do our allies.\n\nWe also have to stay ahead of the curve technologically. That does mean working with the brightest minds here in Silicon Valley to more effectively track and analyze ISIS\u2019s social media posts and map jihadist networks online. When other candidates talk about building walls around America, I want to ask them: How high does the wall have to be to keep the internet out?\n\nAnd we also have to tackle a thorny challenge that is top-of-mind here in the Bay Area: navigating the security and civil liberties concerns surrounding the encryption of mobile devices and communications.\n\nImpenetrable encryption provides significant cybersecurity advantages, but may also make it harder for law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. ISIS knows this, too. At the same time, there are legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors\u2014including terrorists\u2014can exploit.\n\nThere may be no quick or magic fix. In the Apple case, the FBI may have found a work-around\u2014but there will be future cases, with different facts and different challenges. So the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy. A National Commission on Encryption, like Senator Mark Warner and Congressman Mike McCaul are proposing, could help. And our security professionals could use the advice and talents of technology professionals to help us figure out how we do stay ahead of the terrorists.\n\nOur fight against radical jihadist terrorists will be long, and there is very real risk of future attacks here at home. But pursuing this comprehensive strategy will put us in the best position to defeat ISIS and keep our families and communities safe.\n\nThis is a very personal issue for me, having served as a Senator from New York on 9/11. Having seen the horrors that were produced by a well-planned and executed attack on our country. Knowing how important it is that we do stay ahead of those who wish to do us great harm, without panic, without paranoia\u2014but with resolve not to give in to the very behavior the terrorists are hoping to engender.\n\nWe can\u2019t let fear stop us from doing what\u2019s necessary to keep us safe\u2014nor can we let it push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe.\n\nFor example, it would be a serious mistake to stumble into another costly ground war in the Middle East. If we\u2019ve learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan, it\u2019s that people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can\u2014I argue, must\u2014support them, but we can\u2019t substitute for them.\n\nIt would also be a serious mistake to begin \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d populated areas \u201cinto oblivion.\u201d Proposing that doesn\u2019t make you sound tough\u2014it makes you sound like you\u2019re in over your head.\n\nSlogans aren\u2019t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle.\n\nTo do that, we need to strengthen America\u2019s alliances in Europe, Asia, and around the world. And that is the second point I want to emphasize.\n\nOn 9/11, NATO treated an attack against one as an attack against all. On September 12, headlines across Europe, most notably in Le Monde, proclaimed, \u201cWe are all Americans.\u201d There were very few planes in the air that day\u2014but one was a British jet carrying the UK\u2019s top national security leaders to Washington to offer any help they could.\n\nNow it\u2019s our turn to stand with Europe. We cherish the same values and face the same adversaries\u2014so we must share the same determination.\n\nThis is especially true at a time when Europe faces multiple overlapping crises\u2014from President Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, to the massive influx of refugees, to continuing economic challenges, to the rise of right-wing nationalist parties. We have made so much progress together toward the goal of a Europe that is free, whole, and at peace\u2014and we can\u2019t risk letting it fall apart now.\n\nFor decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have understood that America\u2019s alliances make us stronger. Secretary Shultz compared the slow, steady work of building diplomatic relationships to gardening. He knew that when you cultivate effective partners, you can harvest real rewards.\n\nAllies extend our reach, share intelligence, provide troops in conflicts like Afghanistan, offer bases and staging areas around the world for our military, and serve as a bulwark against competitors like Russia and China. And, by the way, both Moscow and Beijing know our global network of alliances is a significant strategic advantage they can\u2019t match.\n\nNATO, in particular, is one of the best investments America has ever made. From the Balkans to Afghanistan and beyond, NATO allies have fought alongside the United States, sharing the burdens and the sacrifices. In the 1990s, Secretary Perry helped guide NATO\u2019s expansion based on the alliance\u2019s core tenets of collective defense, democracy, consensus, and cooperative security. They became known as the \u201cPerry Principles,\u201d and they\u2019re still at the heart of what makes NATO the most successful alliance in history.\n\nTurning our back on our alliances\u2014or turning our alliance into a protection racket\u2014would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.\n\nPutin already hopes to divide Europe. If Mr. Trump gets his way, it\u2019ll be like Christmas in the Kremlin. It will make America less safe\u2014and the world more dangerous.\n\nWhen it comes to the struggle against ISIS, we need our allies as much as ever. We need them to be strong and engaged, for they are increasingly on the front lines. London, Paris, Madrid, Brussels, Istanbul\u2014they\u2019ve all been hit by terrorism. And, as we saw when a terrorist cell in Hamburg carried out the 9/11 attacks: What happens in Europe has a way of making it to America. So it\u2019s essential that we have strong partners who can work with us to disrupt plots and dismantle networks in their own countries before they lead to attacks in ours.\n\nAmerica needs European intelligence services working hand-in-hand with our own, including where they may have better reach and expertise, like in North Africa. We need European banks to stop terrorist financing. We need European planes flying missions over Iraq and Syria, and European special forces helping train and equip local anti-ISIS forces on the ground.\n\nWe need European diplomats and development experts working to improve governance and reduce the appeal of extremism across the wide arc of instability that stretches from West Africa all the way to Asia; together, we can do more. And, more urgently, to support moderate voices and stand with Tunisians, Libyans, Kurds, and others in the region who are trying to do the right thing.\n\nAnd as we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel\u2014our strongest ally in the Middle East\u2014we also have to extend our consultations to Arab partners as well.\n\nAll of this will make America safer, and help defeat ISIS.\n\nThere is much we can do to support our European partners: helping them improve intelligence and law enforcement, facilitating information sharing, working more closely at every level. There\u2019s also more they can do to share the burden with us. We\u2019d like to see more European countries investing in defense and security, following the example Germany and others have set during the Obama administration.\n\nThe most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East. Thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Their European passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home, radicalized and battle-hardened. We need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and start revoking passports and visas.\n\nStemming this tide will require much better coordination among every country along the way. Right now, many European nations don\u2019t even alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. And Turkey, a NATO ally, still has more work to do to control the border where most foreign fighters cross into Syria.\n\nAfter the Paris attack, France and Belgium pledged to move forward together on reforms\u2014but that\u2019s difficult without the European Union. In January, the EU announced a new, integrated counterterrorism center, but intelligence cooperation still lags, and the EU keeps delaying a vote to share traveler information between member states. It\u2019s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state.\n\nThere also has to be a special emphasis on identifying and investing in the hot spots\u2014the specific neighborhoods, prisons, and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, as we\u2019ve seen in Brussels. And it\u2019s time to make good on the promise of establishing a new unified European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen the continent\u2019s external borders, which are under unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants.\n\nNow, this is a heartbreaking crisis.\n\nLast year, the world was horrified by the photo of a drowned toddler lying on a Turkish beach. In the months since then, hundreds more children have died trying to reach safety. We\u2019ve seen Europe and Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Middle East struggle under the weight of this challenge. It\u2019s too big for any one country\u2014or even continent\u2014to handle alone. I\u2019m glad that the EU and Turkey are now working closely together\u2014and the United States should do whatever we can to support that.\n\nThe only truly effective answer is to go to the source: End the conflict that is displacing all these people. So we have to support and maintain the ceasefire in Syria. And we should also work with our coalition partners and opposition forces on the ground to create safe areas where Syrians can remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe.\n\nIn the meantime, it would be wrong to shut our doors to orphans or to apply religious tests for people fleeing persecution. That\u2019s not who we are.\n\nBut of course we have to be vigilant in screening and vetting everyone. We can\u2019t allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations\u2014but we also have to be smart and vigilant about how we process people into our country. It would be doubly cruel if ISIS can not only force families from their homes, and but also prevent them from ever finding new ones.\n\nAnd that brings me to my third point: In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works.\n\nOne thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims.\n\nThere are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in this country. These Americans are a crucial line of defense against terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it\u2019s too late, and the best positioned to block it.\n\nLast year in Minneapolis, I met parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community who are working with law enforcement and mental health professionals to intervene with young people at risk of being radicalized. Efforts like that deserve more local and national support.\n\nSince 9/11, law enforcement has worked hard to build trustful and strong relationships with American Muslim communities. As the director of the FBI told Congress: Anything that erodes that trust makes their job more difficult.\n\nWe need every American community invested in this fight, not fearful and sitting on the sidelines.\n\nSo when Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals, and for racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods, it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s counterproductive. It\u2019s dangerous.\n\nAs a spokesman for the New York Police Department pointed out last night, that kind of blanket bigotry would treat the city\u2019s nearly 1,000 Muslim police officers as threats. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more incendiary, foolish statement,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner Bill Bratton of the NYPD was even more blunt this morning: He said Senator Cruz \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nDemonizing Muslims also alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk from both Republicans and Democrats about the importance of building coalitions with Muslim nations. Having actually done this, I can tell you: Insulting allies and partners is not a good way to start.\n\nAnother thing we know that does not work\u2014based on lots of empirical evidence\u2014is torture.\n\nMany intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops\u2014and, increasingly, our own civilians\u2014at greater risk.\n\nI\u2019m proud to have been a part of the administration that banned torture, after too many years in which we had lost our way.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m president, the United States will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world.\n\nEven when we\u2019re up against opponents who don\u2019t respect human life or human rights, torture is not the right choice. As Senator John McCain has said: The high standard to which we hold ourselves \u201cisn\u2019t about our enemies; it\u2019s about us. It\u2019s about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAmerica is a great nation. And this is a time for American leadership. Smart, strong, steady leadership.\n\nNo other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our people and our values.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t cower in fear or hide behind walls. We lead\u2014and we succeed.\n\nThroughout our history, we have stared into the face of evil and refused to blink\u2014whether it was fascism, the Cold War, or hunting down Osama bin Laden. And we will defeat ISIS, too. No enemy or adversary should ever underestimate the determination of the American people.\n\nI will never forget what it was like to arrive in Brussels for the first time as secretary of state, in March of 2009.\n\nI was on my way to NATO. NATO headquarters was buzzing. Hundreds of young people at the European Parliament had stood and cheered\u2014not for me, but for the idea of American leadership; for the promise of an alliance that delivered unprecedented peace and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need to remember today. Americans cannot\u2014and I believe will not\u2014turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles.\n\nWe\u2019re in it for the long haul. And that means we\u2019re going to work together. And we\u2019re going to prevail.\n\nThis may be another one of the long struggles we have confronted from time to time in our history, but\u2014like all the rest of those\u2014if we can forge a bipartisan consensus, if we can bring our people to understand what this struggle means to us, if we can maintain our alliances and our partnerships, we will be successful.\n\nAnd that will benefit not only our country, but the world.\n\nAnd that, when you boil it down, is what American leadership has to be about.\n\nThank you.", "comment_3": "Remarks on counterterrorism at Stanford University  https://t.co/iGIwVgIxVR #iamwithher", "split": "train"}

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nFor weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city\u2019s newest luxury hotels.\n\nBut that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project \u2014 billionaire developer Donald Trump \u2014 put himself at the center of the nation\u2019s debate over illegal immigration.\n\n[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]\n\nTrump garnered headlines \u2014 and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him \u2014 when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and \u201crapists\u201d crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.\n\nBut a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump\u2019s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs \u2014 while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.\n\nSince Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)\n\nAll of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something ironic,\u201d said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,\u201d Arellano said in Spanish. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.\u201d\n\nInterviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.\n\nSeveral of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cMost of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,\u201d said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country\u2019s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.\n\n\u201cHe might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,\u201d Gonzalez said of Trump.\n\n1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation\u2019s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country\u2019s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nSeveral of the laborers \u2014 who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day \u2014 fumed at Trump\u2019s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.\n\n\u201cDo you think that when we\u2019re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we\u2019re raping or selling drugs?\u201d Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. \u201cWe\u2019re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site\u2019s several hundred workers.\n\n\u201cOur contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,\u201d the \u00ade-mailed statement said.\n\nLend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, \u201crequires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMichael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,\u201d Cohen said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees\u2019 status is accurate.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.\n\nHicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about illegal immigration \u2014 which included a promise to \u201cbuild a great, great wall on our southern border\u201d and bill Mexico for the cost \u2014 reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company\u2019s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.\n\nThe rapid rejection of Trump\u2019s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country \u2014 and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe NBC television network, the Macy\u2019s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump \u2014 part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.\n\nOn Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to \u201cdump Trump\u201d by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump\u2019s hotel.\n\n\n\n[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to \u2018dump Trump\u2019]\n\nAt the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump\u2019s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel\u2019s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.\n\nThe site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington \u2014 with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building\u2019s heyday as the District\u2019s main post office in the early 20th century.\n\nTrucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.\n\nArms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.\n\nAhmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. \u201cMost of the workers here are migrants,\u201d he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, what he said. They\u2019re hard workers.\u201d\n\nFor David Montoya, 28, Trump\u2019s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. \u201cEvery 18 months, I have to get it renewed,\u201d he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.\n\nMontoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story \u2014 one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off \u2014 is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he reflected, \u201cwe\u2019re more American than him.\u201d", "comment_3": "At Trump hotel site, immigrant workers wary http://t.co/eTi6J6zeLi", "split": "train"}

{"comment_2": "PolitiFact | Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003 http://t.co/kTyK44PV via @politifact", "target": "real", "comment_1": "PolitiFact | Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003 http://t.co/rDXwIYB via @politifact", "article": "In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.\n\n\n\n\"We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,\" he said. \"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.", "comment_3": "Bakken Housing News Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003 - http://t.co/3mJFNpUV5p", "split": "train"}

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nKIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR: Super Tuesday, more than 20 states, 40 contests. Candidates give their final pitches right here.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so committed on to making sure nobody goes without health care.\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We want to make sure this party does not leave the house that Ronald Reagan built.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: The issues hit home, health care, the housing crisis. We're talking to voters in the north, south, east and in Super Tuesday's biggest prize, California, on this AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\nAnd welcome. It's a special split edition of AMERICAN MORNING on this Super Tuesday. I'm Kiran Chetry. I'm here at one of the local schools up in Harlem, New York, where we've seen good amount of voters trickling in. Polls have been opened here for about two hours, John. And it looks like the action is heating up a little bit behind me as well, as people are coming in before they head to work to cast their votes today.\n\n\n\nJOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Good for them. I'm John Roberts. We're at the Atlanta diner here in Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody voting here, but they are fueling up in preparation to get out there and vote. It's as close as we'll come to a national primary. Well, at least this year. 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates up for grabs for the Republicans. 1,681 available for the Democrats. Most polls are open right now. We're going to be checking in with voters and our reporters across the country this morning. And we have got them from stem to stern here.\n\n\n\nGot our team on the issues talking to voters from coast to coast. Candy Crowley is live in Harlem this morning. Ed Lavandera in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chris Lawrence in San Francisco and Mary Snow is in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\n\n\nNo primary are caucus there in West Virginia, rather. A state Republican convention that gets under way in about an hour at 9:00 Eastern. 18 delegates at stake there today. And Mary joins us now live from Charleston.\n\n\n\nMary, we were speaking with Mitt Romney this morning who flew overnight from California. There really seems to be a battle in the Republican Party on this Super Tuesday as to who is the real conservative.\n\n\n\nMARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that really is what it comes down to, John, for Mitt Romney. He has been hammering away at that theme -- that trying to portray himself as the real conservative. Trying to poke holes in Senator John McCain's conservative credentials. Mitt Romney will try to make that case here in West Virginia.\n\n\n\nAs you mentioned, the convention getting under way just about an hour from now. This will likely be where we'll hear the first results across the country. Ron Paul is also going to be here. Mike Huckabee. Senator John McCain will not be here, but he will have a surrogate here for him. He is heading out to California before heading home to Arizona. Yesterday he concentrated on the northeast.\n\n\n\nOne of his big themes has been national security. Also cutting government spending. But in terms of the Republican Party, he's trying to make the case, that he can be the uniter. Mitt Romney took his message to California trying to tout his conservative credentials.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hey, we should point out, Mary, that we're looking at that polling place in Chappaqua right now. And there Hillary Clinton and her husband coming in to cast their votes. No question who she'll be voting for this morning. But let's go back to the Republican contest.\n\n\n\nWhere do these candidates need to do well? Obviously, John McCain wants to win the whole thing and become the de facto nominee tonight. But where do the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee have to do well to stay in this race?\n\n\n\nSNOW: Well, you know, for Mitt Romney, one of the states where he really has to do well is Massachusetts. John McCain was campaigning there. Mitt Romney had been governor. He says he plans on winning there. But that would be a blow to him if he did not win in Massachusetts. And obviously, he's counting a lot in California.\n\n\n\nMike Huckabee wants to gain support here in the south. He's been concentrating on that. And Ron Paul has been focusing on states like West Virginia, also Alaska. He's hoping to pick up delegates.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. Mary Snow for us this morning. Let's take it back to Kiran, who is there at Harlem.\n\n\n\nKiran, you spoke with Senator Clinton a couple of hours ago. She's there casting her ballot in Chappaqua this morning. It took just a couple of seconds as well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Yes, that's right. She actually went on early, joining us in the 6:00 hour because it's the 7:00 hour here in New York. She wanted to be at the polling site. Senator Clinton casting her vote just a few minutes ago. And earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, she talked about issues like health care and the economy and a last-minute appeal to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Really are not taking care of people. I want to put the American people first again. And you know, I think there is a lot of reason for people to worry that the president just doesn't pay attention. And I want them to know that I get it and I'll be there for them, if they are willing to go out and vote for me today. And I hope everybody watching will do that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Also a big question today, what do people in the south want in their president. Can Mike Huckabee win beyond Arkansas and can Barack Obama win beyond South Carolina? Tennessee, one of the states we're watching in the south. The polls just opened there moments ago.\n\n\n\nThere are 52 Republican delegates at stake there. 68 for the Democrats and our Ed Lavandera is in Chattanooga. He's been talking with voters this morning. You know, you can't really lump everybody in the same group and say what are southerners thinking this morning. But what is the sense here getting from this that you talk to, Ed?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, in speaking with several political analysts who look at these voters in the south, they really see, kind of a divide, between what they call the upper south and the lower south. So you have Arkansas and Tennessee perhaps going one way, maybe voting more alike and then, you have, Georgia and Alabama perhaps being a little bit more similar. But across the south, a big turnout is expected.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Presidential candidates pour on the southern charm like thick gravy on biscuits.\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not often that a razorback comes to Tuscaloosa and has a good time.\n\n\n\nJOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my sons attended Vanderbilt University. And he married a beautiful, beautiful young lady from Cookeville. And I am so -- and I am so proud of that as well. So, as you can see, I'm puling out all the stops here everybody.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: But in the south, candidates know it takes a spiritual connection, too.\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know most folks were already in church today. So I don't want to give a whole another sermon. And I won't pass the collection plate.\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day, I strive to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Across the Super Tuesday southern states of Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama, both Obama and Clinton Democrats are embracing the most popular theme on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like there's a lot of change that needs to happen as, you know, for the whole country. Not just for the south.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And some Republican leaning voters remain undecided.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: John McCain, I kind of leaning toward him in his military service and I like some of the policies that he's put forth. But Huckabee, right now, I'm leaning kind of heavy toward him.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Emory University professor Merrill Black studies the mind-set of southern voters and on Super Tuesday, he sees division on the Democratic side.\n\n\n\nMERLE BLACK, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I think we're going to see a split here. The Deep South is probably going to go for Obama. The Upper South will probably go for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And on the Republican side, he says McCain is in the driver's seat.\n\n\n\nBLACK: McCain probably will lead the field, but I think Huckabee could be competitive here. The big question mark is how well Mitt Romney would run in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And Kiran, you know, there's one voter in all of the south that many people would like to know, how this particular person is voting, al least, on the Democratic side and that is Former Vice President Al Gore who is from Tennessee, of course.\n\n\n\nWe reached out to his people yesterday and they said that -- we were told that he has already voted. He voted early. But we gave the old college try to find out who he voted for and we were told as a private citizen, he's not sharing that information.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: I am sure that everybody can make a few guesses, but he's keeping mum. All right, Ed Lavandera for us in Chattanooga this morning. Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on eight minutes after the hour now. Will weather affect voter turnout on this Super Tuesday? Our Rob Marciano is checking it out for us this morning.\n\n\n\nRob, anybody going to have a difficult time getting out to the polls today?\n\n\n\n(WEATHER REPORT)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: We're at the beginning of CNN's nonstop Super Tuesday coverage. 40 hours, all day and all night. And join us for a special early edition of AMERICAN MORNING, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And join CNN's Campbell Brown for her \"AMERICA VOTES SPECIAL\" talking to candidates and the issues. That's at noon Eastern on CNN and cnn.com.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Well, we've heard from three possible presidents this morning about the issues. What can they do for you? And we're breaking down, what they told us when it comes to key issues like health care and the economy.\n\n\n\nAlso, Super Tuesday meets the mortgage meltdown. The states voting today where the housing crisis has hit hardest. And how the candidates are promising to fix it? We're going to compare some of their plans. That's coming up ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Welcome back. We've been hearing from the candidates this morning. Let's take a moment to go through what we heard. Senior political correspondent Candy Crowley joins me in Harlem this morning. Breaking down what Democrats talked about. One of the key issues, this morning that we heard from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on health care. And let's just hear quickly what Barack Obama said just moments ago to John Roberts.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What we do is set up a plan that allows anybody to get health care that is as good as health care to the members of Congress. We will subsidize it for those who can't afford it. People won't be able to be excluded from pre-existing conditions. So that, anybody who is self-employed, anybody who doesn't health insurance or is underinsured can join this plan. Now, we also work to lower costs for those who already have health insurance.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It seems like, well, they are quite similar, Barack Obama is not going as far as saying that people would be mandated to get it if they can afford it. Hillary Clinton is, although, it's still unclear exactly how that would be enforced. But who is winning on this issue? And is this an issue that would sway voters?\n\n\n\nCANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they think -- meaning in the camp Hillary, they believe this really is a winning issue. Because she goes out and says -- you know, this is a basic, fundamental Democratic issue. We've got to start with universal health care. He sort of pushes back, as you hear, and says -- listen, I have universal health care. That's where they are going.\n\n\n\nI think Democratic voters look at this and say, they are both headed in the same direction. While there are issues in this campaign that divide them, there are about 95 percent in agreement about these issues. And they are 100 percent in agreement as to the direction they want to go.\n\n\n\nSo in the end, I think Democratic voters come to the polls and sort of say, you know, we have this one candidate who is campaigning on experience. We have another who promises to turn the page. Which direction do we want to go?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You also -- when we were talking briefly before the break, said that, you know, for the Democrats, it's also the issue of who can win it for us this year. And how do the candidates prove that at this point?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, it's all about electability at this point. And because in the end, what Democrats want is to win the oval office. So they are looking at who is the toughest and that's why you see Barack Obama now talking about John McCain, about electability. You hear him saying, you know, we don't want someone who is divisive, read that Hillary Clinton. She talks about how battle warned she is. How she knows who to go after these Republicans because they've come after her.\n\n\n\nSo they're both, in their own way, saying I'm the more electable. And that in the end is really what Democratic voters want to know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: She says, according to her, dug up all the dirt they could possibly dig up. So now they're going to go after the fresh meat.\n\n\n\nThe other interesting element about this is just the way that the Democratic primary caucuses and primaries play out. It's a different situation in terms of gathering delegates. So what does that mean and who gets the advantage, if that's the case?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: You know, first of all, it's so arcane. As you know, it's almost impossible to explain. But basically, what candidates can win a state and still lose the delegates because it's proportionately by district. So what we have to look at tonight is, first of all, who wins the states because in some ways, that's the headline.\n\n\n\nYou know, in these 20-something states, so and so wins 11 or 12. But the bottom line is that they need 2,050 votes to win this nomination. So they are all counting delegates. And I have to tell you, they are counting delegates district by district. It's why you see Barack Obama in New York. Probably Hillary Clinton will win New York, but if he can sink off enough delegates, then -- you know, he's got something there. Same with Illinois. They, in fact, think that New York will cancel out Illinois. His obviously, his home state.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It is interesting that all the four possible presidential hopefuls, all of them are Super Tuesday states. They are from Super Tuesday states.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Right. And so you start out thinking, OK, at least here I can do well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Right. There's a victory somewhere.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Exactly.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Candy, great to see you as always. Thanks.\n\n\n\nJohn? ROBERTS: Coming up, Kiran, to 17 minutes after the hour. Of course, for the last three weeks, we've been crisscrossing the nation, stopping in at diners in small towns and big cities talking to undecided voters. We've got an undecided voter this morning at the Atlanta Diner.\n\n\n\nThis is Trina Hackett. I was saying very famous name in New Zealand. They are the people who invented bungee jumping. And you are about to take a leap today. Cast your vote for -- I assume...\n\n\n\nTRINA HACKETT, UNDECIDED DEMOCRAT: Hillary.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hillary and why is that? You were undecided just a little while ago. What made up your mind here?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I was not truly made my mind. But it's like I'm saying -- more of saying she is very focused and very outstanding with everything that's going on. And more or less, she stands out more because of -- she looks out for the little people. You know -- and she's more focused on the little people. And, you know, and making sure that, you know, that -- life is going to be more easy for them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So what's the number one issue for you in this one?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: The number one issue for me is, more or less, health care. You know, for everyone, that's not being able to afford and everything.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Have you really looked into the differences between the two plans? As we've been saying this morning, there's not that great of difference.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: There's not that great of difference but -- you know, we've seen who is going to stand out. You know, who is going to make it stick. You know, what I mean? Who is going to just really, really just make it known to bring to existence, other than talk about it, but make it realistic.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And do you think -- is that based on experience that she has?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: More to say, yes. Yes. I have seen she's more -- you know, sticking around the people to understand and get to know them more better. Stand beside them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: You know, when we were in California all the way across the country, last week, one of the big issues for people was electability. Who can actually win the White House? Who do you think has the edge on that front?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I would say, Hillary. She's pretty much got it like, you know, hand packed because the more or less, I more saw her face more than I did Obama because -- I mean, I didn't know of him until he just came to run for president. You know, other than that, I was like, I didn't know him at all. ROBERTS: Obviously, she's been around for awhile. Interesting too, though, we should note that the latest polls have got Obama leading by a substantial margin here in Georgia. So if you want Hillary to win, I guess you better get out there and cast your vote.\n\n\n\nTrina Hackett, thanks very much for being with us. It's great to see you. Appreciate it. Get out there and vote today.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So California, across the country again. The big prize in this Super Tuesday on the west coast. What are voters there thinking? We take a cross-country trip coming up to show you.\n\n\n\nAnd the mortgage crisis. We've heard some of the candidates talking about it. What are their plans to fix the situation?\n\n\n\nGerri Willis will be here to tell us all about that, coming up on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Many of the states voting today are states that had been hit hard in the foreclosure crisis. We have been looking at the candidates' plans to fix it. And CNN's Gerri Willis in a hard-hit neighborhood of Atlanta this morning.\n\n\n\nGerri, what are you finding there?\n\n\n\nGERRI WILLIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey there, John. Yes, I'm in an Atlanta neighborhood where the foreclosures are highest. This zip code has the highest number of foreclosures in this city. Check out this house right behind me. It's bank-owned as you can see. Now, John, this is a largely working class community, if you can take a look at down the street here. Of the 85 homes on this street alone, some 24 are in foreclosure or have been in foreclosure.\n\n\n\nNow, the neighborhood leaders are trying to take back the community. They say much of the problem here has been the result of mortgage fraud. And John, as you've been saying all morning, of course, what's going on here is going on across the country in Super Tuesday states all over the country. No place has been hit harder than California where 1 in 52 homes is in foreclosure. Big number there. And they've lost as much as $61 billion in values in homes but also tax revenues. Lost tax revenues.\n\n\n\nAs you know, the industry provides incredible tax revenues for local governments. Other states affected here as well. You can see Colorado. We've mentioned Georgia, Arizona and Illinois.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. So we know how the scope of the problem here, Gerri, because you've been doing some great reporting on it. But what are the candidates planning to try to do to fix it? WILLIS: Well, the person who's probably been most outspoken on the mortgage meltdown is probably Hillary Clinton. She came out with legislation last year to try to clean up the problem. She wanted the big bailout, actually, to solve the issue. Here's what she said recently about what should be done.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes. And I want to freeze interest rates for five years.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWILLIS: Freeze interest rates so the people could actually work their way out of these adjustable rate mortgages which have been so difficult for folks.\n\n\n\nAlso, Obama, has also been outspoken on this topic, also introduced legislation. He wants a $10 billion bailout for the issue and he also wants to make sure that people get mortgage tax credits whether they itemize or not.\n\n\n\nNow the Republicans have been very insistent on no government. They bailout of the folks in this crisis. They think private sector solutions are the best. One little bit difference there, one change, John McCain has opened the window to some possible Federal government involvement, if the issue isn't solved by the president's current plans that are working their way through communities all across the country.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right, Gerri Willis for us this morning. Gerri, thanks very much. Now back to Harlem and here's Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You know, there were nearly 16 million registered voters in California. What's most important to them as they choose a candidate this morning? We're on the road, taking a road trip to find out.\n\n\n\nAlso, Kevin Everett, the Buffalo Bills player defied the odds in his recovery from what was describes as a catastrophic collision on the field. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the medical milestones that Kevin's made.\n\n\n\nHey, Sanjay.\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Kiran. A spinal cord injury is what he had. A lot of people have heard of that. But why do some people get to walk away when so many others don't. I'll break it down for you and tell you what help Kevin. AMERICAN MORNING is coming right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We're back from the Atlanta Diner this morning in Atlanta, Georgia. A big Super Tuesday state. This is the big prize in the south. 87 Democratic delegates available. 72 on the Republican side. And people came in this morning for some eggs and grits and headed out to cast their vote. Welcome back to AMERICAN MORNING. February 5th, Super Tuesday. I'm John Roberts in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Hey, good to see you, John. We're here at the Adam Clayton Powell School in Harlem, New York. Of course, New York another huge state on this Super Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates up for grabs, especially on the Democratic side. We've seen people trickling in and out of here 2 1/2 hours ago, is when the polls opened. It's going to be a busy day not only here but at polling sites across the nation because it is Super Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAnd it's as close as we'll come to a national primary. There are 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates for the Republicans and 1,681 delegates available for the Democrats. There's a look at the big picture map. People are already starting to line up across the northeast. Let's take a look at some of the places. How about West Hartford, Connecticut, Fort Lee, New Jersey, and also across the river from here in queens. We'll be checking back with voters as well as our reporters who have you covered from coast to coast this morning.\n\n\n\nGetting back to New Jersey now. Polls have been open there for about 2 1/2 hours as well. There are 52 delegates at stake for republicans in New Jersey. 127 for democrats and the race is special. Independent voters are allowed to cast ballots. For example, here in New York, they cannot. The closed primaries in New York state. The candidates are aiming for some of those independents. Jason Carroll is at a polling station in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to break it down for us this morning. Hi, Jason.\n\n\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: And hello to you, Kiran. You know, if you are an independent and you show up here at a fire station like this, which is a polling place, that's why you hear the alarms going off. It is a working fire station, Kiran. But it is a polling place. But if you are an independent that shows up here, you have to declare either democrat or republican before you can cast your vote. The democratic race here much too close to call. Senator Barack Obama campaigned in east Rutherford yesterday where he was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy. It's the second major rally that he has attended in northern New Jersey within the past month.\n\n\n\nSenator Clinton supporters say that she has a slight lead here in the state. Even so, she dispatched Chelsea Clinton out to do some campaigning for her on the republican side. Senator John McCain has a double-digit lead over Romney in the state but McCain still stopping through Trenton yesterday to do some last-minute campaigning. Romney sending out his son to do campaigning in the state as well. As you know, Kiran, New Jersey actually moved its primary up so they could have more impact on the presidential nominee. We spoke to some voters this morning about how that's impacting them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of sad when years past when you feel like your vote doesn't count.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a different year than usual. There are a lot of choices. And it seems that it would really make a difference.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of issues domestically we have to take care of. So with that, I think it makes it more important than ever.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCARROLL: And Kiran, we took our own informal poll about the top issues facing some of the voters here in New Jersey. The top two issues they said - number one, the economy; number two, the need for change. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Jason Carroll in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, this morning. Thank you.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, by the way, already cast her vote this morning. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted just minutes ago in Westchester county, the hometown of Chappaqua, about 30 miles north of us here in Harlem. Earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, I talked to her about some of the problems with the economy and asked what she would do to fix them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Another huge issue for people and that's the economy, recession. Some people argue we're already in one. Others say we need to pass some sort of stimulus plan and quickly to avoid one if that's the case. Right now, the House has a version. You're going to be heading back to Washington to vote on a Senate version. And meanwhile, there is talk that perhaps the longer this takes, the less effective it is. What would you do right now to try to stem the economic troubles we seem to be getting into?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I would have a very aggressive policy toward trying to stop home foreclosures. Again, I'm the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year. We need to put a moratorium on foreclosures to help people stay in their homes and we need to freeze these interest rates that continue to escalate, driving more and more people into foreclosure. A lot of people were misled. They were the victim of predatory lending practices, and we need to stabilize the housing market.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Senator Clinton also said she thinks the country is on the brink of a recession. And the Senate must get a stimulus plan through as a first step. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on 34 minutes after the hour, Kiran, Senator Barack Obama is heading back to his hometown of Chicago for a rally tonight. We had a chance to speak with him in the last hour of AMERICAN MORNING, talk about issues like Iraq and the difference between his health care plan and Senator Clinton's.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: She suggests you are falling short here by mandating coverage for children but not mandating it for their parents. What do you say?\n\n\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's break down what she really means by a mandate. What's meant by a mandate is that the government is forcing people to buy health insurance and so she's suggesting a parent is not going to buy health insurance for themselves if they can afford it. Now, my belief is that most parents will choose to get health care for themselves and we make it affordable.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: In an Obama White House, what would that strategic relationship with Iraq look like?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think, first of all, it will not have us setting up permanent bases and a permanent occupation in Iraq for decades which is what George Bush's suggested but also John McCain. I think it is important for us to say to the Iraqis that we are willing to help them. We want to be partners with them, but we are not going to be there in perpetuity. And I have been very clear. I will end this war. We will get combat troops out. I hope to do it by the end of 2009.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Senator Obama also refused to say whether he'd join a combined ticket with Hillary Clinton. He said his focus now is winning the nomination and then trying to unite the country.\n\n\n\nWell, California is a big piece of the puzzle today. Polls opened at 7:00 Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern and the republicans going after 170 delegates for the democrats' 370 are at stake. And there is no winner take all. Delegates will be awarded by congressional district making it a lot more -- making it more like a lot of mini elections instead of just one big one. So what issues are driving the voters? Our Chris Lawrence hit the road to find out. He is live for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, good morning.\n\n\n\nCHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. You know, 1 out of every 8 Americans lives in California. That gives you an idea of the sheer size of this primary. And the voters here are making their decisions based on immigration, health care and most of all, the economy.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE (voice-over): 80 miles east of L.A., Betty Larkins is packing up. After the bank foreclosed on her home.\n\n\n\nBETTY LARKINS: People are saying something about a recession might come. To me, we're in one.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty beat cancer, but she's losing her home because she went broke paying hospital bills.\n\n\n\nLARKINS: See, I didn't even know what it cost for a mammogram until I didn't have insurance.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Based on her health care plans, she's narrowed it down to Obama and Clinton.\n\n\n\nLARKINGS: But I have to pray about it a lot before I make my decision.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty is just one member of the country's most diverse electorate. And California is super Tuesday's biggest prize. There are more people living in Los Angeles county than the entire state of Michigan. We wanted to hear from even more of California's nearly 16 million registered voters, and they are spread out all over the state.\n\n\n\nDriving hundreds of miles to the more agricultural area around Fresno, we found problems for one front-runner.\n\n\n\nJOE MENDOZA, UNDECIDED VOTER: McCain is wishy washy.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Joe Mendoza hasn't decided which other republican he'll vote for.\n\n\n\nMENDOZA: Immigration is a big factor with me right now. To see what they are going to do. This country can't keep sending all our jobs off.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: The next day, we're back on the road to the Bay Area where all that Clinton-Obama advertising has some new company.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, the GOP is awarding delegates to the winner in each congressional district. So republican candidates are campaigning in heavily democratic areas like San Francisco because even a small number there could deliver a win.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you are more part of the process.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: This registered republican is voting for Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Iraq is going to take care of itself with the surge. It's working. But I care about people who are going to actually create jobs. Keep taxes down so that companies can grow.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Yes, one thing about California, a lot of the voters, in fact perhaps half of the voters will vote by absentee ballots. A lot of us who live here, our friends and our family, have already voted. With that in mind, two things to keep in mind today. Barack Obama's late surge and Mitt Romney's conservative challenge to John McCain. How much effect will they really have on the vote totals? John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: It's really becoming an incredibly tight race there. Chris Lawrence for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, thanks. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: A lot of people may still have, John, last-minute questions about the candidates. Not sure where to go to vote today or exactly who they're going to vote for. We have the most up-to-the- minute information for you. Super Tuesday information just ahead.\n\n\n\nAnd also, we see the amazing story of Kevin Everett of the Buffalo Bills. The progress he has made after a spinal cord injury that first was described as catastrophic. How did he and his doctors do it? We're paging our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Oh, hey, we're back. We're back here at the Adam Clayton Powell Elementary, one of the voting sites here in New York today. There's a pretty healthy turnout so far. Polls open here about 6:00 Eastern time. It opened for a little more than 2 1/2 hours right now. Steady stream of people. We wanted to talk to some of the voters and see why they chose the way they did this morning. And joining us is Khalid Kamau. He recently transplanted from Atlanta. You said you were tired of living in a red state. You wanted to move to New York. You work for a non-profit organization right here in Harlem. Tell us a little bit about what went into picking a candidate today.\n\n\n\nKHALID KAMAU, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Well, my roommates and I, we all watched all the debates. We're like tivoing and going back and forth. But just listening to the positions was really - I really felt I can say who I voted for - Hillary - I just felt on the issue that was most important to me, which was health care and several other issues. She really articulated a very detailed position. And, you know, I was really torn, especially after the whole like South Carolina debacle with like Barack and Bill, but --\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Did that turn you off a little what went on in South Carolina, the issues of race?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Yes, it definitely did. I mean, just I think that everyone, you know, would love to see a president or an executive that looks like them. You know, in representative government that's true representation. But I really just felt that she just had a little bit better articulation of some of the issues that were really important, you know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: When you talk about that, this is an issue that Barack Obama himself has talked about and said, I don't really want this to be an issue of race. I don't want people to vote for me just because I could be the first black president. Were those issues of race something that you -- that you took into consideration?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Oh, yes, of course. You can't - I think as much as and you hear a lot of pundits, even reporters saying - you know, talk about how Barack transcends race. I just, we're not there as a country yet where we can just transcend. We can't vote for Barack and the past 400 years of history would like all be fixed. And it's the same thing with, I think, sexism and Hillary Clinton. So it really -- that's always just going to play a huge part.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: But for you, it came down to the individual person and what they were proposing to make your life better?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: It is really is. It really came down to health care. And I just think that we have to - I think Hillary is right when she says that we have to try to cover everyone. You know we have to at least start there.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It's interesting because your mother actually voted for Barack Obama. So you guys had healthy debates over the dinner table?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: She did. We were actually a Hillary family. My mother and father. We were all very pro-Hillary. I think everything kind of turned in South Carolina. And I didn't know actually until this morning when I called her that she changed her vote. But I think that it's just - I don't know. It's just really a profound thing. I think a lot of people are even split with the delegates. I think that every year, every election cycle, it seems like they are finding out some new critical piece of this elaborate election mechanism.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: That's right. But every vote counts. And you certainly cast yours for Hillary. Khalid Kamau, thanks so much for joining us. And you know, it's very interesting, John, just how informed people are for this primary and for this upcoming general election. As you heard from Khalid, he watched every debate, tivoed it if he didn't see it. And that is what we're hearing from a lot of voters. They want, they're hungry for the type of information and they know that they're taking part in an historical decision. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Yes. All you have to do is look at the ratings for our debates to know that people have really been dialed in. We talked to so many people across the country and they are so excited on the republican side and the democratic side about participating in this election.\n\n\n\nWe've been talking about the incredible recovery of Kevin Everett from the Buffalo Bills. Just five months after suffering a spinal cord injury during the Bills' home opener. Kevin Everett is walking again now. He told Kiran it's a recovery that no one would have predicted.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEVIN EVERETT, BUFFALO BILLS: That's my collar.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Unfortunately, we had a little problem with that. But he said people didn't give him much of a chance to recover and he came back. How did Everett and his doctors do it? We're paging Dr. Sanjay Gupta for that. Sanjay joins us now. How did they do it?\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's not sure exactly what happened here. There's obviously a lot of people have spinal cord injuries who never recover the way he did. But I tell you, he's a pretty happy guy there. Dominik Hickson, by the way, who tackled him is very happy guy as well because Kevin is walking. We know several things about his recovery. One is that he got a very early surgery. His operation was quickly. That's important. He also got this therapy, known as hypothermic therapy, actually cooling his spinal cord, cooling his body. Although it's unclear exactly when that was instituted. But take a look at the timeline here. Now, the operation and the injury at the end of September. He had the operation within ten days, he was in a rehabilitation facility. Within week two, he was able to take some steps with a walker. Within week three, standing on his own. By October 30th, he was getting out of bed and eventually on November 18th, he was discharged. So pretty speedy recovery, John. But again, out of which of those things actually made the difference? It's really unclear.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Why did he recover when so many others don't?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Well, you know, you talk about this hypothermic therapy, which is essentially cooling the spinal cord. A lot of people say that's just anecdotal. There's no sort of scientific evidence that works. In his case in particular, what we know is that he got the hypothermic therapy started after the surgery, according to the neurosurgeon who took care of him. So, it's hard to say if that made a difference. He also had a central cord injury, John. It's a type of spinal cord injury from which a lot of people do recover. In fact, in his age group, over 90% of people do recover to some extent.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: How has that different from the debilitating type of injury like Christopher Reeve's?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Right, you're talking about complete spinal cord injury where the entire spinal cord is crushed to some extent. In Kevin Everett's case, according to his rehab doctors, he suffered more of a central spinal cord injury where it's more of a bruising. Think of it as a bruising to the spinal cord where the central most fibers of the spinal cord are the most damaged. The crucial thing there is, John, if you follow those patients over time, a lot of them do recover as long as they have the surgery and the time.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And you should know all about this, Mr. Neurosurgeon.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Obviously, happy for him. He'll walk again. Hard to say if he'll play football again but he's going to walk again.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: He said he's going to get into some businesses and see how it goes after that. Sanjay, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: CNN NEWSROOM just minutes away now. Heidi Collins down the street at the CNN Center with a look at what's ahead.

John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So will weather affect voter turnout on this super Tuesday? There's some bad weather moving into parts of the country. Our Rob Marciano checking it out for us this morning from the CNN weather center just down the street. Good morning, Rob.\n\n\n\nROB MARCIANO, CNN, METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John. Yes, we got a big storm that's running across the country. It's going to bring the gamut as far as weather is concerned through a number of states holding their primaries and caucuses. Kansas, Oklahoma, you'll be under the gun for snow. And after some morning rain and thunderstorms and severe thunderstorms expected across Arkansas and through the mid-Mississippi River Valley, western parts of Tennessee, we could very well see damaging winds and violent tornadoes, especially in Arkansas. Where the storm's prediction center has just upgraded their outlook for today to a high-risk area. That is very rare for this time of year, especially this far north.\n\n\n\nThe main reason, among other things. We got strong winds at the midlevels. We got a lot of heat, 67 Little Rock. 69 degrees in Dallas. And a lot of cold behind that. 32 degrees in Amarillo and 17 degrees right now in Denver, Colorado. So cold mixing with the warm and you got the fireworks, that's for sure.\n\n\n\nWe have severe thunderstorm watch out for north Texas. Likely a tornado watch issued in about an hour for Arkansas and behind the system we have snow. Eastern Colorado through Kansas back through Illinois. Winter storm warnings are posted for several inches of snow possible and then storms extend towards the east coast. Looks like it will be wet for much of New York state. A lot of action. A lot of bad weather to folks heading to the polls. Don't let it discourage you. It will be gorgeous here in parts of the southeast. But if you have some weather to deal with, tell the folks to get out there and get it done.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Boy, bundle up in Colorado today. Rob, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: All right.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Quickly now to what CNN NEWSROOM is working on for the top of the hour.\n\n\n\nCOLLINS: See these stories in the CNN NEWSROOM.

{"comment_2": "Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases? http://t.co/aN9U2jJy6u via @PolitiFact", "target": "real", "comment_1": "@18TruckaMan @MsRock4Ever @proudchicagoan @mobygrapefan @EnigmaNetxx @ItsAlinajo @bkgut3 @ManerdM @keriRN\u2026 https://t.co/UCJzAE2Yaw", "article": "As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.\n\n\"One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,\" CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O\u2019Malley group.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,\" said the attack, which first aired June 25. \"Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (\"Bernie Sanders, gun nut\") as well as conservative glee (\"Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut\"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.\n\nThe Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)\n\nBut before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:\n\n\u2022 In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.\n\n\u2022 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn\u2019t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.\n\n\u2022 After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn\u2019t exist at the time).\n\n\u2022 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\n\n\u2022 The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\nAccording to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.\n\n\"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\"\n\nIn April 1991, Sanders\u2019 then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.\n\n\"Bernie\u2019s response is that he doesn\u2019t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"It\u2019s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\"\n\nThe Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders\u2019 own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.\n\n\"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents\u2019 preferences so does not make gun control a priority.\"\n\n\"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line \u2013 and angering both sides through the years,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. \"Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.\"\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders\u2019 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.\n\nHere are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):\n\nSanders\u2019 moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn\u2019t consider Sanders \"an anti-gunner,\" and he\u2019s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn\u2019t a \"gun lobby lapdog.\"\n\nExperts agreed that on guns, Sanders\u2019 views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.\n\n\"When it comes to guns, he\u2019s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O\u2019Malley or Hillary Clinton,\" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. \"Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don\u2019t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn attack ad said, \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\nThe Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.\n\nExperts noted Sanders\u2019 votes were representative of Vermont\u2019s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "comment_3": "Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases? https://t.co/lLT9ljjNYs via @PolitiFact", "split": "train"}

DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, revolution in the Middle East and the showdown at home over red ink in Washington and in states like Wisconsin . Mounting leadership tests for President Obama as the battle lines of the 2012 campaign come into sharper view. This morning, how will the standoff in Wisconsin end? And is the fight there with the unions about ideology or shared sacrifice?\n\nGOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI): It's not just about the budget now and into the future . It's not just about jobs or workers. This is ultimately about the future of our state .\n\nMR. GREGORY: My guest, the man at the center of the storm , embattled Republican Governor Scott Walker . Also, the future of the Middle East remains in doubt as Libya 's brutal dictator cracks down on protesters.\n\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA: His actions violate international norms and every standard of common decency. This violence must stop.\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's next ? And has the administration done enough? Joining me this morning from the site of such unrest earlier this month, Cairo , Egypt , the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee , Republican John McCain . Then, our political roundtable . What rising oil costs could mean to our own economy . Can Washington avoid a government shutdown over spending? And the rhetorical start to 2012 : Leading Republicans exchanging blows and union activists mobilizing. With us, president of the AFL-CIO , Richard Trumka ; Republican governor of Mississippi and former RNC Chairman , Haley Barbour ; chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Missouri Congressman Emanuel Cleaver ; host of MSNBC 's \" The Last Word ,\" Lawrence O'Donnell ; and editorial board member and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Kim Strassel .\n\nAnnouncer: From NBC News in Washington , MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Good morning. Protests grew in Madison , Wisconsin , Saturday after days of demonstrations there by pro- labor supporters. The standoff started two weeks ago after Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker proposed a budget -balancing bill that would severely limit the rights of most public workers to collectively bargain. The bill would also require them to pay for 12.6 percent of the total cost of their healthcare premiums, and contribute almost 6 percent of their pay toward their pension benefits. Walker 's proposal is an attempt to close the $137 million deficit in this year's state budget , a shortfall that is projected to grow to $3.6 billion in the next two years. And here with us now from Madison , the man in the middle of all this, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker . Governor, welcome to MEET THE PRESS .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Good morning. Good to be with you , David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So that context is important because there's collective bargaining , which you'd like to limit, and there are those -- the specific contributions that you asked the unions. They said they would do that, they would meet those demands. So the question that comes up again and again is, if you want to deal with the budget and the deficit, why not take yes for an answer?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, because we've seen that actions speak louder than words. For us to balance the $3.6 billion deficit we have -- but not only now, but to ensure we can continue to do that in the future so our kids don't inherit these same dire consequences -- we've got to have assurances. And over the past two weeks , even after they made those promises, we've seen local union after local union rush to their school boards , their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care . And, in fact, in one case in Janesville , they actually were pushing through a pay increase. Actions do speak louder than words.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, you could have extended the bill -- you could have extended the bill to those local government agencies. You chose not to.\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, that's just the opposite. I was a local government official for eight years. This bill precisely helps local governments , and it's effective once it passes. In fact, we're, we're facing a $3.6 billion deficit. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're going to have to cut more than a billion dollars from our schools and local governments . You know, in New York and California , where there are Democrats for governors, they're doing that. The difference here is, with this budget repair bill, we give those schools and local governments more -- almost a billion and a half dollars worth of savings. So the savings they get from our budget repair bill exceed the amount...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But...\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...that they're cut from the next state budget .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, but let, let me be clear . If the unions, who, who it seems to me have been clear in saying that they would agree to those extra contributions, if they did that, and you say you're concerned about the budget shortfall, why not accept that?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But what I -- my point is they can't because they -- the two people that suggested it are statewide union leaders. There are a thousand-plus municipalities, there's four -- more than 424 school districts , there's 72 counties. I know -- I used to be a county executive for eight years -- I know that collective bargaining has to be done in every jurisdiction. They can't guarantee that. And the actions of those local unions over the past two weeks show that. If they were serious about it, they would have offered up contracts that, that paid something for health care and something more for pensions. But they're not. The, the reality is, even beyond the five and the 12, collective bargaining does have a cost. In Wisconsin , a great example of that is, we have, in many of our school districts , a requirement through collective bargaining contracts that they have to buy their health insurance from a company that's owned by our state teacher's union , WA Trust . Because of that, it costs them up to $68 -- $68 million more than if they could just buy it from the state employee healthcare plan. Those are real costs about putting real money in the classroom instead of into these collective bargaining agreements. And, for me, at the, at the county level...\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's one -- Governor, let me just stop you.\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...I tried to avoid layoffs.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what, what's wrong with collective bargaining ? Let's be clear . So unions organize public employees. They're able to bargain, not just about wages, but also about health benefits and pension benefits. What you're trying to do is say no, you can just collectively bargain when it comes to how much you make, but not those other benefits.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's so wrong with that, collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today. Under Barack Obama , he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for, for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has. And, in fact, most federal employees...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But I asked you a more specific question, which is what's wrong with collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, for us it's, it's about the fact that, again, as a local official, I can tell you personally time and time again because of collective bargaining when we had tough budgets in the past, when I was at the county presiding as the CO there, I tried to do modest changes of pension, I tried to do modest changes in health care . In fact, one year I literally tried to do a 35- hour work week to try and avoid massive layoffs and furloughs, and the union said, \"Forget it.\" Embodied, emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements, they said, \"Go ahead. Literally lay off 400 or 500 people.\" And to me, laying off people in this economy is just completely unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me ask you about...\n\nGOV. WALKER: If we do not get these changes and the Senate Democrats don't come back, we're going to be forced to make up the savings in layoffs. And that, to me, is just unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I don't mean to -- we have a satellite delay here, it sometimes gets us to bump up against each other. But I want to focus on inconsistencies in some of your argument. You do have exemptions here. You've said, \"We're going to pass this bill, but if you're a cop or a firefighter you don't have to make those extra contributions and you can still collectively bargain.\" You seem to be picking winners and losers. Cops and firefighters don't have to join this. Are they more important than a teacher who spends six hours a day with children in Wisconsin ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, this is not a value judgment about employees, but it is ultimately about preserving public safety . We saw two weeks ago, when this debate first started, teachers here in Madison walked off the job for three days. Now, that was an inconvenience for a lot of parents. I know I've got two public -- kids in public school . Anytime you have a disturbance like that, it's an inconvenience. But that, contrasted to the fact that even if there was one jurisdiction across the state where firefighters or police officers weren't on the job in full force , I can't afford to have a fire or crime committed where there's a gap in service. And it ultimately just boils down to public safety .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, but again, if you're talking about austerity, and you want to deal with this budget deficit , doesn't there have to be a sense of shared sacrifice, that everybody gets hurt?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, there is. I'm a -- well, I'm affecting my family about this, the legislature , my Cabinet -- in fact, as elected officials , we'll pay a higher dollar amount, a higher percentage because of these changes, to show that we're that serious about it. Now, the, the statewide firefighters union president has come out and said they'd take the five and the 12. I would suggest to every mayor out there that they take them up on that. But in terms of making that change, I can't afford to have a gap when it comes to public safety . I think that's the one thing universally, Republican and Democrat alike, liberal or conservative, that people know that we cannot have a gap in, and that's why we made that change in the bill.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You were the subject of a crank call , a liberal blogger who was trying to draw you into, to a conversation about all of this.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and you had a serious conversation, not knowing who you were talking to. And you talked about Ronald Reagan ...\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...and him taking on the unions and the air traffic controllers . And you talked about putting this moment in some kind of context. This is part of what you said.\n\nGOV. WALKER: In Wisconsin 's history -- little did I know how big it would be nationally -- in Wisconsin 's history I said, \"This is our moment , this is our time to change the course of history.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Change the course of history.\" And this is where critics say, you know, this governor is really more of an ideologue than someone who wants to solve a serious problem . You're going farther than other Republicans who have taken on pension and healthcare costs to really go active -- after collective bargaining . And by your own admission, you're saying, \"Well, there's some areas where we just can't afford that level of austerity.\" But if you're serious about austerity, doesn't it have to be a situation where everybody gets affected?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, in the end, the reason I made that comment, I do believe that this is our moment in Wisconsin 's history. It's one of those where, for year after year after year, not just the last governor, but governors before, legislatures before, have kicked the can. They've taken one-time fixes to push the budget problems off into the future . We can't do that. We're broke. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're broke. And it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state and said, \"Here's our problem . Here's the solution,\" and acted on it. Because, if we don't, we fail to make a commitment to the future . Our children will face even more dire consequences than what we face today.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, if you, if you say you're broke...\n\nGOV. WALKER: So I, I make no apology for the fact that this is an important moment in time.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, if you're really serious about the state being broke, you have a deal that you could take to get the contributions you need to solve the problem at hand. Why not separate that out from your views about collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But, but, David , my point is repeatedly, as a former local government official, I know that collective bargaining has a cost, and when I'm cutting out more a billion dollars from aid to local governments in this next two-year budget , I need to do what no other governor's doing across the country . They're all cutting. All but a handful are cutting. The difference is where we want to be unique in Wisconsin is we have to give those local governments the tools. And it goes beyond the 5 and the 12 percent. And as I mentioned repeatedly, I don't think we can take that 5 and 12 percent to the bank...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Are you needless dividing your state ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...because unions have shown us the last two weeks that, that they're not going to do it. No. I think, in the end, the best way for us to move forward is for those 14 state senators -- the state assembly did their job, Democrats in the assembly stood up, made their argument, made their case, did what they were elected to do. The assembly passed it. It is now at a point where we want to move forward. It's real simple. Those 14 state senators need to come back and do what they were elected to do, come back here -- they don't have to vote for it, they don't have to support it, but they need to come back and do their job. And when we do, I have every belief that -- the first four, five weeks we're in office, we passed an aggressive agenda that showed that Wisconsin is open for business. Many of those same senate Democrats voted with me on those measures. We can get back to that if they just come back and do the job they were elected to do.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And if they don't -- if they don't, Governor, how does this end?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, I'm an optimist. I'm an eternal optimist. As much as I understand there's passion and that's -- you know, in America , that's great. We can have passion and be civil about it. But, in the end, I believe that those -- at least some of those state senators will come back. If we fail to pass this bill by Tuesday, we lose $165 million worth of savings. If we continue down that path, we start seeing layoffs. I know that was one of the most difficult decisions I ever had to make when I was a county official was considering layoffs. I would go to almost any ends to avoid that. My hope is at least one of those 14 state senators feels the same way.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, final question here, I want to clarify something. In the course of this prank, this crank call that you got.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It was suggested by someone who was a liberal blogger that you might think about planting troublemakers into the crowd. And you said quote, \"We thought about that.\" Is that right? You really thought about trying to bust up physically these protests?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, we thought , as the call continues and I've said repeatedly, we, we rejected that. But we have people all the time who contact us for and against this bill, and you can imagine people with all sorts of ideas and suggestions, and we look at everything that's out there. But the bottom line is, we rejected that because we have had a civil discourse. We've had, you know, a week ago, 70,000 people, we had more than that yesterday, and yet we haven't had problems here. We haven't had disturbances. We've just had very passionate protesters for and against this bill, and that's OK. That's a very Midwestern thing. But we're not going to allow anybody to come in from outside of this state and try and disrupt this debate . They can inform it, but we're not going to allow them to disrupt this debate and take the focus off the real issue here. And the issue is, the people in Wisconsin , particularly those 14 state senators , need to come home and have the debate here in the state Capitol .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Governor Walker , we will leave it there. Thank you very much .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And we'll have much more on this debate coming up in our political roundtable where we will be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka . But first, to discuss the other big story this week, the unrest in the Middle East and the violence in Libya by the regime of Moammar Gadhafi . We want to bring in the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , John McCain , who has been traveling in the Middle East this week, including stops in Tunisia , Lebanon , and Jordan . And he joins us this morning from the very busy Cairo . Senator McCain , welcome.\n\nSEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask you first about Libya and events that are moving very quickly, including the U.S. response. The president has made it clear that he wants Gadhafi to go. His ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , speaking after a vote in the Security Council in favor of sanctions against Libya , imposing an arms embargo, urging member countries to freeze assets of the Gadhafi family. And this is what Ambassador Rice said during that debate .\n\nDR. SUSAN RICE: When a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator, the question is how is that achieved?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with that statement, but I'd also like to point out that we could impose and could have imposed a no-fly zone. They would've stopped flying if that had been imposed. They're using air power and helicopters to continue these massacres. We should recognize a provisional government somewhere in eastern Libya , perhaps Benghazi . We should make it clear that we will provide assistance to that provisional government . And finally, we should make it absolutely clear that anyone who continues or is in engaged in these kinds of barbarous acts are going to find themselves on trial in a war crimes tribunal. We've got to really get tough.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and by get tough, if you talk about a no-fly zone, would you stop short there? I mean, you're, you're certainly raising the specter of some kind of military intervention on the part of the U.S. and its allies to stop Gadhafi to force him to go.\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, I think that providing the so-called provisional government , and there will be one, with the equipment and material that they could use, the no-fly zone, I think would be a very strong signal. I'm not ready to use ground forces or further intervention than that. Look, Gadhafi 's days are numbered. The question is, how many? And how many people are going to be massacred before he leaves one way or the other? I think those measures that I just mentioned could hasten his demise.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask you about Egypt . We have an image of you earlier in the day in Tahrir Square where there are still protesters. The critical question is building -- the building blocks of a democratic government there. How is that going?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's going along. We met with some of the young opposition leaders, these real heroes. I was in awe to be in their company about what needs to happen. There are still significant divisions, but I think they are headed in the right direction. I think there are questions about how soon to have an election , whether to have a presidential election before the parliamentary elections. But I believe that there's every good chance they can succeed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , you're in the region. We're watching what could be called an Arab spring, an historic movement. It's also a game-changing movement for the United States and our interests there. It's my understanding the president has ordered a complete review of Middle East strategy. I know that our defense leaders have also called for instant contingency planning . As you survey the area, how do we reassess both emergencies there and our interests there?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that this winds of change are going to be confined to blowing just in the Arab world and the Maghreb . I think it's going to be all over the world , to wit what's happening in China and in other countries around the world. Second of all, the return to our fundamentals. And that is that all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights . Respect democracy , further it. Recognize that the longer there's a dictatorship, the bigger the explosion is going to be once that people become dissatisfied enough. Recognize that, that we have to assist these countries, and it is in our national interest to do so. And the economy is a vital and the most important permanent part of any successful transition to democracy and freedom. And, frankly, we should've done more in the past. I think we should all admit that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what about contingency planning ? Are there contingencies that may arise now that are particularly worrisome to you?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's not clear where this revolution goes in, in all of these countries, and every country is very different from each other. I think we should understand that Iran can take advantage of this unsettling situations in these countries. We should be standing up for democracy in Iran . We should be backing their protesters with our moral support , which we didn't in 2009 .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask to get your reaction about something that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said this week about U.S. intervention into the Middle East and into Asia . This is what he said at West Point on Friday.\n\nMR. ROBERT GATES: In my opinion, any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa , should have his head examined, as General McArthur so delicately put it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: How do you respond to that, Senator ?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I have the highest regard for Secretary Gates . I think he's one of the finest secretaries of Defense in the history of our country and a great patriot. I think there are times, however, and I'm sure he would say this, where it does require U.S. military intervention. Afghanistan was the genesis of 9/11, as you know. We had to stamp out the situation -- get the situation there under control so that it would not continue to be a base for attacks on the United States and our allies. But I also understand the implications of the needs of a new kind of warfare to counter this radical Islamic extremism wherever it rears its head, particularly in those continents that he referred to.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Finally, Senator McCain , I just wanted to get your reaction to something that came out of Rolling Stone magazine that I'm sure you're aware of this week. Here was a picture with you in Kabul with Lieutenant General William Caldwell , and this is the piece by Rolling\n\nStone featuring him. It says this: \" The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in psychological operations to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned. And when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.\" As you know, General Petraeus is now investigating this. What happened?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, you know, that's been tried on me in the past, David . I don't know what's happened. I do know that the -- General Caldwell is a great leader and has done a great job in leading the Afghan army . I also know that these briefers are briefed, \"You know, Senator\n\nX is interested in the following: A, B, C, D and E.\" And, and that, and that I think is perfectly legitimate. Now, if it went any further than that, I don't know. General Petraeus will make a full investigation. General Caldwell has steadfastly denied it, but I don't see how it could have affected my positions in any way. And so we'll see what happens. But I've, I'm -- put me down as skeptical.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , we will leave it there. Thank you very much and safe travels. And coming up next, as a government shutdown looms, budget battles front and center in the Capitol and in statehouses across the country . Ground zero for it all this week? Wisconsin . What is at stake there? What will it mean for the rights of workers ? And how will it all impact the 2012 race for the White House . Our political roundtable weighs in. We'll be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka ; Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour ; the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Emanuel Cleaver ; MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell ; and The Wall Street Journal 's Kim Strassel .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, what will the budget battles taking place across the country mean for the race for the White House in 2012 . Our roundtable weighs in. It's up next after this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back now with our political roundtable . The president of the AFL - CIO , Richard Trumka ; the Republican governor of Mississippi , former RNC chairman, Haley Barbour ; chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Missouri congressman, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver ; editorial board member and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Kim Strassel ; and the host of MSNBC 's \" The Last Word ,\" Lawrence O'Donnell , who spent a long time on Capitol Hill in the early '90s, including several years as the chief of staff to the Senate finance committee , so he's seen some of these fights before. Welcome to all of you. Mr. Trumka , welcome to the program. You heard Governor Walker . This is an important moment for unions, and as he says it, for taxpayers. How do you respond to what he says?\n\nMR. RICHARD TRUMKA: Well, first of all, this isn't about the budget crisis . Let's look at how this -- his arguments migrated. First he said it was -- the budget crisis was caused because workers were paid too much in Wisconsin . We now have studies that show they're not overpaid, they're underpaid. In fact, people with a degree in Wisconsin get 25 percent less than their private sector things. Then he said it was about the pension. Now we find out that his pension plan , unlike a lot in the country , is almost fully funded. The assets match the liabilities. And then the employees said, or the members out there said, his workers said, \"We'll accept your cuts.\" And he said, \"No. We won't accept your accepting our cuts.\" And the most outrageous thing that he did, and he talked about this, was he's now saying to them, \"You either have to accept a loss of your rights or I'm going to lay you off.\" Now, no person should have to face the right of their loss of their job or the loss of their rights. I know Governor Barbour would never say to his employees, his people down there, \"You either have to give up your rights or you have to give up your job.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me follow up on one point. A lot of people who are following this may be confused but certainly have questions about the role of public sector unions. And there does something that seem, seem to be distorted. You raise a lot of money from public employees. That goes, goes to finance campaigns to try to get somebody in office that you can do business with. And ultimately you're supporting someone, in some cases, that you're ultimately negotiating with. They also know that political employees, rather public employees are politically active because they're organized by the unions. And so they make concessions on things like pensions, on health care , knowing that the promises don't come due to well down the road. Isn't this the cycle that we've gotten into that public unions have to take some responsibility for?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, public employees do take responsibility for it. And those governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can actually work out problems . They -- we can solve them. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. He's saying, \"I won't talk to you. I'll talk to all my, my big contributors.\" He talked to the Koch brothers, he thought . \"But I won't talk to employees.\" Look, the five countries -- or the five states in this country that prohibit collective bargaining by state employees have a collective debt right now of $220 billion. This isn't about employees. This is about the economy .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: What we need to do is create jobs, and that's what we should be doing.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. And we'll get to that.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Working together.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, Governor Barbour , this is the question that I posed at the beginning of the program. Is this, is this an ideologue? Is this just about ideology? Is it about union busting ? Or is it about really getting serious about shared sacrifice?\n\nGOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS): Well, it's about budgets. It is about the fact that Wisconsin , like many states , is broke. And the idea is, \"OK, let's make a very narrow agreement over wages and, and -- for one year is going to solve the problem .\" Governor Walker understands, as every governor understands, it is not enough just to kick the can down the road to next year because these problems snowball. They cascade. And that's why it's critical to get ahold of this. For most states the, well, the pay...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But he -- but his argument is that the unions are so unreasonable, they won't ultimately make concessions. They've made the concession.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: For a year.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's the whole problem . They've got to change the system. About half the states in the country don't allow or limited -- limit collective bargaining . The federal government doesn't have collective bargaining for wages, for health benefits . I mean, this -- people act like this is some right, you know, that these are collective bargaining rights. There's no right to this under the Constitution .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Lawrence O'Donnell , how do you read this?\n\nMR. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL: Well, you know, one of the things I was struck by in your interview with the governor is, just to go back to a point, is that he said that he rejected , rejected the idea of sending in troublemakers to the demonstrations. That means the idea was discussed. That means someone in the governor's office said, \"How about we send some people in there to cause physical trouble in these demonstrations?\" And this governor thought about it, discussed it, rejected it. OK, he rejected it. But to say he rejected it and think, \"Well, that's the end of it, that's a noncontroversial moment ,\" it's quite shocking to think that there was a governor thinking about that.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , you added the word physical. Nobody ever -- you could talk about should you send people out there to talk to the employees?\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: OK, let's, let's just -- OK, I'll, I'll retract that. Let's just say troublemakers. This -- it's, it's shocking to think the governor, among the things they were discussing was, \"Should we send in troublemakers?\" How long did you -- would you have to discuss that?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let met bring in Congressman Cleaver . I mean, you were on this program last month after the shooting of Gabby Giffords . We talked about tone. We talked about inappropriate public discourse . And I want to show you some of the placards that have been used by demonstrators, pro- union supporters out there. They have cast the governor -- this one here, \"One dictator to go, one dictator down,\" talking about Hosni Mubarak . He has been compared to Hitler . We spent time on this program talking about the nonsense about Obama being a Muslim or not being born in America and asking Republicans if they reject that. Should that kind of discourse be rejected in this fight?\n\nREP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO): Absolutely. It's inappropriate. It should be condemned, not only by people close to the governor, but by those of us who are observers. I think that's something that we've got to squash in, in this country . We've come to a, a, a, a point in this government discussion where, you know, one side says, \"Anything goes to get my point across.\" And I , I think it would be certainly something that I would condemn. But, but, but it goes even further than that. We're not even involved in trying to solve the problems . One side proposes, the other side opposes. That's why we're not making progress. The -- you know, the, the governor is saying here, you know, you know, \"You come back, let's, let's prevent me laying off employees.\" If you -- when, when the lion and the lamb lie down, if you look closely, when the lion gets up the lamb is missing. When the governor says, \"Come back home,\" he's not saying, \"Let's negotiate.\" He's saying, \"Come back home so I can do what I want to do to the unions.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Kim Strassel , I want, I want to bring you in on this. And the president said this was an assault on unions.\n\nMS. KIM STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: He's then gone quiet. Back in 2007 on the campaign trail, this is what he said, if this were to ever come to pass.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: And understand this. If American workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when I'm in the White House , I'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself, I'll walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States of America. Because workers deserve to know that somebody's standing in their corner.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So here he said it was an assault on unions. In the past he said, \"I'll be out there walking with you.\" He's now gone silent. Meantime, he's trying to move to the center politically and try to create jobs. He's put himself in a difficult political situation here.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, as the governor says, he needs to have a pair of shoes on picketing around Washington , D.C. , because federal workers are not allowed any of these collectively bargaining rights that he's talking about there. Look, one of the problems here is that I think the problem for Democrats and unions in this is that it's not necessarily a winning issue here. What's going on in the states is a microcosm of the federal debate , and that is about fiscal responsibility right now. What these governors are saying -- and it's Chris Christie in New Jersey , it's Scott Walker in Wisconsin , it's John Kasich in Ohio ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But they're not going as far on collective bargaining , not in New Jersey , not in Indiana .\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Right. But we're talking about the bigger issue about budgets...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...and how you deal with budgets. You even have Democrats like Andrew Cuomo in New York saying, \"When we look at these budgets, huge ballooning areas of these budgets are due to public sector union benefits, and we cannot touch them because of collective bargaining , because of these things. We need the flexibilities and tools to fix this.\" And so that's a, that's an argument that resonates with Americans . People are talking about trying to cast this as the middle -- an assault on the middle class . It was middle -class taxpayers who elected these guys.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, Richard Trumka ...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: They campaigned on it. They elected them, they put them in office to do this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...is, is, is President Obama doing enough? Is he satisfying you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Look, it's important for the president -- for middle class voters to know that the president is on their side.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But this isn't about President Obama .\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, but I'm asking you whether he's doing enough.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor -- wait.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You heard what he said in 2007 .\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor...\n\nMR. GREGORY: He'd be out there with you. He's not out there with you.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: David , this is about a governor who's taken on nurses and EMTs ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mr. Trumka , but answer the question. I asked a very specific question. The president, in 2007 as a candidate, said, \"If this ever happened, I'd be with you.\" Do you think he's with you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I think, I think he's doing it the right way. He's not taking on workers like Scott Walker is...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: ...and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle class way of life. He stands for that. He's doing that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Could he be doing more?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: He could -- everybody could be doing more.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, that's -- but in this particular case. I mean, Lawrence , I want to go back to the politics here. It is very difficult for a president who wants to move to the center to, before the cannon -- you know, after it fired initially he said it's an assault on unions, then he's gone quiet. And now he's, he's, he's got unhappiness on the left and on the right, and he just wants to be more of a centrist guy right now.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: It would be interesting to see what his choice would be if he was in a second term.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: This is someone who won Wisconsin . He has to win Wisconsin again. There is chaos there right now. Politically, he doesn't know how this is going to play three months from now. If a large majority or significant majority of Wisconsin likes the outcome, whatever it is, a few months from now, that's where the president wants to be going into his re- election there.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, you know, talking about...\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: So that's why he's staying out of it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, and I want to talk about the politics some more. Howard Fineman , in The Huffington Post , had an analysis about this and how, in many ways, this is about the GOP 's attempts to win more governor seats around the country . He talks about it, \"The Real Political Math in Wisconsin . What happened?\" Why did Republicans only get 12 this last go-round? \"Well, according to GOP strategists and Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi who chaired the [ RGA ] in 2010 the power and money of public-employee unions was the reason. ... \" The GOP strategic aim is simple enough. If they can abolish union collective-bargaining rights, they can undermine the automatic payment of dues to the public-employee union treasuries. Shrinking those treasuries and reducing the union structure and membership will make it harder for Democrats ... to communicate directly with workers.\"\n\nMR. TRUMKA: There it is.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Now, that's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, that's....\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, no, but...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Do you disagree with him?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Look, this is about -- this is a state issue in a state where they've got serious budget problems because payroll pensions are such a huge part of the budget you got to deal with it , and you can't deal with it for one year. I have some...\n\nMR. GREGORY: This is a national movement , I thought . I thought it was a national movement . OK.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Let's talk about -- you asked about the president.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: The president is one of the greatest politicians in the history of the United States , and he -- and he's quiet because he understands that most Americans know this has to be done.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Congressman, where -- hold on, let me get Congressman...\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Let's sue him for breach of promise and move on. I mean, let's -- you know, the reality is that the, the, the president needs to be in Washington dealing with a plethora of issues around the world, not the least of which is Libya . But I want to go back to something that, that you said actually twice, Governor, and, and that is you said, you know, this is -- would be a one-year agreement. The governor was just elected. He'll still be governor in a year. And, you know, the, the, the agreements that we have were not made by Gadhafi . They were made by people who sat down in a room and worked out a, worked out an agreement. And I think labor unions are saying, and, and public sector employees are saying, \"OK, you know, maybe things have gotten out of balance. We'll, we'll, we'll reduce some things.\" The governor is saying, \"I don't care.\" You know, \"I want to crush the union .\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to, I want to get to a break. Richard Trumka , I want to ask you one thing, again, about the tone of the debate . You're one of the leading labor voices in the country . Do you condemn the hyperbole, the overstatements, comparisons to Hitler and dictators? Do you think that's wrong on the part of pro- union supporters?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We want to -- I -- look, we ought to -- pro, anti- union , it doesn't matter.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It's inappropriate.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We should be sitting down trying to create jobs. When -- and look, if you think that the argument that you're doing in Wisconsin is winning, as you said, Kim , the polls show that every -- Wisconsin , vast majority of the people think this governor has overreached. His popularity has gone down. They're saying to him, \"Sit down and negotiate. Don't do what you've been doing.\" So he's losing. If that's the argument you're going to do this year or next year, it's a loser for, for anybody who advocates it.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: And I don't know why you fear democracy so much. You're saying that this is a temporary agreement. It's a, it's a result of democracy in Wisconsin . Republicans won Wisconsin , and, and the, and Republicans ran on this. And now they're doing this. If the idea remains popular, and if it has democratic support in Wisconsin , meaning support of the democracy of Wisconsin , why would you worry about leaving this agreement out there so that it -- and allowing collective bargaining so that the -- Wisconsin can democratically express itself in the future as being in favor or opposed to more or less government spending on workers?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , it, it is precisely because I do believe in democracy . We had an election in 2010 , and Wisconsin voted for a Republican governor, a Republican senator, two Republican Houses of the legislature , and they have determined this is the best way to go forward to get the budget of that state , in effect, which they were elected to do. Look at Indiana . In Indiana this was done six years ago by the governor. It has been very popular. Nobody put Mitch Daniels ' picture with a, with a crosshair over his face like they're doing in Wisconsin . You know, if Sarah Palin , did that, you know...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...it would be the world coming to an end.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, quick -- Kim , quick point, and then I want to get to a break.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, actually, in fairness, I mean, Governor Daniels was -- did get some blow-back when he did this six years ago.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: And his approval ratings did go down, but the problem -- the question is, what happens in the end? People want to see balanced budgets . And what's interesting is, Governor Daniels is one of the few states , because he ended up with that flexibility in his budget to negotiate, he's had -- been in the black for the past five or six years, even when other states have not.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me get a break in here. I want to talk a little bit about the budget woes here in Washington , as well as what's going on in the Middle East , right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back with our roundtable . Congressman Cleaver , I want to talk about the president's budget and the spending showdown here in Washington . We're actually not talking a great deal about the budget yet because there's this prospect of a government shutdown because Republicans , Democrats can't seem eye to -- see eye to eye on spending for just the rest of this fiscal year. This is a statement that you put out about the president's budget . And I 'll put it up on the screen. \"Rebuilding our economy ,\" you wrote, \"on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans is something I simply cannot accept. ... \"I understand that now is the time for us as a nation to sacrifice in order to protect our children from a certain amount of debt; however, I'm struggling to understand how this budget helps us best to achieve this critical goal. Cutting funding to programs that assist hardworking Americans , help families heat their homes, and expand access to graduate-level education seems to conflict with the notion of winning the future . We cannot win the future by leaving our most vulnerable behind.\" Do we have the balance wrong as we approach spending this year and look ahead to the president's budget ?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Absolutely. Let me, let me preface my comment on that by, by just saying, you know, disagreement does not equal disassociation or disaffection. And disagreement among friends is the insignia of a healthy relationship. We've, we've got to disagree with the president when we think that he's moving in a direction that's disturbing. But, at the same time, I do think that real cuts needs to be made. But, but let's keep in, in mind, you know, I think we're dangerously cutting. Ben Bernanke has warned Congress in, in a hearing that cavernous cuts could hurt what is a rickety recovery. And Goldman Sachs , in, in, in an analysis released last week, said that even if the proposed cuts are reduced to 25 billion for the first year and 50 billion for next year that it would still create a, a 1 percent cut in economic growth of the GDP .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, but, Lawrence , there is a stop-gap measure that looks like it'll head off a shutdown. But then the president's still going to have to engage on the fact that Republicans , Democrats are far apart on these huge cuts Republicans want for this year.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: They are. It looks like they're going to avoid this Friday's possible shutdown and, and have a two week extension. They seem to have agreed on that by John Boehner basically taking the cuts the president has identified in the future and saying, \"Let's start doing them now.\" That, that's the cut package that they will include in their ongoing resolution. But the problem with this dialogue is, it all begins after our failure on recognizing what the top tax rate burdens should really be. And, and keeping them down has created this much more serious deficit situation going forward. We've been ignoring for years the reality of what has happened in the super rich level of income in this country . We should have several higher top tax brackets . It shouldn't stop at a couple of hundred thousand dollars . We have incomes, we have short-stops making $15 million who are paying the same tax rate as, you know, two UCLA married professors. This is outrageous. We have people on Wall Street in deals making $300 million in a day and they pay that same top tax rate as people making a couple of hundred thousand dollars . And so we're ignoring this massive revenue possibility in the high end of incomes in this country .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And as this debate goes on, Kim , you can respond to that, but I also want to talk about another threat to the economy that is coming from the events that we're talking about in the Middle East . I thought this cartoon by Jim Margulies captured it, a syndicated cartoonist. \"The price of liberty,\" he says in the cartoon, \"is $5.00 a gallon.\" And we're talking about Libya , only 2 percent of the oil market, but very important in Europe.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And it's the speculation that causes folks to pay more for gas here. How does this imperil this economy ?\n\nMS. STRASSEL: No, that, that is the real problem , is speculation, at the moment . As you said, Libya is 3 percent of the oil market and you've already had the Saudis come out and say we can replace the oil that's not coming out of Libya . What you're seeing here is, is traders worried that this Arab revolt is going to spread to places like Saudi and they are building in some of that worry into the price . That's why you've seen the spike. This acts as a tax on the economy . You know, every time we -- I think we import 7.5 -- or we use 7.5 billion barrels of oil a year, every time $10 a barrel price hike, that's a huge new tax on the economy . Now, some of this, by the way, I should point out, isn't just Libya and speculation. We're also seeing in here part of Ben Bernanke 's quantitative easing and inflation working its way into oil prices as well.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also seeing, David , the administration's energy policy , which is driving down American oil production . I mean, the shutting down of the Gulf of Mexico , taking lands in Alaska off, the, the issues that they are raising. America 's going to produce about 13 percent more domestic petroleum this year. Now, how is that in our interest at a time like this or at any other time?\n\nMR. GREGORY: You, you talk about that in terms of energy policy as someone who may run for president. And we'll talk more about politics after the break. As you look at the Middle East , what concerns you about U.S. posture toward that region?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, look, I'm one of these guys who believes, as Senator Vandenberg used to say, that in politics, it should stop at the water's edge when it comes to foreign policy . I'm not going to be critical of the administration, but I do think on their domestic energy policy , it is greatly compounding this problem . We're blowing past $3 a gallon, on our way to $4 a gallon, maybe Jim Margulies is right. Four dollar gasoline brought my state and a lot of places to their knees in 2008 before there ever was a meltdown on Wall Street .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me, let me get another break in here. We'll come back, talk politics for 2012 and what Wisconsin means for that and a couple of other topics, when we come back with our roundtable right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our final moments with our roundtable . Everything has political implications. Let's talk about the politics. The news this week for 2012 , Senator Thune has decided that he will not run for president, John Thune , from South Dakota . And you look at the Gallup Poll and here's the list, this crowded field. Huckabee and Romney look to be at the top. And there's Governor Barbour at 3 percent. And, Governor, as you look at this, and this -- the field continues to be unsettled, how will you make the calculation about whether you'll run.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: I didn't know my family was that big, 3 percent. It's a, it's a very critical decision . It's a family decision in many ways. In fact, in most ways. But I'm not going to make a decision until April. I'm going to finish my legislature , get my job done, get my budget passed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But how do you decide -- but how to make that calculation based on what you're seeing?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Because there seems to be a lot of late entries here.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Whether or not anybody else runs is irrelevant to my decision. I'm going to make the decision based on things that I think. And I don't want to take everybody else 's time going through all the things that I would have to think...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...that I am thinking about.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Richard Trumka , how do you assess that Republican field right now, who you'll be organizing against?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, they'll be a lot of them, probably.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Is there a front-runner?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I, we'll...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you, who's most formidable in your mind?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I don't know. I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go there on either side, the Democrats or Republicans . That's a debate that needs to take place. But, you know, Governor Walker what he's done and people like him, governors like him, they've energized the working class voters. And that momentum that we've picked up, the demonstrations that you're seeing in Madison isn't just in Madison . They're around the country . And that momentum is going to continue on. And, Haley , I hope you don't stake your whole campaign on taking away the right of workers to be able to earn a middle class income, because I don't think that's a winner for you at this time.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, I want to stake my campaign on the right of taxpayers to be able to pay so that the state employees can keep their jobs and don't have to be laid off.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let, let, let me ask you...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Those state , those state , those state workers are taxpayers.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask about, about, about health care , Lawrence O'Donnell . As Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , who has taken on Mitt Romney , this is what he said in the Associated , Associated Press , as they covered it. \" Huckabee said Wednesday that potential White House rival Romney should offer an apologize for healthcare overhaul that he oversaw as Massachusetts governor .\" Quoting him, \"I think it's not a killer for him, but he has to say either 'I love it,' 'I hate it,' or, 'Hey, I tried it, it didn't work and that's why I should say to you let's not do it nationally.'\" He goes on, \"He's got to figure out how he wants to deal with it . It's the 800-pound elephant in the room for him.\" Now, Romney has stood by it, but said it's something that the states should work out.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: Well, Huckabee is right in identifying this is what's wrong with the Romney candidacy. And, in fact, you can go down through the list and do that with pretty much every one of the possible Republican candidates, with the exception of Tim Pawlenty , who I think is the one who is going to start moving ahead because he has no serious negative. You have thoughtful Republicans starting to support him. The ideal candidate is a Midwesterner , and that usually is true for both parties because that's where the battleground states are. With Thune dropping out, Pawlenty becomes more important in the field. But Romney has the same- -this is identical, virtually identical politically to the problem Hillary Clinton had going into that primary field , where she had to disown or own the vote in support of the Iraq war . This is much more serious. The, the, what, what Romney did on health care is much more difficult thing to overcome in the primaries. I don't think he can.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: I think that's not, not alone. I actually, that's not the only issue. And I actually agree with Richard here that what is happening in Wisconsin is going to have very big implications for the, the primaries on both sides, and in particular in this case, because the other 800-pound gorilla in the room, besides health care , is fiscal responsibility .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: You see the president entirely focused on it at the moment . And this is going to play into Republican governors...\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, Congressman...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...in particular who are running and their record in the states .\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...are, are Republicans running circles around Democrats and the president on the issue of fiscal responsibility , from the states to cutting in Washington ? Is that how you view it?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: No, absolutely not. The -- what, what the Republicans are mistakenly doing is pushing cuts that will hurt the very people who voted for them. And when people realize what is happening to them and their families, there will be, I think, a great deal of buyers regret, and we'll look up and see that President Obama is surging again. To, to beat somebody, you got to run somebody. This is the only person that I'm endorsing to run against Barack Obama at the moment .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah. Really? You'd endorse Governor Barbour .\n\nREP. CLEAVER: To run against Barack Obama.\n\nMR. GREGORY: To run against him, OK.\n\nREP. CLEAVER: You know, David ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're going to, we're going to have to leave it there. We're out of time. Thanks to all of you. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss an endorsement there.

{"comment_2": "Everything you need to know about the #drone debate. Nicely done by WaPo. http://t.co/dnphCf9sH8", "target": "real", "comment_1": "RT @drones: Everything you need to know about the drone debate, in one FAQ http://t.co/COvRmR0JIP", "article": "This is well outside Wonkblog\u2019s normal bailiwick, but if nothing else, Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s (R-Ky.) filibuster against CIA director nominee John Brennan \u2014 launched as a protest against the administration\u2019s drone policy, which Brennan has steered for the past four years \u2014 uncovered a hunger for a broader conversation on the topic. So what does the drone program actually entail, and why are Paul and others criticizing it?\n\nWhat is a drone?\n\nTechnically called \u201cunmanned aerial vehicles\u201d (UAVs), drones are just aircraft without human pilots onboard, encompassing everything from reconnaissance vehicles to unmanned crop dusters. In common parlance, though, \u201cdrone\u201d has come to refer to unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), which are UAVs equipped with combat capabilities, most commonly the ability to launch missiles.\n\nHow long has the U.S. government been using them?\n\nThe General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, the most famous UCAV in the U.S. arsenal, first saw combat in 1995 as part of the NATO intervention in Bosnia, but at that time was solely a reconnaissance tool and carried no payload. On Feb. 16, 2001, the Predator #3034 became the first to be successfully fitted with a Hellfire missile, and to fire it in a trial flight. Predators were deployed to Afghanistan almost immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and on Oct. 7, 2001 they conducted their first armed mission there.\n\nIn addition to the Predator, the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a larger UCAV capable of carrying a higher payload, has seen service starting in 2007. The current program is jointly administered by the CIA and the Joint Special Operation Command (JSOC).\n\nWhere do we send them?\n\nPrimarily Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. According to a Washington Post database, compiled with the help of the New America Foundation and Long War Journal, strikes in Pakistan have been occurring since 2004 and picked up in pace starting in summer 2008. Apart from a November 2002 strike in Yemen, the Somalia and Yemen campaigns began in 2011. There have been reports of strikes in the Philippines, though information there is sketchy.\n\nAdditionally, drones have seen service in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Unites States\u2019s more traditional military campaigns in those countries.\n\nHow powerful is a drone attack?\n\nPredator drones can carry up to two Hellfire missiles. Those have warheads of about 20 pounds, which are designed to pierce tank armor; their damage outside of the vehicle targeted is limited. An alternative warhead, which manufacturer Lockheed Martin touts as featuring \u201chigh lethality and minimum collateral damage,\u201d also is in service.\n\nReapers are another story. They feature a maximum payload of 3,000 pounds, or 1.5 tons. That means they can carry a combination of Hellfires and larger 500 pound bombs like the GBU-12 Paveway II and GBD-38 JDAM. Those have an \u201ceffective casualty radius\u201d of about 200 feet. That means that about 50 percent of people within 200 feet of the blast site will die. Those odds improve \u2014 or worsen, depending on how you look at it \u2014 the closer you get, obviously.\n\nSo imagine if you took a football field and shrunk it by a third. A Reaper attacks one endzone with a GBU-12. If you\u2019re on the field, you have a 50 percent chance of dying. Update: I apparently forgot the distinction between yards and feet since middle school. Corrected.\n\nHow many drone attacks have we launched to date?\n\nAccording to the Post database, there have been 347 in Pakistan, 53 in Yemen and 2 in Somalia. From 2008 through October 2012, there were 1,015 strikes in Afghanistan, 48 in Iraq, and at least 105 in Libya according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. That does not include strikes in Libya past September 2011, strikes from 2001 to 2007 in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those since October 2012. The New York Times\u2019 Mark Mazzetti reported that at least one strike has happened in the Philippines.\n\nWhat sort of people have we targeted?\n\nPrimarily al-Qaeda and its affiliates. That includes al-Shaabab in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (which works in Yemen), and the Haqqani Network in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Philippines strike was intended to kill Umar Patek, a leader of the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah who helped orchestrate the 2002 attacks in Bali that killed 95 people. Patek is now serving a 20-year sentence in Indonesia.\n\nHave we killed U.S. citizens this way?\n\nWe\u2019ve killed four, at least. Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born al-Qaeda operative in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in 2011, as was his American-born 17-year-old son (in a subsequent strike) and Samir Khan, a North Carolina native who died in the same strike as the elder al-Alaki. Ahmed Hijazi, also an American citizen based in Yemen, was killed in 2002. Note: paragraph updated to correct spelling of al-Awlaki\u2019s name and include Hijazi.\n\nTo clarify the Obama administration\u2019s exact policy on killing Americans without a trial, Eric Holder wrote the following letter to Sen. Rand Paul: \u201cDear Senator Paul: It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: \u2018Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?\u2019 The answer to that question is no.\u201d The dispatch followed an earlier, more equivocal note from Holder on the subject, which seemed to indicate Holder believes the president has the authority to kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if he judges them a threat.\n\nHow many people have died in drone attacks?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham estimated the death toll of the Pakistan/Somalia/Yemen program at 4,700. That\u2019s higher than most estimates; Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations puts the number at closer to 3,500.\n\nHow many of those were civilians?\n\nCora Currier at ProPublica helpfully compiled a number of estimates in January. New America puts the civilian death total in Pakistan and Yemen between 276 and 368, of which 118-135 were under the Bush administration. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number between 446 and 978, increasing to 993 if you include Somalia. Of those, 179 to 209 were children, BIJ estimates. A Stanford/NYU study suggests that the strikes have inflicted considerable psychological trauma on residents of Pakistan, and deterred relief workers from serving areas targeted. Funerals and rescue workers have been targeted in past strikes.\n\nWhat\u2019s the process for deciding when and where to launch them?\n\nAs my colleague Greg Miller has reported, the administration uses something called the \u201cdisposition matrix\u201d to determine targets for drone strikes. Miller describes it as a \u201csingle, continually evolving database in which biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations are all cataloged. So are strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols\u2026The database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an operational menu that spells out each agency\u2019s role in case a suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot.\u201d\n\nThe National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) will prepare lists of potential targets, which will be reviewed every three months by a panel of intelligence analysts and military officials. They are then passed along to a panel at the National Security Council, currently helmed by CIA director nominee Brennan, and then to Obama for final approval. The criteria for addition to the list are determined personally by Obama, who also must personally approve all strikes outside Pakistan. Pakistan strikes are approved by the CIA director.\n\nWhat\u2019s the case for using drones?\n\nThere\u2019s some political science to suggest that \u201cdecapitation strikes,\u201d like these drone attacks, are actually quite effective at reducing the ability of terrorist groups to operate effectively. The RAND Corporation\u2019s Patrick Johnston and UCLA\u2019s Anoop Sarbahi have found preliminary evidence that the drone program specifically is effective at degrading the operations of targeted groups. Zack Beauchamp has a good overview of this literature here.\n\nBut that\u2019s a case for strikes, not for drone strikes specifically. There is, however, substantial evidence that the percentage of casualties borne by civilians is much lower with drone strikes than with just about any other kind of military intervention, even if one accepts high estimates of the percent of killed who are civilians.\n\nIs Congress kept in the loop?\n\nTo some degree. As part of Brennan\u2019s confirmation process, Senate Intelligence Committee members were granted access to Justice Department memos justifying the use of drones, and a similar white paper was shared last year. The Committee and its House counterpart are also allowed to review individual strikes, including the intelligence behind them and video obtained during their commission. But they have not tried to limit the program in any way. \u201dI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever seen anything that we thought was inappropriate,\u201d one Congressional aide told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHow about the courts?\n\nNope. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has proposed establishing a specialized court to approve drone strikes based on FISA courts that approve surveillance of suspected foreign intelligence in the U.S., but that is, for now, just an idea. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Obama, has called for an oversight board placed within the executive branch.\n\nIs this legal?\n\nThe Justice Department certainly thinks so, though the reasons why are classified, and lawsuits to expose them have proven unsuccessful. The clearest window we\u2019ve gotten into their reasoning as relates to the killing of U.S. citizenscomes from a white paper leaked to NBC News last month. It derives the authority for the strikes from the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed in the wake of 9/11, which grants the government broad powers against al-Qaeda. What\u2019s more, the white paper argues that drone strikes somehow don\u2019t run afoul of Executive Order 12333, the ban on assassinations as a tool of policy that has existed since the Ford administration, as they are used for \u201cself-defense.\u201d See also Brennan\u2019s speech here defending the program more broadly.\n\nAdministration critics aren\u2019t impressed, with the ACLU\u2019s Jameel Jaffeer noting the white paper, \u201cargues that the government has the right to carry out the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen.\u201d\n\nDoes it violate international law?\n\nThe Justice Department memo cites the UN Charter, which allows states to make war in the interest of self-defense, an interest also invoked by Brennan. Critics, like UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns, say that this defense is a stretch, and the killings plainly run afoul of the laws of war and international human rights treaties.\n\nAre other countries using drones this way?\n\nOnly the United States and the United Kingdom (which assists in the Pakistan drone effort) currently use drones in combat, but many other countries have acquired drone technology, including China, Russia, India, Iran and Israel. The U.K. uses Reapers and Predators while most other countries use the Israeli Aerospace Industries Heron or similar Israeli models. Drones saw combat use in Israel during the Gaza war of late 2008. Even Hezbollah has acquired reconnaissance drones. All told, the GAO estimates that 76 countries, at least, have drone technology.\n\nWhat do our allies think about it?\n\nEuropean allies other than Britain generally refrain from using drones to attack al-Qaeda, but frequently share intelligence that assists the drone program in selecting targets.\n\nWhat about the countries where we send drones? What do they think?\n\nThey\u2019re very mad. The Pakistani government has condemned the drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty, though there\u2019s evidence they\u2019re tacitly allowing the strikes to happen. The Yemeni government quietly agreed to the strikes, though murmurs of opposition have emerged of late. Citizens in both countries deplore the campaigns.\n\nIs it actually weakening al-Qaeda?\n\nNew America estimates that 1,967 \u2013 3,236 militants were killed in Pakistan and Yemen, meaning the overwhelming majority of casualties were intended targets. That said, the share of deaths who were \u201chigh-profile targets\u201d was 11 percent under Obama and 33 percent under Bush according to New America. And there are deeper doubts as to whether the strategy is recruiting more militants than it kills, by turning local populations against the United States. The attempted Times Square bomber, for instance, cited drones as a motivating force.\n\nIt could also be a bad idea even if it is weakening al-Qaeda. Many have noted that the money spent on anti-terrorism efforts might save more lives if devoted to tackling more mundane threats, like auto accidents.\n\nThanks to Zack Beauchamp for research help throughout.", "comment_3": "#News: Everything you need to know about the #drone debate, in one FAQ - Washington Post (blog) http://t.co/QdRNqGJ1pP #WillFollowBack", "split": "train"}

He also directs the center\u2019s Washington, D.C., office.\n\nIf Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama\u2019s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.\n\nBut one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)\n\nRetirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it\u2019s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.\n\nOver the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.\n\nThe importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party\u2019s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.\n\nIn 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party\u2019s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.\n\nRepublicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics\u2019 Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.\n\nBut in all likelihood, the foundation for this year\u2019s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That\u2019s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.\n\nAn election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the purposes of this \u201cwhat if\u201d exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:\n\nWest Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito\u2019s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito\u2019s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle \u2013 she\u2019s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn\u2019t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive \u2013 but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we\u2019d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.\n\nMontana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh\u2019s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.", "comment_3": "@senatemajldr Hey Mitch, you have to worry about republicans voting NO. don\u2019t blame it on democrats.

WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, we're here in Ohio. Senator Obama is here. This is the debate. You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me.\n\nAnd therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.\n\nYou know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.\n\nAnd Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.\n\nMatt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from.\n\nSo I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside.\n\nI do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.\n\nI have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out.\n\nAccording to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.\n\nThe reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate. That is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.\n\nAnd the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.\n\nNow, Senator Clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate. She hasn't indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable. And so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.\n\nBut I think it's very important to understand the context of this, and that is that Senator Clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.\n\nAnd, you know, we haven't whined about it because I understand that's the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that Senator Clinton has taken throughout this campaign I think is simply not accurate.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator Clinton, on this subject --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: But I have to -- I have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly we've had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our campaign. But this is an issue that goes to the heart of whether or not this country will finally do what is right, and that is to provide quality affordable health care to every single person.\n\nSenator Obama has a mandate in his plan. It's a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children. That's about 150 million people who would be required to do that. The difference between Senator Obama and myself is that I know, from the work I've done on health care for many years, that if everyone's not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do what's called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.\n\nWe will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.\n\nAnd most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the University of Pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care. That's a core Democratic Party value. It's something that ever since Harry Truman we have stood for.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd what I find regrettable is that in Senator Obama's mailing that he has sent out across Ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the Republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts who've evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it. It is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.\n\nSEN. OBAMA (?): (Inaudible.)\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So I think it's imperative that we stand as Democrats for universal health care. I've staked out a claim for that. Senator Edwards did. Others have. But Senator Obama has not.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, look, I believe in universal health care, as does Senator Clinton. And this is -- this is, I think, the point of the debate, is that Senator Clinton repeatedly claims that I don't stand for universal health care. And, you know, for Senator Clinton to say that, I think, is simply not accurate.\n\nEvery expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it. President Clinton's own secretary of Labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across Ohio, all across Texas, Rhode Island, Vermont, all across America, will be able to obtain it. And we do more to reduce costs than any other plan that's been out there.\n\nNow, I have no objection to Senator Clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as we've heard tonight, we still don't know how Senator Clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we don't know the level of subsidies that she's going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still can't afford it, even with the subsidies.\n\nAnd they are then worse off. They then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: That is a genuine difference between myself and Senator Clinton.\n\nAnd the last point I would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate. The insurance companies don't mind making sure that everybody has to purchase their product. That's not something they're objecting to. The question is, are we going to make sure that it is affordable for everybody? And that's my goal when I'm president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, as you two --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Brian -- Brian, wait a minute. I've got -- this is too important.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama has a mandate. He would enforce the mandate by requiring parents to buy insurance for their children.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: This is true.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is the case.\n\nIf you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable. So there's no difference here.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, there is a difference.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: It's just that I know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children. So you can insure the children, and then you've got the bread-winner who can't afford health insurance or doesn't have it for him or herself.\n\nAnd in fact, it would be as though Franklin Roosevelt said let's make Social Security voluntary -- that's -- you know, that's -- let's let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if President Johnson said let's make Medicare voluntary.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, let me --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: What we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up. It's like when you get a 401(k), it's your employer. The employer automatically enrolls you. You would be enrolled.\n\nAnd under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan. A comparison of the plans like the ones we're proposing found that actually I would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than Senator Obama's plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but I would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income. So it will be affordable.\n\nNow, if you want to say that we shouldn't try to get everyone into health insurance, that's a big difference, because I believe if we don't have universal health care, we will never provide prevention.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have the most aggressive measures to reduce costs and improve quality. And time and time again, people who have compared our two approaches have concluded that.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Brian, I'm sorry.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So let's -- let's have a debate about the facts.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm going to get filibuttered -- I'm getting filibustered a little bit here.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: The last answer on this topic.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I mean, it is just not accurate to say that Senator Clinton does more to control costs than mine. That is not the case. There are many experts who have concluded that she does not.\n\nI do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price. On the -- on the point of many adults, we don't want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized. And that is what Senator Clinton's plan does.\n\nNow, I am -- I am happy to have a discussion with Senator Clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care. What I do not accept -- and which is what Senator Clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say there's no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.\n\nBut it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care. That is an area where I believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it. In fact, Medicare Part B is not mandated, it is voluntary. And yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, Hillary, and the reason they choose to purchase it is because it's a good deal. And if people in Cleveland or anywhere in Ohio end up seeing a plan that is affordable for them, I promise you they are snatching it up because they are desperate to get health care. And that's what I intend to provide as president of the United States.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, I'm going to change the subject.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: About 20 percent of -- about 20 percent of the people who are uninsured have the means to buy insurance. They're often young people --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- who think they're immortal --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Which is why I cover them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- except when the illness or the accident strikes. And what Senator Obama has said, that then, once you get to the hospital, you'll be forced to buy insurance, I don't think that's a good idea. We ought to plan for it --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and we ought to make sure we cover everyone.\n\nThat is the only way to get to universal health care coverage.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is what I've worked for for 15 years --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and I believe that we can achieve it. But if we don't even have a plan to get there, and we start out by leaving people, you'll never ever control costs, improve quality, and cover everyone.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect to the young people, my plan specifically says that up until the age of 25 you will be able to be covered under your parents' insurance plan, so that cohort that\n\nSenator Clinton is talking about will, in fact, have coverage.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, a 16-minute discussion on health care is certainly a start. (Laughter.) I'd like to change up --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, there's hardly anything be more important? I think it would be good to talk about health care and how we're we going get to universal health care.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I -- well, here's another important topic, and that's NAFTA, especially where we're sitting here tonight. And this is a tough one depending on who you ask. The Houston Chronicle has called it a big win for Texas, but Ohio Democratic Senator Brown, your colleague in the Senate, has called it a job-killing trade agreement. Senator Clinton, you've campaigned in south Texas. You've campaigned here in Ohio. Who's right?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, can I just point out that in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time. And I don't mind. I -- you know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious, and if anybody saw \"Saturday Night Live,\" you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow. (Laughter, boos.) I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues. But I'm happy to answer it.\n\nYou know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. I said that it worked in some parts of our country, and I've seen the results in Texas. I was in Laredo in the last couple of days. It's the largest inland port in America now. So clearly, some parts of our country have been benefited.\n\nBut what I have seen, where I represent up-state New York, I've seen the factories closed and moved. I've talked to so many people whose children have left because they don't have a good shot. I've had to negotiate to try to keep factories open, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, because the companies got tax benefits to actually move to another country.\n\nSo what I have said is that we need to have a plan to fix NAFTA. I would immediately have a trade timeout, and I would take that time to try to fix NAFTA by making it clear that we'll have core labor and environmental standards in the agreement.\n\nWe will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\n\nAnd if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear.\n\nBased on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: \"If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months.\n\nThe president can say to Canada and Mexico, we are out. This has not been a good agreement.\" Will U.S. president say we are out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, so obviously, you'd have to say to Canada and Mexico that that's exactly what we're going to do. But you know, in fairness --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Just because -- maybe Clinton --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, I am serious.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: You will get out. You will notify Mexico and Canada, NAFTA is gone in six months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I will say we will opt out of NAFTA unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America.\n\nBut let's be fair here, Tim. There are lots of parts of New York that have benefitted, just like there are lots of parts of Texas that have benefitted. The problem is in places like upstate New York, places like Youngstown, Toledo, and others throughout Ohio that have not benefitted. And if you look at what I have been saying, it has been consistent.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama told the farmers of Illinois a couple of years ago that he wanted more trade agreements. I -- right now --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: We're going to get -- we're going to get to Senator Obama, but I want to stay on your terms --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but that -- but that is important --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: -- because this was something that you wrote about as a real success for your husband. You said it was good on balance for New York and America in 2004, and now you're in Ohio and your words are much different, Senator. The record is very clear.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I -- I -- you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so.\n\nBut you know, Tim, when you look at what the Cleveland Plain Dealer said when they examined the kind of criticism that Senator Obama was making of me -- it's not me saying it -- they said it was erroneous. And it was erroneous because it didn't look at the entire picture, both at what I've said and what I've done.\n\nBut let's talk about what we're going to do. It is not enough just to criticize NAFTA, which I have, and for some years now. I have put forward a very specific plan about what I would do, and it does include telling Canada and Mexico that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labor and environmental standards -- not side agreements, but core agreements; that we will enhance the enforcement mechanism; and that we will have a very clear view of how we're going to review NAFTA going forward to make sure it works, and we're going to take out the ability of foreign companies to sue us because of what we do to protect our workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI would also say that you can go back and look at from the very beginning -- I think David Gergen was on TV today remembering that I was very skeptical about it.\n\nIt has worked in some parts of America. It has not worked in Ohio. It has not worked in upstate New York. And since I've been in the Senate -- neither of us voted on this. That wasn't something either of us got to cast an independent vote on. Since I have been in the Senate, I have worked to try to ameliorate the impact of these trade agreements.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But let me button this up. Absent the change that you're suggesting, you are willing to opt out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that NAFTA had been helpful. The Associated Press today ran a story about NAFTA, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue. Simple question: Will you, as president, say to Canada and Mexico, \"This has not worked for us; we are out\"?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that Senator Clinton talked about. And I think actually Senator Clinton's answer on this one is right. I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced. And that is not what has been happening so far.\n\nThat is something that I have been consistent about. I have to say, Tim, with respect to my position on this, when I ran for the United States Senate, the Chicago Tribune, which was adamantly pro-NAFTA, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to NAFTA.\n\nAnd that conversation that I had with the Farm Bureau, I was not ambivalent at all. What I said was that NAFTA and other trade deals can be beneficial to the United States because I believe every U.S. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody. And we can't shy away from globalization. We can't draw a moat around us. But what I did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is we've been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and what's good for multinationals, and we haven't been looking at what's good for communities here in Ohio, in my home state of Illinois, and across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd as president, what I want to be is an advocate on behalf of workers. Look, you know, when I go to these plants, I meet people who are proud of their jobs. They are proud of the products that they've created. They have built brands and profits for their companies. And when they see jobs shipped overseas and suddenly they are left not just without a job, but without health care, without a pension, and are having to look for seven-buck-an-hour jobs at the local fast-food joint, that is devastating on them, but it's also devastating on the community. That's not the way that we're going to prosper as we move forward.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator, two journalists here in Ohio wrote a piece called \"Business as Usual,\" which is very well known, suggesting it wasn't trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the Ph.D.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state.\n\nThe fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever. Ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to Canada and Mexico. Are you sure this has not been better for Ohio than you're suggesting?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm positive it hasn't been better for Ohio. But you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/can't ?) be the only part of our economic agenda. But we've seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers.\n\nWhat do we have to do? We're going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that we're competitive. And I've got a plan to do that. We're going to have to invest in science and technology. We've got to vastly improve our education system. We have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in Ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient.\n\nWe can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade. So there are all sorts of things that we're going to have to do to make the United States economy much more competitive, and those are plans that I have put forward in this campaign and I expect to pursue as president of the United States of America.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, on the issue of jobs, I watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in Wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable. And I've had a chance to read it very carefully. It does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years.\n\nAnd I was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in Buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down Route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate New York. There's been a net loss of 30,000 jobs. And when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told The Buffalo News, \"I might have been a little exuberant.\" Tonight will you say that the pledge of 5 million jobs might be a little exuberant?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, Tim, because what happened in 2000 is that I thought Al Gore was going to be president. And when I made the pledge I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity.\n\nAnd as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term I have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal. And the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- I mean, this is not a big leap. Twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the Clinton administration under my husband. We can create at least 5 million new jobs.\n\nI'm not just talking about it. I helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs. I want to see people throughout Ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and I know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the Democrats wanted, as I originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.\n\nYou know, take a country like Germany. They made a big bet on solar power. They have a smaller economy and population than ours.\n\nThey've created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that have to be done in Youngstown, in Dayton, in Cincinnati. These are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through. So I do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Brian?\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, yesterday Senator Clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and I'm going to read you a quote from it. Quote, \"We've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We cannot let that happen again. America has already taken that chance one time too many.\" Some of the comments in the speech were more pointed. The senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of George W. Bush at the same period. Provided you could be going into a general election against a Republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Senator Clinton I think equates experience with longevity in Washington. I don't think the American people do and I don't think that if you look at the judgments that we've made over the last several years that that's the accurate measure. On the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into Iraq -- I was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-American sentiment -- that it would distract us from Afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and I do not believe it has made us more safe.\n\nAl Qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both Senator Clinton and I are talking about. So on Pakistan, during the summer I suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards Musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd many people said at the time well, you can't target those terrorists because Musharraf is our ally and we don't want to offend him. In fact, what we had was neither stability in Pakistan nor democracy in Pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in Pakistan we would be much further along now than we are. So on the critical issues that actually matter I believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that I think has been superior to Senator Clinton's as well as Senator McCain's.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, Senator Clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not Senator Obama was qualified to be commander in chief. Is your contention in this latest speech that America would somehow be taking a chance on Senator Obama as commander in chief?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to Beijing and standing up for women's rights as human rights and so much else. And every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, Senator Obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. He's to be commended for having given the speech. Many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didn't have responsibility, he didn't have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war. And when he came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same. We have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently. So the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasn't just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference? Where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?\n\nAnd on a number of other issues, I just believe that, you know, as Senator Obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take. I have long advocated a much tougher approach to Musharraf and to Pakistan, and have pushed the White House to do that.\n\nAnd I disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.\n\nSo I think you've got to look at, you know, what I have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee for now five years. And I think that, you know, standing on that stage with Senator McCain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, I will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really America must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Let me just follow up. My objections to the war in Iraq were simply -- not simply a speech. I was in the midst of a U.S. Senate campaign. It was a high-stakes campaign. I was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and I was very specific as to why.\n\nAnd so when I bring this up, it is not simply to say \"I told you so,\" but it is to give you an insight in terms of how I would make decisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder. It was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then we've voted the same way. Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out. The question is, who's making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch? And the fact is that Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to George Bush on day one on this critical issue. So the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we can't afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the United States of America.\n\nWith respect to Pakistan, I never said I would bomb Pakistan. What I said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin Laden or other key al Qaeda officials, and we -- and Pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should. And just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al Qaeda official.\n\nThat is the position that we should have taken in the first place. And President Musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we don't know how the new legislature in Pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.\n\nAnd so my claim is not simply based on a speech. It is based on the judgments that I've displayed during the course of my service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while I've been in the United States Senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, I think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against Bush and Cheney. And that is how we're going to be able to debate John McCain. Having a debate with John McCain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, I think, does not put you in a strong position.\n\nTim Russert.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I guess that --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about Iraq, because this is important, I think, to Democratic voters particularly. You both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. You both have said you'd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al Qaeda, to neutralize Iran. If the Iraqi government said, President Clinton or President Obama, you're pulling out your troops this quickly?\n\nYou're going to be gone in a year, but you're going to leave a residual force behind? No. Get out. Get out now. If you don't want to stay and protect us, we're a sovereign nation. Go home now.\" Will you leave?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, if the Iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there. This is a sovereign government, as George Bush continually reminds us.\n\nNow, I think that we can be in a partnership with Iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of Iraqis and to meet our national security interests.\n\nBut in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why I have said that as soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed. We will provide them continued support. But it is important for us not to be held hostage by the Iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, that's distracting us from Afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in America that will make us more competitive and more safe.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, if the Iraqis said I'm sorry, we're not happy with this arrangement; if you're not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. And I believe that there is no military solution that the Americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the Iraqi government. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me ask -- let me ask you this, Senator. I want to ask you --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: And they need to take responsibility for themselves. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask both of you this question, then. If we -- if this scenario plays out and the Americans get out in total and al Qaeda resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals. And I believe that what's --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But this is reality.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No -- well, it isn't reality. You're -- you're -- you're making lots of different hypothetical assessments.\n\nI believe that it is in America's interests and in the interests of the Iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal. I've been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and I've been pushing them to actually do it. I've also said that I would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that I asked begun to be put together as soon as I became president.\n\nAnd I think we can take out one to two brigades a month. I've also been a leader in trying to prevent President Bush from getting us committed to staying in Iraq regardless for as long as Senator McCain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.\n\nSo, when you talk about what we need to do in Iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of America. And I believe this is in the best interest.\n\nBut I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.\n\nYou have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, I want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee. But also, do you reserve a right as American president to go back into Iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI have been very clear in talking to the American people about what I would do with respect to Afghanistan.\n\nI think we have to have more troops there to bolster the NATO effort. I think we have to show that we are not maintaining permanent bases in Iraq because Secretary Gates, our current Defense secretary, indicated that we are getting resistance from our allies to put more troops into Afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in Iraq and I think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in Afghanistan in part because of what's happened in Iraq.\n\nNow, I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests. And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad. So that is true, I think, not just in Iraq, but that's true in other places. That's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan.\n\nI think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on Americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator, I need to reserve --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but I have -- I just have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Senator, I've got to --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Now wait a minute, I have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I've got to get us to a break because television doesn't stop.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- Iraq.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Can you hold that thought until we come back from a break? We have limited commercial interruptions tonight, and we have to get to one of them now. Despite the snowstorm swirling outside here in Cleveland, we're having a warm night in the arena. We'll return to it right after this. (Laughter, applause.)\n\n(Announcements.)\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back, and because our first segment went long and we are in a large arena -- (cheers, applause) --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mike) -- for Hillary!\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: -- we are just now welcoming back both of our candidates to the stage and asking our cooperation of the audience.\n\nWe're back live tonight in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSenator Obama, we started tonight talking about what could be construed as a little hyperbole. Happens from time to time on the campaign trail. You have recently been called out on some yourself. I urge you to look at your monitor and we'll take a look.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (From videotape.) Now I could stand up here and say: Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open -- (laughter) -- the light will come down -- (laughter) -- celestial choirs will be singing -- (laughter) -- and everyone will know we should do the right thing, and the world will be perfect!\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Sounds good! (Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Of all the charges -- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (Chuckles.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: That was Senator Clinton. But since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: How did you take those remarks when you heard them?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I thought Senator Clinton showed some good humor there. I would give her points for delivery.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Look, I understand the broader point that Senator Clinton's been trying to make over the last several weeks. You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service, that's how I brought Democrats and Republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, that's how I helped to reform a welfare system that wasn't working in Illinois, that's how I've provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so I'm very proud of that track record.\n\nAnd if Senator Clinton thinks that it's all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at Walter Reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before I got to the Senate. And I changed that law. Or talk to those folks who I think have recognized that special interests are dominating Washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in Ohio.\n\nAnd so when I pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists can't get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of Congress and they have to disclose who they're getting money from and who they're bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.\n\nJust one point I'll make, I was in Cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one. And these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they don't have health care. One of them doesn't have a job. One of them is looking after an aging parent. Two of them were looking after disabled children. One of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job. And you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them. That is not who George Bush or Dick Cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.\n\nAnd so I am not interested in talk. I am not interested in speeches. I would not be running if I wasn't absolutely convinced that I can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the American dream.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, let me ask you, Senator Clinton: What did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I was having a little fun. You know, it's hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.\n\nBut the larger point is that I know trying to get health insurance for every American that's affordable will not be easy. It's not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody it's the right thing to do. You know, 15 years ago I tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and I know it takes a fighter. It takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.\n\nYou know, I have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies. These have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the White House did, but because members of Congress went along. And I want to get that money back and invest it in the American middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout Ohio, because what I hear as I go from Toledo to Parma to Cleveland to, you know, Dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but they're not getting ahead. They feel like they're invisible to their government. So when it came time to vote on Dick Cheney's energy bill, I voted no, and Senator Obama voted yes. When it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which I think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- I voted yes and Senator Obama voted no.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator -- Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight. And I believe that I am a fighter, and I will fight for the people of Ohio and the people of America.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: What I was attempting to do here is to show something Senator Obama said about you, and I'm told it's ready.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let's try it.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's try it. Hang on. Watch your monitor.\n\nLet's try it. We're going to come back to you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: But I'm going to have an opportunity to respond to this.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (From videotape.) -- herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of. And so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isn't politically convenient, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Now, Senator Obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but I've been wanting to ask you about this assertion that Senator Clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that when Senator Clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, \"Here's what I did.\"\n\n\"Here's what we did.\" \"Here's what we accomplished\" -- which is fine.\n\nAnd I have not -- I have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and I don't begrudge her claiming that as experience. What I've said, and what I would continue to maintain, is you can't take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like NAFTA, you say, well, I -- behind the scenes, I was disagreeing. That doesn't work. So you have to, I think, take both responsibility as well as credit.\n\nNow there are several points that I think Senator Clinton made that I -- we need to discuss here. First of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards. Keep in mind, I objected to the entire bill -- a bill that Senator Clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for. And in one of the debates with you guys said, well, I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass -- which, as a general rule, doesn't work. If you don't want it to pass, you vote against it. (Laughter.)\n\nYou know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care. And look -- I do not in any way doubt that Senator Clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all Americans.\n\nWhat I have said is that the way she approached it back in '93, I think, was wrong in part because she had the view that what's required is simply to fight. And Senator Clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party. And as a consequence, there were a number of people, like Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Bill Bradley and Pat Moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations. And we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.\n\nI am absolutely clear that hope is not enough. And it is not going to be easy to pass health care. If it was, it would have already gotten done. It's not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country. ExxonMobil made $11 billion last quarter. They are not going to give up those profits easily.\n\nBut what I also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, we're going to have to mobilize and inspire the American people so that they're paying attention to what their government is doing. And that's what I've been doing in this campaign, and that's what I will do as president.\n\nAnd there's nothing romantic or silly about that. If the American people are activated, that's how change is going to happen.\n\nThe second thing we've going to have to do is we're actually going to have to go after the special interests.\n\nSenator Clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you can't just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away. That is absolutely true, but it doesn't help if you're taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests. They are less likely to go away.\n\nSo it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence Congress. And yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the American people to get involved and pay attention.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word. Nothing more important. Last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out. You checked \"Yes\" on a questionnaire. And now Senator McCain has said, calling your bluff, let's do it. You seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.\n\nWhy won't you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Tim, I am not yet the nominee. Now, what I've said is, is that when I am the nominee, if I am the nominee -- because we've still got a bunch of contests left and Senator Clinton's a pretty tough opponent. If I am the nominee, then I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because Tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.\n\nSenator McCain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people aren't exactly clear whether all the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.\n\nNow what I want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign. I said very early on I would not take PAC money. I would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists. That -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because I had confidence that the American people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.\n\nWe have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50. We average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the American people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody who's interested in good government and politics supports.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So you may opt out of public financing. You may break your word.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: What I -- what I have said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility. You have loaned your campaign $5 million. You and your husband file a joint return. You refuse to release that joint return, even though former President Clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.\n\nYour chief supporter here in Ohio, Governor Strickland, made releasing his opponent's tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, \"Accountability, transparency.\" If he's not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding? We should question what's going on.\n\nWhy won't you release your tax return, so the voters of Ohio, Texas, Vermont, Rhode Island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, the American people who support me are bankrolling my campaign. That's -- that's obvious. You can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that I've gotten. And ever since I lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously. I'm thrilled at so many people getting involved. And we're raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the Internet. And if anybody's out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to HillaryClinton.com, because that's who's funding my campaign.\n\nAnd I will release my tax returns. I have consistently said that. And I will --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Why not now?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, Tim, because I have been as open as I can be.\n\nYou have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and I have very extensive filings with the Senate where --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So, before next Tuesday's primary?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I can't get it together by then, but I will certainly work to get it together. I'm a little busy right now; I hardly have time to sleep. But I will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: One other issue. You talked about releasing documents. On January 30th, the National Archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady. It's now in the custody of former President Clinton. Will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. I've urged that the process be as quick as possible. It's a cumbersome process, set up by law. It doesn't just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position. And I have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can. Now, also, President Bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and I would urge the Bush White House to move as quickly as possible.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But you've had it for more than a month. Will you get to him -- will you get it to the White House immediately?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: As soon as we can, Tim. I've urged that, and I hope it will happen.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.\n\nOn Sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, Chicago Tribune: \"Louis Farrakhan Backs Obama for President at Nation of Islam Convention in Chicago.\" Do you accept the support of Louis Farrakhan?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can't censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we're not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Do you reject his support?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Tim, you know, I can't say to somebody that he can't say that he thinks I'm a good guy. (Laughter.) You know, I -- you know, I -- I have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and I think that indicates to the American people what my stance is on those comments.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: The problem some voters may have is, as you know, Reverend Farrakhan called Judaism \"gutter religion.\"\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I think -- I am very familiar with his record, as are the American people. That's why I have consistently denounced it.\n\nThis is not something new. This is something that -- I live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I've been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.\n\nRUSSERT: The title of one of your books, \"Audacity of Hope,\" you acknowledge you got from a sermon from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the head of the Trinity United Church. He said that Louis Farrakhan \"epitomizes greatness.\"\n\nHe said that he went to Libya in 1984 with Louis Farrakhan to visit with Moammar Gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, \"your Jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in Hell.\"\n\nRUSSERT: What do you do to assure Jewish-Americans that, whether it's Farrakhan's support or the activities of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding Israel and not in any way suggesting that Farrakhan epitomizes greatness?\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have some of the strongest support from the Jewish community in my hometown of Chicago and in this presidential campaign. And the reason is because I have been a stalwart friend of Israel's. I think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and I think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the United States is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the Jewish community.\n\nAnd the reason that I have such strong support is because they know that not only would I not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what I want to do is rebuild what I consider to be a historic relationship between the African-American community and the Jewish community.\n\nYou know, I would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of Jewish Americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the South. And that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.\n\nBut, you know, the reason that I have such strong support in the Jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my U.S. Senate campaign and it's true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that I consistently have not only befriended the Jewish community, not only have I been strong on Israel, but, more importantly, I've been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.\n\nWhen I was -- just last point I would make -- when I was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in conjunction with Martin Luther King's birthday in front of a large African-American audience, I specifically spoke out against anti- Semitism within the African-American community. And that's what gives people confidence that I will continue to do that when I'm president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator...\n\nCLINTON: I just want to add something here, because I faced a similar situation when I ran for the Senate in 2000 in New York. And in New York, there are more than the two parties, Democratic and Republican. And one of the parties at that time, the Independence Party, was under the control of people who were anti-Semitic, anti- Israel. And I made it very clear that I did not want their support. I rejected it. I said that it would not be anything I would be comfortable with. And it looked as though I might pay a price for that. But I would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either Israel or Jewish people in our country.\n\nAnd, you know, I was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of New York supported me and I won. But at the time, I thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.\n\nRUSSERT: Are you suggesting Senator Obama is not standing on principle?\n\nCLINTON: No. I'm just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it. And there's a difference between denouncing and rejecting. And I think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- I have no doubt that everything that Barack just said is absolutely sincere. But I just think, we've got to be even stronger. We cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have to say I don't see a difference between denouncing and rejecting. There's no formal offer of help from Minister Farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it. But if the word \"reject\" Senator Clinton feels is stronger than the word \"denounce,\" then I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce.\n\nCLINTON: Good. Good. Excellent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWILLIAMS: Rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.\n\nWe're going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks. We'll be back live from Cleveland right after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWILLIAMS: We are back from Cleveland State University. We continue with our debate.\n\nThe question beginning this segment is for you, Senator Obama.\n\nThe National Journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of Ted Kennedy.\n\nIn a general election, going up against a Republican Party, looking for converts, Republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than Ted Kennedy?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, let's take a look at what the National Journal rated us on.\n\nIt turned out that Senator Clinton and I had differences on two votes. The first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldn't go back, and I thought it was bad policy.\n\nThe second -- and this, I think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- I supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the Senate, because I thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the Senate, that they weren't being investigated by the Senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.\n\nThis is something that I've tried to push as part of my ethics package.\n\nOBAMA: It was rejected. And according to the National Journal, that position is a liberal position.\n\nNow, I don't think that's a liberal position. I think there are a lot of Republicans and a lot of Independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated. So the categories don't make sense.\n\nAnd part of the reason I think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that Senator Obama's campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more Independent votes than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, and Republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head? It's because people don't want to go back to those old categories of what's liberal and what's conservative.\n\nThey want to see who is making sense, who's fighting for them, who's going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense? That's what I've been doing, and that's why, you know, the proof is in the pudding. We've been attracting more Independent and Republican support than anybody else, and that's why every poll shows that right now I beat John McCain in a match-up in the general election.\n\nWILLIAMS: Let's go from domestic to foreign affairs and Tim Russert.\n\nRUSSERT: Before the primary on Tuesday, on Sunday, March 2, there's an election in Russia for the successor to President Putin. What can you tell me about the man who's going to be Mr. Putin's successor?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I can tell you that he's a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by Putin, who Putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know. You know, there's a lot of information still to be acquired. That the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against Putin's hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising Putin. So this is a clever but transparent way for Putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how we're going to deal with Russia going forward.\n\nI have been very critical of the Bush administration for what I believe to have been an incoherent policy toward Russia. And with the reassertion of Russia's role in Europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting Iran's nuclear ambitions, for example, it's imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward Russia. But I have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by Putin.\n\nRUSSERT: Who will it be? Do you know his name?\n\nCLINTON: Medvedev -- whatever.\n\nRUSSERT: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yes.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, do you know anything about him?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think Senator Clinton speaks accurately about him. He is somebody who was hand-picked by Putin. Putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in Russia in terms of running the government. And, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of President Bush's administration when he said -- you know, he met with Putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.\n\nHe then proceeded to neglect our relationship with Russia at a time when Putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his European neighbors, as well as satellites of the former Soviet Union. And so we did not send a signal to Mr. Putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us. That is something that we have to change.\n\nRUSSERT: He's 42 years old, he's a former law professor. He is Mr. Putin's campaign manager. He is going to be the new president of Russia. And if he says to the Russian troops, you know what, why don't you go help Serbia retake Kosovo, what does President Obama do?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that we work with the international community that has also recognized Kosovo, and state that that's unacceptable. But, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in NATO to deal with this issue.\n\nWe don't have to work in isolation. And this is an area where I think that the Clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.\n\nOBAMA: It has not been perfect, but it saved lives. And we created a situation in which not only Kosovo, but other parts of the former Yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader European community.\n\nBut, you know, be very clear: We have recognized the country of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has Great Britain and many other countries in the region. And I think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.\n\nRUSSERT: Before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service. Looking back through them, is there any words or vote that you'd like to take back?\n\nSenator Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, obviously, I've said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding Iraq was a sincere vote, I would not have voted that way again.\n\nI would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in Iraq. And I regret deeply that President Bush waged a preemptive war, which I warned against and said I disagreed with.\n\nBut I think that this election has to be about the future. It has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what we're going to inherit.\n\nYou know, we've just been talking about Russia. We could have gone around the world. We could have gone to Latin America and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy. We could have talked about Africa and the failure to end the genocide in Darfur.\n\nWe could have gone on to talk about the challenge that China faces and the Middle East, which is deteriorating under the pressures of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the interference that is putting Israel's security at stake.\n\nWe could have done an entire program, Tim, on what we will inherit from George Bush.\n\nAnd what I believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with Putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we don't have much time to try to make up for our losses.\n\nRUSSERT: But to be clear, you'd like to have your vote back?\n\nCLINTON: Absolutely. I've said that many times.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, any statements or vote you'd like to take back?\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, when I first arrived in the Senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding Terri Schiavo. And I remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed Congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.\n\nIt wasn't something I was comfortable with, but it was not something that I stood on the floor and stopped. And I think that was a mistake, and I think the American people understood that that was a mistake. And as a constitutional law professor, I knew better.\n\nAnd so that's an example I think of where inaction...\n\nRUSSERT: This is the young woman with the feeding tube...\n\nOBAMA: That's exactly right.\n\nRUSSERT: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.\n\nOBAMA: And I think that's an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.\n\nBut let me say this, since we're wrapping up this debate. We have gone through 20 debates now. And, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and we've got four coming up, and maybe more after that.\n\nBut the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is Senator Clinton has campaigned magnificently. She is an outstanding public servant. And I'm very proud to have been campaigning with her.\n\nAnd part of what I think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the American people.\n\nYou know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics. But when you spend as much time as Senator Clinton and I have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that people's expectations are so modest.\n\nYou know, they're not looking for government to solve all of their problems. They just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if they're about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the American dream.\n\nYou know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in Washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.\n\nAnd, you know, I have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the Democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government. That's why I think we're both running, and I'm very pleased that I've had this opportunity to run with Senator Clinton.\n\nRUSSERT: But the voters can only choose one, Brian.\n\nRUSSERT: And I think you have a question.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, we don't have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but I am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both. And I'll ask it of you fist, Senator Obama.\n\nWhat is the fundamental question you believe Senator Clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in Ohio and in Texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee? And then we will ask the same question of Senator Clinton.\n\nOBAMA: I have to say, Brian, I think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee. Now, I think I'd be better. Otherwise, I wouldn't be running. But there's no doubt that Senator Clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than John McCain, who I respect and I honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of George Bush over the last seven years.\n\nOn economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we can't afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we can't afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe. We can't afford it in terms of strategy.\n\nSo I don't think that Senator Clinton has to answer a question as to whether she's capable of being president or our standard bearer.\n\nI will say this, that the reason I think I'm better as the nominee is that I can bring this country together I think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region. And that is what's going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both Senator Clinton and I care so much about.\n\nAnd I also think I have a track record, starting from the days I moved to Chicago as a community organizer, when I was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a United States senator, I think I bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the American people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.\n\nThose are things -- those are qualities that I bring to this race, and I hope that the people of Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question Senator Obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Brian, there isn't any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the White House.\n\nAs I said last week, you know, it's been an honor to campaign. I still intend to do everything I can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.\n\nYou know, obviously I am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which I think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.\n\nSo I feel that either one of us will make history.\n\nThe question that I have been posing is, who can actually change the country? And I do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.\n\nYou know, when I wasn't successful about getting universal health care, I didn't give up. I just got to work and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. And, you know, today in Ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance. And yet this morning in Lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident. And she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, \"will you help us?\"\n\nThat's what my public life has been about. I want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have. And I will do whatever I can here in Ohio, in Texas, Rhode Island, in the states to come making that case. Because I think we do need a fighter back in the White House.\n\nYou know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president. It's time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can. And they deserve somebody who gets up in that White House and goes to bat for them.\n\nAnd that's what I will do.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.", "comment_3": "I can't wait for the next Democratic debate oh my god if she didn't release the transcript by then..

But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image \u2014 in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's \u2014 will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution \u2014 was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: \"If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a \"wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\"\n\nIn what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.\n\nRouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.\n\nLast but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.\n\nNetanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.\n\nThe irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.\n\nFor now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.", "comment_3": "Israel should welcome Rouhani's election victory via @AJAM  http://t.co/HrWRzwmCyU", "split": "train"}

H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.\n\n\n\nThe Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and \"fight to rein in the EPA.\" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.\n\n\n\nIn a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter \"Crying over spilt milk.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do spilt milk and oil have in common?\" he wrote. \"Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA\u2019s reasoning is that milk contains \u2018a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.\u2019 It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.\"\n\n\n\nWith visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.\n\n\n\nBeth Breeding, Griffith\u2019s press secretary, said her boss\u2019s information came from the EPA\u2019s website. So we went there.\n\n\n\nRight away, we found problems with Griffith\u2019s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a \"new ruling,\" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.\n\n\n\nThe EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of \u2018oil\u2019 from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.\"\n\n\n\nThe website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.\n\n\n\nSo what\u2019s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.\n\n\n\nThe simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here\u2019s what the regulation says:\n\n\n\n\"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws.\n\n\n\nTranslated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA\u2019s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell \"raw,\" or unpasteurized, milk, so the state\u2019s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards.\n\n\n\nRaw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.\n\n\n\nBaffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s review our findings.\n\n\n\nGriffith claimed a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.\n\n\n\nIn fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The \"new ruling\" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.\n\n\n\nSure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.\n\n\n\nGriffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False.", "comment_3": "PolitiFact Virginia | Morgan Griffith says EPA treats milk spills same way as oil spills http://t.co/qnRf8xiJ", "split": "train"}

You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.\n\nLet me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.\n\nSeven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.\n\nWe will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that's a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.\n\nIt is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.\n\nThe story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.\n\nMy own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.\n\nAs candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.\n\nNow there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.\n\nLobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.\n\nDivision and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.\n\nCronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.\n\nIt's a politics that uses 9/11 to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.\n\nEach candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.\n\nI am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.\n\nWe began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.\n\nAnd we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. We've reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. That's how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We don't need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. They're part of the problem. And when I'm President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.\n\nI know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the 20th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that's it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to \u201cbe patient,\u201d and to step aside for \u201csomeone with greater experience.\u201d But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, \u201cThe world is changing. The old ways will not do\u2026It is time for a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nIt is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just won't do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.\n\nIt is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.\n\nIn the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. I've been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, I'll make sure that CEOs can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. I'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And I'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $7 an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.\n\nWe're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. I'll give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $50,000 so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the woman I met who can't get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.\n\nShe can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they can't afford it. That's why my plan cuts costs by up to $2500 for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. That's the plan that I'll pass in my first term as President.\n\nIt is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it.\n\nWhen I'm President, we'll rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they're not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $4,000 tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.\n\nIt's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.\n\nWhen I'm President, we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I didn't do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I didn't get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. That's what I'll do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.\n\nAnd it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.\n\nI will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.\n\nWe need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that's exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you'll be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.\n\nI opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in 2002: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.\n\nI will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that's what I'll do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people \u201cin the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.\u201d\n\nIt's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, \u201cYou matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\u201d\n\nThis is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.\n\nWe've been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change isn't possible. That we're peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.\n\nAnd we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans won't cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor don't vote. The assumption that African-Americans can't support the white candidate; whites can't support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos can't come together.\n\nBut our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.\n\nWe followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.\n\nWe're the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.\n\nWe're the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.\n\nWe're the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.\n\nAnd we're the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.\n\nThat is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.\n\nThis is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time.", "comment_3": "What's the future of eCommerce?

{"comment_2": "Trump just signed an executive order called: \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States\" \n\n#Muslimban", "target": "real", "comment_1": "JUST IN: Pres. Trump signs new executive order for the \"protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into\u2026 https://t.co/tCshOF0Mis", "article": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\nSection 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nNumerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\n\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\nSec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).\n\n(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.\n\n(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.\n\n(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.\n\n(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant\u2019s likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant\u2019s ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n\n(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.\n\n(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\n(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest \u2014 including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship \u2014 and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.\n\n(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\n(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\n\nSec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.\n\nSec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\n\nSec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.\n\n(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\n\nSec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.\n\nSec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:\n\n(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;\n\n(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n\n(b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.\n\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nDONALD J.

EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for being here today. It\u2019s a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone.\n\nYou represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high you don\u2019t even get to use it.\n\nMany Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left. The insurance companies are fleeing. They\u2019re gone; so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now they\u2019ll be able to pick the plan they want, they\u2019ll be able to pick the doctor they want. They\u2019ll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You don\u2019t pick your doctor, you don\u2019t pick your plan -- you remember that one.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, we\u2019re going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And you\u2019ll see rates go down, down, down, and you\u2019ll see plans go up, up, up. You\u2019ll have a lot of choices.\n\nYou\u2019ll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today. They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting healthcare. More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and it\u2019s going to take a little while to get there. Once it does, it\u2019s going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didn\u2019t take a year or two years, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and that\u2019s the way it works. But we\u2019re willing to go through that process.\n\nWorking together, we\u2019ll get the job done. And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and we\u2019ll let the press stay for your stories if you like. But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden. I\u2019m watching the news -- looks so good. They\u2019re showing these reports about \"this one gets so much and this one gets so much.\"\n\nFirst of all, it covers very few people. And it\u2019s imploding. And \u201917 will be the worst year. And I said it once, I\u2019ll say it again -- because Obama is gone -- things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare. They\u2019re going to have tremendous increases.\n\nAnd the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position -- and I tell this to Tom Price all the time -- by repealing Obamacare -- because people aren\u2019t going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. They\u2019re not going to see the devastation in \u201917 and \u201918 and \u201919. It'll be gone by then, whether we do it or not. It\u2019ll be imploded off the map.\n\nSo the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great.\" It\u2019s a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didn\u2019t like him so much. That\u2019s the way life goes. That\u2019s human nature.\n\nThe fact is, Obamacare is a disaster. And I say this to the Republicans all the time: By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, \"Oh, it used to be so great.\" But it wasn\u2019t great. And I tell Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell everyone of them -- I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because it\u2019s going to blow itself off the map. But that\u2019s the wrong thing to do for the country, it\u2019s the wrong thing to do for our citizens.\n\nSo with that, I\u2019d like to introduce some of the folks and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare. And perhaps the press will even report it. (Laughter.)\n\nWould you like to start?\n\nMS. COUEY: Yeah, thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nMS. COUEY: Our rates are three times what they were before Obamacare started. We have one provider in our county. We have very little options for what we can and cannot do. We\u2019re a small-business owner; we\u2019re actually not a brick-and-mortar, we are cattle ranchers. We can\u2019t afford our equipment if we\u2019re paying these rates year after year after year.\n\nOur food source is in jeopardy because of this healthcare law. It\u2019s my basic --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I know. Sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s gone up three times, and then you have to pay -- if you don\u2019t want to use it, you have to pay. That\u2019s the all-time beauty. If you don\u2019t want to use it, you have to pay. And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right? Some people say, well, if I use it, I use it, I\u2019m paying too much. If I don\u2019t use it, I have to pay a penalty. And do you have to pay penalties? Do you ever do that, or you have to --\n\nMS. COUEY: We haven\u2019t as of yet, but we were uninsured in December. They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for healthcare expenses.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And it\u2019s gone up triple.\n\nMS. COUEY: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And before Obamacare, you actually had good healthcare.\n\nMS. COUEY: We did. We had a fantastic plan.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A lot of people -- nobody ever takes that into account. I\u2019m not saying the system before was good, because it wasn\u2019t, but millions of people had great healthcare that they loved.\n\nNow, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy. That, I can tell you.\n\nHow about you?\n\nPARTICIPANT: Well, we\u2019re kind of the same story as Carrie. In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids. For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just don\u2019t believe our neighbors should work harder so that we don\u2019t have to. So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance -- which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four -- then that was fine.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent. Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldn\u2019t carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce but I couldn\u2019t find a job that offered health insurance. So we entered under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, \"If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\"\n\nSo even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought we\u2019d still be okay with our doctors. We were on it for five months. Our pediatrician for our children wouldn\u2019t take it, my doctor wouldn\u2019t take it, so we paid them $8,000 in five months and were never able to use it.\n\nAnd I think what makes our family story unique is, we\u2019re by no means wealthy. In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together -- that was our gross income. And then in 2015, we made together -- since I had gone back to work -- $74,000. But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance -- and health costs --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So it\u2019s been a rough go.\n\nPARTICIPANT: It has, it\u2019s been hard.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How have you found Obamacare?\n\nPARTICIPANT: We\u2019ll be so happy to see it gone. I mean, it\u2019s almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think that\u2019s the story for a lot of people.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s put businesses in financial ruin.\n\nPARTICIPANT: That\u2019s right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s one of the biggest costs -- it has been disastrous for businesses.\n\nGo ahead, sir.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nMR. SEIFE: I think it\u2019s a great opportunity to talk to the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the healthcare law.\n\nI myself am from Miami. I haven\u2019t had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls and I\u2019m here. (Laughter.) So it just so happened I had -- every single year for the past couple of years I\u2019ve had a different insurance every single year. Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I -- my wife is an attorney, I\u2019m a computer programmer; I\u2019m a small business, my wife is a small business. And I just don\u2019t understand what happened. I have a daughter with a disability. We\u2019ve changed our plan every year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So your insurance was good before Obamacare.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. I never had --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Many people are like that. Many, many plans were great before Obamacare. They were so happy. And that doesn\u2019t justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and it\u2019s putting people out of business and it\u2019s putting them in the poorhouse.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nMR. SEIFE: It\u2019s just that we had to -- they cancelled our plans, and I couldn\u2019t understand why they cancelled our plans. So we had no other choice. I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan. I do not work for the government, I do not work for a large employer.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Very unfair.\n\nMR. SEIFE: We are ground zero. My case is ground zero for the healthcare law.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you represent a lot of people in the same situation.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Absolutely.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s very unfair.\n\nMR. SEIFE: Like my friend here, she\u2019s in the same situation. And I think it\u2019s very, very unfair. And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode, like you were saying. And my parents are from -- came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about. So I know what socialism is, and that\u2019s pretty much what -- this whole system was meant to have one single provider.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it turns out it's so expensive it\u2019s almost not socialism when you think about it. (Laughter.) You have to pay so much.\n\nWhat do you think? Go ahead.\n\nMS. SERTICH: I\u2019m from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real, it\u2019s not a myth. I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era. After losing it this year I decided to opt out. So right now I do not have traditional healthcare.\n\nAnd I went from a $365-a-month premium last year to a $809-premium this year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And a higher deductible.\n\nMS. SERTICH: The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays. So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didn\u2019t seem like a good use of my money. I thought I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have reached my deductible, and just decided to opt out. I went into a faith-based share program, and I\u2019m doing that.\n\nOne of the reasons I felt like I can do this -- totally taking a leap of faith -- is because I think -- I know you\u2019re going to get this taken care of. So I thought it\u2019s only going to be for a year. I will be on this program, I will opt out of traditional healthcare, or health insurance. And I think you\u2019re going to get it done.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?\n\nMS. SERTICH: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re paying the penalty?\n\nMS. SERTICH: Well, and my husband also owns his own business and can\u2019t afford to offer insurance to employees. And his employees who are also in the independent market, it\u2019s just getting too much. And I\u2019ve had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business. So I\u2019ve always been in that individual market, I\u2019ve always done what was right. I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for healthcare because I\u2019m a businessperson, I don\u2019t want any huge healthcare expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.\n\nSo I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, I\u2019ve got to get -- we\u2019ve got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance. So, I have.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard. At least 116 percent. Here\u2019s the bad news: It\u2019s going to go up more this year. Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare. That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the biggest problem I have, Tom. We\u2019re going to do them a big favor, but it\u2019s not the right way.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nMR. BROWN: Mr. President, thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Louis.\n\nMR. BROWN: My name is Louis Brown. I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. I'm an attorney by trade. In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress -- what became the Affordable Care Act -- I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time. I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and that\u2019s not something that I could go along with. So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. And we\u2019re focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in healthcare, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting non-discrimination against pro-life medical providers.\n\nEspecially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good school.\n\nMR. BROWN: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know from Saint John Paul II -- he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans -- the right to healthcare, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things -- are illusory if the right to life isn\u2019t defended with maximum determination.\n\nSeventeen million African Americans, it\u2019s shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. And I supported you in the presidential election, gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and I\u2019m really happy that you\u2019re here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer-funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American healthcare system, not the government. The government has its place, but the patient should be the center. So I\u2019m happy to support you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That\u2019s so nice. Thank you, I appreciate it. Great job.\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nDR. SETHI: Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me. My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, and across Tennessee I\u2019m a trauma surgeon. But what we do is --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll be in Tennessee on Wednesday.\n\nDR. MANNY: We look forward to hosting you, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll see you there.\n\nDR. MANNY: Yes, sir. We do these large community events in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients. So it\u2019s really a grassroots effort -- something that you understand better than anybody -- where people come out just to help people. Doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks. That\u2019s what we do.\n\nBut the one thing I\u2019ve been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really can\u2019t afford these rising premiums. So what they\u2019re doing is, effectively, they\u2019re paying the tax penalty because it\u2019s cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance. And so that\u2019s been a big problem that we\u2019re seeing across the state. So thank you so much for what you\u2019re doing to tackle this problem.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So you\u2019ve seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan we\u2019re going to get done.\n\nDR. MANNY: Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll get that out -- without penalties too, by the way. People don\u2019t mention all of the facts.\n\nYou know, the other thing about what we\u2019re talking about -- we really have a three-phase plan. They only want to talk about the first phase. The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles. But they don\u2019t want to talk about the bells and whistles. So they\u2019re really comparing things to something that won\u2019t be there for long.\n\nAnd the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress. I\u2019d love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it can\u2019t get done. So we\u2019re going to get something done that\u2019s going to be terrific.\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you, doctor, very much.\n\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\n\nMR. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. President. I\u2019d like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am in the farming industry.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good.\n\nMR. BROWN: And the effect that I\u2019ve had through Obamacare is my wife's and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own. And I\u2019ve seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me. And I have considered taking the option of the penalty because -- my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan -- just a catastrophic plan because I\u2019m a very healthy man -- if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wife\u2019s income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think -- the rate increase is just astronomical, and I\u2019m in the county that only has one option -- BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee --and I\u2019ve got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all. And I even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I don\u2019t need or don\u2019t want --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Will you be able to continue, in the years to come, if you have to keep going like this?\n\nMR. BROWN: They\u2019re dropping out every day -- the suppliers in other counties. There\u2019s 35 counties in Tennessee that has no options at all right now. I don\u2019t know what those folks do.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know what that means? That means somebody is going to make a lot of money. You know that. They\u2019re going to make a lot of money. (Laughter.) Somebody is going to -- well, a few. You\u2019re not going to make it. They\u2019re going to make it. There are people very happy about this situation.\n\nMR. BROWN: Thank you for the opportunity to be here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate. Thank you, Joel.\n\nDoctor?\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. Well, I\u2019m a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today. And I\u2019ll tell you, what I\u2019ve seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare. It was supposed to cover people who had -- like everyone has said here -- with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles. I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that they\u2019re responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high. And that\u2019s just the situation that cannot continue.\n\nMedicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesn\u2019t cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare. They\u2019re not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting. And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer -- I mean, my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient. It was very expensive outpatient care. Most physicians don\u2019t even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.\n\nAnd so the Medicaid expansion really hasn\u2019t covered them. The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because they\u2019re still paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles. And so it\u2019s really --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And do they even reach it with the high deductibles? They don\u2019t even reach it for the most part.\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: You know, oftentimes they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem, and they\u2019re in the hospital, and it\u2019s very expensive -- they don\u2019t even reach their deductible oftentimes. And so it\u2019s unfortunate. So I really appreciate it.\n\nI actually read the bill that\u2019s been produced that\u2019s coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it. I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had. So I really appreciate what you all are doing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate it, doctor. Thank you. Say hello to your wife.\n\nDR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Very nice. Thank you.\n\nGina.\n\nMS. SELL: Hi, Mr. President, I\u2019m Gina. I\u2019m from Wisconsin. I\u2019m a nurse, I\u2019m a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle-class families that were impacted by the ACA.\n\nBefore ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our senator just asking him, what do I do? Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy -- a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love? Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesn\u2019t even cover the medical --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So the healthcare is -- the Obamacare forced you to actually -- in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job.\n\nMS. SELL: Right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Even though you like your job.\n\nMS. SELL: Right. So I did end up getting a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at. But that came with a price because I was working three days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority. And after the ACA, I was forced -- because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and a deductible that didn\u2019t cover anything -- to find a job with benefits.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to use it.\n\nThe deductible was so high that essentially unless you had a really big problem, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to use it.\n\nMS. SELL: Correct, yes. And we're still in that boat. I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500. And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars. Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for three days straight because I had to work to afford our assurance, and I couldn\u2019t afford to bring her to the doctor. So it has been devastating for our family.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It's really not having insurance at all. A lot of Obamacare, you don\u2019t really have insurance because the deductibles are so high that you really don\u2019t have insurance, if you think about it.\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Good luck.\n\nMS. SELL: Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, sir.\n\nMR. KNOX: Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us. This is great. I have to start with something. As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, \"Dad, I'd like to have you give this to Mr. President for me.\" (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What do you have there? I wished I looked that good. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. KNOX: \"Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the USA. I think you are a great President and a great man. Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you.\" (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you. I wish I looked that good.\n\nMR. KNOX: So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them. I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, \"The most terrifying words in the English language are we're from the government and we're here to help.'\" (Laughter.) Kind of my feeling on healthcare.\n\nFrankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it. I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family healthcare for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do. I was one of the last holdouts. But, sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of healthcare. And that's sad. I tell my wife all the time -- you can have anything you want, we just can't everything we want. We have the best healthcare system in the world -- we do -- but it needs to be fixed -- whether it's small business owners, like myself -- I'm a manufacturer, I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing.\n\nWhat we'd like to see is not a government-operated market, but a free market. I sell (inaudible) equipment for a living. We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products. If we had a healthcare show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof. And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof. So we would like to see more of a free-market solution, going back to what made this country great -- entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare. And that's what we'd like to ask you for. And I'd like to say thank you very much.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: As you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be in a position like you are. So we're going to do that. Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen -- the competitive bidding -- every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help. And there are a lot of people like that.\n\nMR. KNOX: There's always been a safety net in the United States, and there should be. And, unfortunately, when I see 50,000 -- or 50 million Americans taking assistance in -- you know, they're market food stamps. That's like -- for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people who are Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth. So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, not free handouts for (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market people. They can afford -- and they'll be off the cost.\n\nGo ahead, Stan.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: I'm Mr. Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah. I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys. It's been an interesting ride to watch the healthcare system in the last 26 years. When my son was born, he was three and a half months premature, 26 years ago. And we had really good insurance. We basically didn\u2019t have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked. As time went on, you could kind of tell the healthcare system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA -- and I'm not going to call it the other word -- I call it the last President's healthcare program. I don\u2019t want to say that name.\n\nSo anyway --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Other than that, you like him a lot, right? (Laughter.)\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) It's gotten to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do. I actually ran for government so I could have insurance -- and won. But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening -- because everything has gone up. Utah didn\u2019t expand Medicaid -- we weren\u2019t a part of that -- and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the nation with states and companies and everybody else going bankrupt.\n\nSo it got to the point where I ended up -- not only with my businesses -- I have to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill. So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with healthcare. The last three -- well, the last three years --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So it's gone through the roof.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Oh, I got a $6,000 deductible -- HSA -- but I will meet that again in three months. So I'm at -- I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket. And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do. And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about -- and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease] community in your speeches -- is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year?\n\nSo I\u2019m sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for six or eight months, and I\u2019m going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease, for the same symptoms, for the same everything.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's interesting. Tom, could you answer that? That would be interesting.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: It\u2019s all about the risk and spreading the risk with insurance over a period of time. But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-business people, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the nation per capita. And Nucor would love to tell you thanks -- Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nucor has been very good. It\u2019s going to get better, too.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: And we've got a ton of those. The space program -- we used to make the shuttle boosters out of ATK Thiokal. And we\u2019d love to have the space program. I got a really good friend.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Those days are gone, but they're coming back.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: I\u2019ve got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia. But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States. So all those jobs I know will come back with you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you, he\u2019s a big believer in what you're saying -- right, Gary?\n\nMR. SUMMERS: If there\u2019s anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you. We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs. Just let us know where we can help.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you, Stan.\n\nMR. SUMMERS: Thank you for your time.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Would you have anything to say, Tom, generally speaking?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, let me start, Mr. President -- really powerful about the consequences of the current law, and you hear people\u2019s lives that have been affected in remarkably adverse ways that sometimes you don't think about as it relates to healthcare -- whether it\u2019s businesses that haven\u2019t been able to survive, or individuals who need to take three, four, five jobs; moms that can't be with their kids when they want. This is about real people. It\u2019s about real patients.\n\nAnd so working with you and your leadership, we are really excited about the opportunity to put in place a patient-centered system where patients and families and doctors are making decisions, and not Washington, D.C.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What about the concept that -- and everybody knows it\u2019s happening -- that Obamacare is imploding, that if we don't do anything, it\u2019s not even going to be around in another year? The insurance companies are fleeing. But now it seems to be getting this wonderful press like it\u2019s a wonderful thing, and it\u2019s a horrible thing actually, and getting worse. And \u201917 will be, by far, the worst year so far.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because a lot of things were put into \u201917. But \u201917 is going to be worse, and I assume \u201918 will be worse even than \u201917. So it\u2019s essentially gone. How do you respond to that? Because I\u2019ve been telling you, \"Why don't we wait? Just let it implode, and let\u2019s not take the blame.\" I\u2019ve been telling you that as an option. It\u2019s not an option I like, frankly, but it\u2019s certainly an option. How do you respond to that?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: I think \u201918 can be better if we implement the law and we utilize the regulatory process to make some --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m saying, if we don't implement the law, what happens with Obamacare? What\u2019s going on with Obamacare?\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: What you\u2019ll see is a magnification of all these stories around this table: more businesses being harmed, more individuals not having the kind of income that they -- disposable income that they would use, more moms and dads not able to care for their kids in the way that they believe to be most appropriate, more people getting insurance but no care. This is about real people\u2019s lives, and that's why it\u2019s so important.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Getting insurance but not being able to use it because the deductibles are so high.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: That's exactly right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you hear these stories where they're paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is. And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they're never going to be able to use it.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this fellow has to -- $13,000 before the insurance kicks in. That's what he has to pay -- $13,000.\n\nMR. SEIFE: That's like not having insurance.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: That's like not having insurance.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, keep working it.\n\nMS. SERTICH: They're catastrophic plans now.\n\nSECRETARY PRICE: Exactly.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s been working very hard, and he\u2019s doing a great job.\n\nMr. Vice President, do you have anything to say?\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr. President, I think what unequivocally these great Americans see in high relief is you're someone who puts people over politics. And I just want to thank all of them for coming, and in front of the national media, talking about the real world and impacts of Obamacare. You've said it consistently over the last two years that Obamacare has failed. But these people are emblematic of the Americans that Obamacare has failed. And I just am so grateful for their time, but so grateful for your compassionate leadership in driving the Congress and driving our nation toward better healthcare outcomes for them and better solutions built on those American principles of more consumer choices, more free market, but also, as you said, the caring for the most vulnerable by allowing our states to innovate and medicate in ways that will create even better healthcare coverage than they have today.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.\n\nQ Mr. President, do you have any message for those who are concerned about losing their insurance, whether it be Medicaid or higher costs (inaudible)?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It will get better. If we're allowed to do what we want to do, it will get better -- much better. Hopefully it will get very good.\n\nQ So will it take long?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It takes a period of time. Thank you, press.\n\nEND\n\n12:00 P.M. EDT", "comment_3": "President Trump Leads a Listening Session on Healthcare 3 13 17: https://t.co/Do6vmqbi2q via @YouTube", "split": "train"}

John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance, and an anecdote from his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\n\nJohn McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance\n\nIn light of the recent appeals court ruling in California, with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance, the following recollection from Senator John McCain is very appropriate:\n\n'The Pledge of Allegiance' - by Senator John McCain\n\n'As you may know, I spent five and one half years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. In the early years of our imprisonme nt, the NVA kept us in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell. In 1971 the NVA moved us from these conditions of isolation into large rooms with as many as 30 to 40 men to a room.\n\nThis was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change and was a direct result of the efforts of millions of Americans on behalf of a few hundred POWs 10,000 miles from home.\n\nOne of the men who moved into my room was a young man named Mike Christian.\n\nMike came from a small town near Selma , Alabama . He didn't wear a pair of shoes until he was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the US Navy. He later earned a commission by going to Officer Training School Then h e became a Naval Flight Officer and was shot down and captured in 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation of the opportunities this country and our military provide for people who want to work and want to succeed.\n\nAs part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some prisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were handkerchiefs, scarves and other items of clothing.\n\nMike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.\n\nEvery afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of t he cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nI know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event.\n\nOne day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it.\n\nThat evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could.\n\nThe cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room.\n\nAs I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to Pledge our allegiance to our flag and country.\n\nSo the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country.'\n\n'I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'\n\nPASS THIS ON... And on... And on! You can even send it back to me, I don't mind, because its worth reading again.\n\noh.....and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge...... Subject: Remember this picture on election day!\n\nLet's all remember this on election day...if you have family serving in the military, make sure you send it along. I don't care for Hillary, but at least she shows respect for the country she lives in! I had heard about this but a picture is definitely worth 1000 words! God save us!!!\n\nSenator Barack Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, Senator Hillary Clinton and Ruth Harkin stand during the national anthem.\n\nBarack Hussein Obama's photo (that's his real name).....the article said he REFUSED TO NOT ONLY PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, BUT REFUSED TO SAY THE PLEDGE.....how in the hell can a man like this expect to be our next C commander-in-Chief", "comment_3": "Have you gotten an email that says Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance?

Rand Paul\n\nRumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.\n\nOne of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.\n\nWe liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.\n\nRELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to war\n\nMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.\n\nBolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years \u2014 particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.\n\nJohn Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.\n\nNone of this is secret. It\u2019s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.\n\nBolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. \u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,\u201d Bolton said just last year.\n\nTrump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. \u201cIraq used to be no terrorists,\u201d Trump said in 2015. \u201c(N)ow it\u2019s the Harvard of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at Iraq from years ago, I\u2019m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,\u201d Trump said of Saddam Hussein, \u201cbut it was a lot better than it is right now.\u201d\n\nTrump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 \u201chelped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.\u201d In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.\n\nYou can\u2019t learn from mistakes if you don\u2019t see mistakes.\n\nTrump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS \u2014 but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.\n\nIn 2011, Bolton bashed Obama \u201cfor his refusal to directly target Gaddafi\u201d and declared, \u201cthere is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi\u2026 But Obama missed it.\u201d In fact, Obama actually took Bolton\u2019s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, \u201cWe came, we saw, he died.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied \u201c100 percent.\u201d Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.\n\nNo man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.\n\nAll nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn\u2019t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.\n\nWoodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, \u201cI hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.\u201d\n\nBolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that \u201che had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.\u201d But he\u2019s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: \u201cEven before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives\u2019 war-and-conquest agenda,\u201d notes The American Conservative\u2019s Jon Utley.\n\nAt a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.\n\nThe man is a menace.\n\nRELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans\u2019 top priority will be to repeal Obamacare\n\nOur Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.\n\nThe true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.\n\nRand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.", "comment_3": "Rand Paul: Will Donald Trump betray voters by hiring John Bolton? https://t.co/iWhK824ncA", "split": "train"}

Just one year after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, Friedman explained a plan for student school vouchers that would enhance and diversify K-12 education across the country. Friedman\u2019s plan, and much of the scholarship that it inspired, focused on the means by which all students would have access to equal and excellent educational opportunities. In 1990, the movement took a substantial step forward with the creation of the nation\u2019s first publicly financed urban school choice program, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.(link to page with state choice programs) Several similar initiatives were established in the years following, utilizing both the voucher and the tax credit model, with publicly funded and supported choice programs developing in areas such as Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Cleveland and Ohio. With the development of these programs came the institution of multiple state-based and national organizations (link to allies page) whose function was the protection and expansion of school choice. In 2002, the movement earned a momentous triumph with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the constitutionality of the Cleveland scholarship program in the 2002 Zelman v. Simmons-Harris decision. Throughout this period of tremendous growth, it became increasingly clear that the school choice movement would need to develop a national infrastructure and vision in order to achieve sustainable success. With this in mind, scholars, allies, philanthropists and activists discussed the creation of a single, national, high capacity initiative that could lead school choice into its most exciting era. After significant research and planning, on May 17, 2004 \u2013 the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education \u2013 this initiative became a reality, as the Alliance for School Choice was launched. The Alliance for School Choice is the only national policy organization devoted exclusively to promoting school choice programs that expand private sector opportunities, primarily for economically disadvantaged children. Together with its sister lobbying organization, Advocates for School Choice \u2013 and in close collaboration with state and national allies \u2013 the Alliance is devoted to assisting local efforts to implement successful and transformative school choice programs throughout the country. The Alliance for School Choice is the legacy of many years of advancing the cause of educational opportunity. Standing on the shoulders of giants such as Milton Friedman, strengthened by the pioneering work of countless allies, and empowered by the promises set forth in Brown v.

I have to thank our extraordinary Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, for taking the time to be here. (Applause.) And for her tireless efforts to keep our nation healthy.

But these stories that we've heard today, and all of us -- if we're not experiencing it, we know someone who is. These are the stories that remind us about what's at stake in this debate. This is really all that matters. This is why we are fighting so hard for health insurance reform. This is it. This is the face of the fight.\n\nAnd that's why I'd like to talk to you today. That's why I'm here. That's why reform is so critical in this country -- not tomorrow, not in a few years, but right now. People are hurting in this country right now.\n\nBut there is also a reason why I invited this particular group to talk today. There's a reason why we've invited the leaders not only from family advocacy groups and health care advocacy groups, but for so many organizations that have been fighting for decades for empowerment for women. And that's because when it comes to health care, as the Secretary said, as we all know, women play a unique and increasingly significant role in our families. We know the pain, because we are usually the ones dealing with it.\n\nEight in 10 women, mothers, report that they're the ones responsible for choosing their children's doctor, for getting them to their checkups, for managing that follow-up care. Women are the ones to do it. Mothers are the ones that do it. And many women find themselves doing the same thing for their spouses. (Laughter.) And more than 10 percent of women in this country are currently caring for a sick or elderly relative. It's often a parent, but it could a grandparent, or a mother -- or a relative of some sort -- but it's often a parent. So they're making critical health care decisions for those family members as well.\n\nIn other words, being part of the sandwich generation, is what we are now finding, raising kids while caring for a sick or elderly parent, that's not just a work/family balance issue anymore. It's not just an economic issue anymore. More and more it is a health care issue. It's something that I have thought a great deal about as a mother.\n\nI will never forget the time eight years ago when Sasha was four months that she would not stop crying. And she was not a crier, so we knew something was wrong. So we fortunately were able to take her to our pediatrician that next morning. He examined her and same something's wrong. We didn't know what. But he told us that she could have meningitis. So we were terrified. He said, get to the emergency room right away.\n\nAnd fortunately for us, things worked out, because she is now the Sasha that we all know and love today -- (laughter) -- who is causing me great -- excitement. (Laughter.)\n\nBut it is that moment in our lives that flashes through my head every time we engage in this health insurance conversation. It's that moment in my life. Because I think about what on earth would we have done if we had not had insurance. What would have happened to that beautiful little girl if we hadn't been able to get to a pediatrician who was able to get us to an emergency room? The consequences I can't even imagine. She could have lost her hearing. She could have lost her life if we had had to wait because of insurance.\n\nAnd it was also fortunate that we happened to have good insurance, right? Because if we hadn't had good insurance, like many of the panelists up here, we would have been saddled with costs for covering that emergency room visit for her two days in the hospital. We would have still been paying off those bills.\n\nAnd this issue isn't something that I've thought about as a mother. I think about it as a daughter. As many of you know, my father had multiple sclerosis. He contracted it in his twenties. And as you all know, my father was a rock. He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated. And I find myself thinking, what would we have done as a family on the South Side of Chicago if my father hadn't had insurance, if he hadn't been able to cover his treatments? What would it have done to him to think that his illness could have put his entire family into bankruptcy? And what if he had lost his job, which fortunately he never did? What if his company had changed insurance, which fortunately never happened, and we became one of the millions of Americans, families, who can't get insurance because of a preexisting condition?\n\nSo these are the thoughts that run through my mind as I watch this debate and hope that we get it right.\n\nBut let's be clear: Women aren't just disproportionately affected by this issue because of the roles that we play in families. As Tina and Kathleen mentioned, women are affected because of the jobs that we do in this economy. We all know that women are more likely to work part-time, or to work in small companies or businesses that don't provide any insurance at all.\n\nWomen are affected because, as we heard, in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender. And this is still shocking to me. These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night; that women in this country have been denied coverage because of preexisting conditions like having a C-section or having had a baby. In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.\n\nAnd a recent study showed that 25-year-old women are charged up to 45 percent more for insurance than 25-year-old men for the exact same coverage. And as the age goes up, you get to 40, that disparity increases to 48 percent -- 48 percent difference for women for the exact same coverage in this country.\n\nBut it's not just women without insurance, as we've heard, as we know who are affected. Plenty of women have insurance. But it doesn't cover basic women's health services like maternity care or preventative care like mammograms or pap smears, which we all know we have to have. We can't go without these basic services. But many insurance policies don't even cover it.\n\nOr policies cap the amount of coverage that you can receive, as you've heard, or it drops coverage when people get sick and they really need the care. Or maybe people have coverage but they're worried about losing it if they lose their jobs or if they change jobs or if the company changes insurance carriers. Out-of-pocket costs get higher and higher. It's hard to be able to plan your monthly bills when you don't know what your premiums are going to be. So a lot of people find they have to drop their insurance because they can no longer afford it.\n\nJust think about it. Many women are being charged more in health care coverage, but as we all know, women are earning less. We all know that women earn 78 cents on the dollar to every men -- to a man. So it's not exactly surprising when we hear statistics that more than half of women report putting off needed medical care simply because they can't afford it.\n\nNow, we have trouble putting ourselves first when we have the resources -- just making the appointment when you have insurance to get your regular screenings, to take care of those illnesses, those bumps and lumps and pains that we tend to ignore. But then not to be able to do it because you can't have insurance, you don't have insurance -- it's not surprising that so many millions of women around this country are simply going without insurance at all.\n\nSee, and the thing that we all know is that the current state -- this current situation is unacceptable. It is unacceptable. (Applause.) No one in this country should be treated that way. It's not fair. It's not right. And these are hard-working people we're talking about, right? People who care about their kids, care about their lives. And these circumstances could happen to any of us. This is one of those, \"There but for the grace of God go I\" kind of situations. None of us are exempt -- ever.\n\nSo I think it's clear that health insurance reform and what it means for our families is very much a women's issue. It is very much a women's issue.\n\nAnd if we want to achieve true equality for women, if that is our goal; if we want to ensure that women have opportunities that they deserve, if that is our goal; if we want women to be able to care for their families and pursue things that they could never imagine, then we have to reform the system. We have to reform the system. The status quo is unacceptable. It is holding women and families back, and we know it.\n\nFortunately, that is exactly what my husband's plan proposes to do, and it's important for us to understand some of the basic principles of that plan. Under his plan, if you don't have insurance now, or you lose your insurance at some point in the future, you'll be able to purchase affordable coverage through an insurance exchange -- a marketplace with a variety of options that will let you compare prices and benefits. This is exactly the approach that is used to provide members of Congress with insurance. So the thought is that if it's good enough for members of Congress, it should be good enough for the people who vote them in. (Applause.)\n\nAnd this is also an important part of the plan. If you already have insurance -- and it seems that there are a lot of people who are worried that they'll lose what they have under this plan -- but under this plan, if you already have insurance, you're set. Nothing changes. You keep your insurance, you keep your doctors -- and you're blessed. (Laughter.) This plan just puts in place some basic rules of the road to protect you from the kinds of abuses and unfair practices that we've heard.\n\nUnder this plan, insurance companies will never again be allowed to deny people like Debi and her son coverage for preexisting conditions. Sounds like a good thing. So whether you have breast cancer, diabetes, asthma, or hypertension -- or even just had a C-section, or some mental health treatment that you had in your past -- none of that will be a reason to refuse you coverage under the plan that my husband is proposing. Because when you're fighting an illness, he believes that you shouldn't also have to be in the process of fighting the insurance companies at the same time. (Applause.) It's a basic idea.\n\nUnder this plan, insurance companies will no longer be able to drop your coverage when you get too sick, or refuse to pay for the care that you need, or to set a cap on the amount of coverage that you can get. And it will limit how much they can charge you for out-of-pocket expenses, because getting sick in this country shouldn't mean that you go bankrupt. That's a basic principle of this plan.\n\nAnd finally, this plan will require insurance companies to cover basic preventative care. Seems simple. (Applause.) From routine checkups, to mammograms, to pap smears -- and this would come at no extra charge to the patient, so folks like Roxi can get the chance to get the kind of screenings that she needs to save her life, because we already know that if we catch diseases like cancer early -- we know this -- it's much less costly to treat, and we might just be able to save some lives. We know this.\n\nSo, under this plan, we can save lives and we can save money. It's not just good medicine but it's good economics as well.\n\nSo I think this is a pretty reasonable plan. I don't know about you. (Applause.) But I know many of you believe it's a good plan as well. And I know that many of the groups that you represent believe that what we're doing here, this fight, is important. It's important to this country, it's important to women, it's important to families that we succeed.\n\nAnd now more than ever, as Tina said, as Secretary Sebelius said, we need to act. No longer can we sit by and watch the debate take on a life of its own. It is up to us to get involved, because what we have to remember is that now more than ever, we have to channel our passions into change.\n\nThat's nothing that you all haven't done before, right? (Laughter.) You all have been the driving force behind so many of our greatest health care achievements, whether it's been children's health insurance; to funding breast cancer research, stem cell research; to passing the Family Medical Leave Act. The folks in this room, you're the ones that made those phone calls, right? That you wrote those letters, you knocked on those doors. You're the ones that helped make that happen.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we need you to do today for health insurance reform. We are going to need you over the next few weeks to mobilize like you've never mobilized before. We need you to educate your members about what the plan really is and what it isn't, because education is the key to understanding, and it's going to take phone calls to explain, to talk things through, to make sure that people understand not just what's at stake but what this all means.\n\nAnd we know there will be all sorts of myths and misconceptions about what the plan is and isn't, so it's so important that you make sure that people know the facts, and at least they make their decisions based on the truth of what this plan is and isn't. We need you to make your voices heard right here in Washington. And you all know how to do that. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd no, it won't be easy, because there are always folks who are a little afraid of change. We all understand that. We talked about this all during the campaign. Change is hard. Sometimes the status quo, even if it isn't right, feels comfortable because it's what we know. So it is understandable that people are cautious about moving into a new place in this society. There will always be folks who will want things to stay just the way they are, to settle for the world as it is. We talked about that so much. This is one of those times.\n\nBut look, I am here today, standing before you as the First Lady of the United States of America, because you all didn't settle for the world as it is, right? (Applause.) You refused to settle. And as a result of many of your efforts, as a young girl, I was able to dream in ways that I could have never imagined, that my mother could never have imagined, that my grandmother could never have imagined. And thanks to so many of you, I am raising these beautiful young women, you know -- (applause) -- who are going to be able to think so differently about their place in the world because of the work that you've done.\n\n\n\nHealth care reform is part of that movement. Health insurance reform is the next step. So we're going to need you all, focused and clear, picking up the phones, talking, calling, writing your congressmen and women, making this something that is the highest priority for all of us, so that we can make sure that every single family in this country can move forward as we hope that they can; that they don't have to worry about whether they can insure themselves. They don't have to worry about whether their kids are going to break an arm. That's what kids do, they break stuff. (Laughter.)\n\nSo I am grateful for all of you, for the work that you've done, and for what I know that we can do together over the next several weeks. But we have to be, what, fired up and what?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nMRS. OBAMA: And ready to go. A little fired up and ready to go. So thank you so much. God bless you all, and God bless America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:57 A.M. EDT\n\n", "comment_3": "Shame on @POTUS.

Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.\n\nWe think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.\n\nNow, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.\n\nTAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?\n\nGEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.\n\nTAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --\n\nGEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.\n\nTAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?\n\nGEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.\n\nTAPPER: So, before the election?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.\n\nAre you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?\n\nGEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.\n\nTAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.\n\nGEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.\n\nNow, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.\n\nTAPPER: By the private sector.\n\nGEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.\n\nTAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.\n\nGEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.\n\nAnd you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.\n\nTAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.\n\nGiven the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.\n\nTAPPER: Many of the details on the Wall Street Reform Bill that President Obama just signed will be determined by regulators. In fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.\n\nWhy should we be confident that they're going to get it right either with the rule making or next time there's a crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: Excellent question. But actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators. It does two very important things, though. It'll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nBut it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nation's largest institutions. That authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.\n\nTAPPER: Will these powers have allowed you, if had been Secretary of Treasury at the time or your predecessor Hank Paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think there's any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises. But if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily. It would have caused much less damage. It would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes Americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.\n\nTAPPER: You eluded to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created. Many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say there's one person they want for that job. Elizabeth Warren. The woman who thought it up.\n\nDo you support that idea?\n\nGEITHNER: She is a enormously effective advocate for reform. Probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country. She has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.\n\nTAPPER: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.\n\nGEITHNER: And even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of what's happening in the housing market and credit market. So she has enormous credibility and she'd be an excellent leader of that institution. But that's a decision the President's going to make.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the White House say that -- that you've had concerns about her appointment because she she's been a sharp critic of you, she's been a sharp critic of Treasury Department policies. Do you have concerns?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't have concerns and I should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis. You know, put out this financial fire.\n\nTAPPER: Ken Feinberg issued a report including that U.S. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown. Seventeen banks made these payouts after getting TARP funds, after getting bailout funds.\n\nGEITHNER: It's a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing. And that's what he reminded of which is in early '09, on the basis of performance in '08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Is there nothing that can be done about this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week. What he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward. So you didn't have taxpayers' money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.\n\nNow, what he's also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole. So, he's done a great job. Very tough judgments. Limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.\n\nTAPPER: Why is it that U.S. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called \"haircuts\"? Salary reductions, layoffs. And banks didn't. Banks -- I mean, you had Ken Feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving TARP money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted. How come banks didn't have to do that?\n\nGEITHNER: Great question. And that's why we have financial reform. Because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure. We did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.\n\nThat was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like AIG or Lehman or Bear Stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses. But what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority. A type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill. Banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures. We don't want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures. And we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.\n\nTAPPER: The Treasury Department issued a currency report and concluded that China was not manipulating its currency. Very few legislators on Capitol Hill seem to agree with that report, and I'm wondering if you agree with it.\n\nGEITHNER: Well, what China did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.\n\nNow, of course, they just started that process. It's just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of China's trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move. What matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.\n\nTAPPER: But you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that China is not manipulating its currency?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. But again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces. That's very good for China. It's very good for the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, this has been an odd week for the Obama administration -- not necessarily for the Treasury Department, but for the Obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with Shirley Sherrod and the Agriculture Department. President Obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration. Secretary Vilsack said something similar.\n\nDid you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, as the president said, I think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press. And I think I agree with it -- it's something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully. But he spoke to that, I thought, well earlier this week.\n\nTAPPER: Secretary Geithner, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nGEITHNER: Thanks, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie. Governor, thank you so much. Welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: I'm happy to be here.\n\nTAPPER: So, Governor, your victory last November in the very blue state of New Jersey was heralded by Republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories. Now, a lot of Republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent Democratic Governor Corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if, first of all, you agree with that. And, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what Republicans can do this November?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first off, Jake, I think what we did in New Jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in. We said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I didn't go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and I didn't think it was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, in terms of what it tells us going forward, I think Republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and I think that is the Republican brand. It's why I became a Republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as Republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in New Jersey and across the country.\n\nTAPPER: You know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in New Jersey. Here you are on CNBC.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: We passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our state's budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of New Jersey.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University, says, quote, \"That's a nice talking point, but it's absolutely untrue. There are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.\" And the Star-Ledger reported, \"Budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs. The budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern Christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the state's formula for education aid.\"\n\nSo these billions that you're not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat? How does this work? Because they're legal obligations, right?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, listen, the legislature passed this budget. The budget I presented on March 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the Corzine administration.\n\nAnd so Patrick Murray is a pollster, and he's OK as a pollster, but he's not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding. Well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the Corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole. Really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.\n\nAcross the board, Jake, we had to reduce spending. Every department of state government was cut. And so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.\n\nFinally, on pensions, I wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system. We need pension reform. I passed some already for new hires in March, and now this fall we're going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because we're going broke.\n\nTAPPER: Now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of New Jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate. That means that people's property taxes are going to go up.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, no, what we did, Jake, was we did a couple of things. First, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit. We spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people. We've eliminated that.\n\nAnd what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make. I wasn't going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; I wasn't going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class. Everything had to be cut.\n\nBut that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11.\n\nTAPPER: Now, that shared sacrifice -- I mean, is that not a tax increase, even if it's a -- I mean, if you're -- if you're taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, that's a tax increase, isn't it?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, I don't -- I don't see it that way. And in addition, what we did was we're giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this July by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that we're going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.\n\nTAPPER: OK, there's been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as you've been wielding your budget ax. Here's one example from a recent town hall meeting.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You're not compensating me for my education and you're not compensating me for my experience. That's...\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, you know what? Then you don't have to do it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Teachers do it because they love it. That's the only reason I do it.\n\nCHRISTIE: That's good. Well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you said your issue is with teachers' unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers' unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you don't really respect the teaching profession.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I do respect the teaching profession. I'm a product of the public schools in the state of New Jersey, and I care deeply about our public education.\n\nBut here's what we can't have any longer: We can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.\n\nFor instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent. They're getting no raises. They're getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers' unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in New Jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day they're hired until the day they die.\n\nNow, I have to tell you, Jake, we can't have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone who's being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession. By the way, you pay for this special treatment.\n\nI mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and it's direct, but candidly, that's what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in New Jersey and around the country.\n\nTAPPER: You're -- you've been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style. Here's an example of that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: Like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and I'm going to say things directly. When you ask me questions, I'm going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in New Jersey is going to have to wonder where I am on an issue.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: That's a high bar, so let's do it. Directly, straightly, bluntly, should New Jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the Obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?\n\nCHRISTIE: I have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit? Because with limited resources in New Jersey, I'm not going to throw good money after bad. And, secondly, what's the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of New Jersey? When I get answers back from them, I'll make a decision.\n\nTAPPER: What's your impulse?\n\nCHRISTIE: I don't have an impulse. I'm waiting to get briefed on it.\n\nTAPPER: Immigration reform. You've said this issue is too important to demagogue. Who is demagoguing in the Senate right now? And what is the solution to immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first of all, on demagoguing, I wasn't talking about anything that's going on now. That's a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in New Jersey at the time while I was U.S. attorney that I thought was demagoguery, and I called it that.\n\nListen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally. As a former United States attorney, I had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didn't have the resources to deal with them effectively.\n\nSo the president and the Congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.\n\nAnd until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesn't have the resources to do it effectively.\n\nTAPPER: Is the Republican Party in Congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think it depends on which Republican you're talking about. I don't think the party has had a generalized stance. I think there's been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue. And, candidly, I don't think there's one general Republican position.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there are Democrats offering a bill, and they can't -- they can't get any Republicans to join them.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus. And I think that's what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and I think that's the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.\n\nThat's what I've been doing in New Jersey, Jake. We have a Democratic legislature. I've passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a Democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a Democratic legislature, pension reforms with a Democratic legislature.\n\nIf you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and it's on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.\n\nTAPPER: Two more quick questions. One, the stimulus bill. Net positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think short-term positive, and we're now feeling the negative.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, I know you like to talk about New Jersey's cultural icons. You prefer to talk about Springsteen, but the New York Times today has this profile of Snooki from \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: Sure.\n\nTAPPER: MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: Negative for New Jersey, I mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of New Yorkers, who are -- most of the people on \"Jersey Shore\" are New Yorkers -- takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them at the Jersey shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey.\n\nI could tell people, they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time. The Jersey shore is a beautiful place, and it's a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer. We've got another six weeks or so of summer left. Come to New Jersey.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.\n\nCHRISTIE: Thank you, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: The roundtable is next with Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Donna Brazile, and Stephen Hayes. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately.\n\nSHERROD: I was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The full speech has been released by the NAACP, and it backs up Ms. Sherrod's version.\n\nTAPPER: Apparently she's watching this briefing, Shirley Sherrod, on CNN right now. Is there anything you want to say to her?\n\nGIBBS: On behalf of the administration, I offer our apologies.\n\nVILSACK: I asked for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.\n\n(UNKNOWN): He jumped the gun.\n\nSHERROD: To have people think that I was a racist really, really hurt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: L'affaire Sherrod, one of the many topics we'll talk about on our roundtable today with Stephen Hayes from the Weekly Standard and Fox News Channel, Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist and our dear friend, and ABC News' own Sam Donaldson, and, of course, Cokie Roberts.\n\nThanks, all of you, for being here.\n\nWe'll get to Sherrod in a second, but first I just want to talk a little bit about the Geithner interview. Secretary Geithner said he hopes there isn't going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier Americans. Is there going to be a fight?\n\nHAYES: Yes, hope will only take you so far. I think there will be a fight, and I think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate Democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.\n\nI think you're going to see moderate Democrats who walk back from the administration's eagerness to see this tax hike on what they're calling the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTAPPER: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: The 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. I think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package. Don't call it Bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, it's paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.\n\nTAPPER: Sam, where do you think this is going?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as Secretary Geithner said. And as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them. It really won't. They're going to have something to eat the next day.\n\nBut here's my proposal. There is a point...\n\nTAPPER: A proposal from Sam Donaldson.\n\nDONALDSON: Here's my proposal.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I like that.\n\nDONALDSON: There is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger. When our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes. Then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.\n\nROBERTS: Triggers never work. We've put in triggers -- Congress puts in triggers all the time. It's basically fig leaves, and then they don't -- they don't ever do it.\n\nDONALDSON: The reason it doesn't work, Cokie, is that Congress doesn't follow through.\n\nROBERTS: That's my point.\n\nDONALDSON: I don't think there's a chance that Republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... look, it's obviously not just an economic question. It's a political question. And -- and who gets to frame it? Do the Democrats get to say the Republicans claim that they're against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those Wall Street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the Republicans say, look, here are Democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of American life?\n\nAnd I think that's a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.\n\nTAPPER: And this debate comes as Ben Bernanke, the Fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.\n\nROBERTS: Including the market. I mean, he said those words and 200 points down.\n\nDONALDSON: The market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but Europe has produced better numbers just this past week. The earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, Caterpillar, some of the people who make things. I think we're going to come out of it.\n\nHAYES: But the numbers are mixed. I mean, that's the rosy scenario.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: The numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction. I think if you look at the big picture, the question I think facing -- facing sort of everybody in Washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with Tim Geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans won't have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.\n\nI think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what Tim Geithner just said, and one of those people is Christina Romer in the White House, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Of tax increases.\n\nHAYES: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current American Economic Review, June 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.\n\nROBERTS: Now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...\n\nDONALDSON: There is none.\n\nROBERTS: Well, there isn't one at the moment.\n\nTAPPER: There's not right now. And the heirs of George Steinbrenner are happy for that.\n\nROBERTS: Exactly. So then if they bring it back, they'd better do it overnight, you know, so that people aren't doing in their parents in anticipation.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, you wanted to say something?\n\nBRAZILE: Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate.\n\nSo I think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.\n\nROBERTS: But, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number. I mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about. And -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.\n\nAnd that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: There are two commissions...\n\nROBERTS: ... political problem.\n\nDONALDSON: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, we're going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we don't start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.\n\nROBERTS: Well...\n\nTAPPER: It's not just unnecessary expenses. Some of them are necessary expenses. It's Medicare and Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the Defense Department says is unnecessary?\n\nROBERTS: Well, you know perfectly well, Sam, that that doesn't save you any money. I mean, you start...\n\nDONALDSON: Oh, a few billion.\n\nROBERTS: You could close down this Capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and you'd still have a deficit because of Social Security, Medicare...\n\nDONALDSON: That's defense spending.\n\nROBERTS: ... and interest on the national debt.\n\nBRAZILE: And the loss of revenues. I mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy. We're not collecting money, so we need to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Particularly on capital gains.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right.\n\nHAYES: Which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth. And raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, I think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.\n\nAnd, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea. You've heard administration officials articulate this before, and it's behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: So sign on to the idea that now it's a bad idea, but at some point we're going to come out of this recession.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... and now they raised them, OK?\n\nTAPPER: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the Bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's what you were saying.\n\nTAPPER: ... or not, but Geithner said no.\n\nDONALDSON: But a trigger. Otherwise the Congress will never come back and say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.\n\nBRAZILE: I'm going to be like the Republicans for 30 seconds. How do we pay for it? How do we pay for it? We know that the Bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: It is -- it is part of it, but that's on static scoring. If you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that you'll make up some of the revenues...\n\nBRAZILE: So how many jobs were created during its period when we had the Bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008? How many jobs?\n\nHAYES: I don't -- I don't know the number.\n\nBRAZILE: Hardly any. We lost jobs. That's the point. The point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth. Bottom line, it's about jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nROBERTS: I think that's right. The question is, what cuts? And not just \"cuts.\" And I think that...\n\nHAYES: Sure, OK. Let's say that small business is the engine for job growth.\n\nBRAZILE: I agree with that.\n\nHAYES: But the people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners. So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can...\n\nDONALDSON: Most of the wealthy...\n\nHAYES: ... put people back to work, that's who you're talking about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... most of the wealthy, the top 3 percent are small-business owners? Wrong. There are some, yes, of course.\n\nBRAZILE: It's less than a quarter.\n\nDONALDSON: Come on, Stephen.\n\nTAPPER: We can have PolitiFact come in and weigh in on that one.\n\nBRAZILE: They will. Trust me.\n\nTAPPER: I do want -- I do want to move to the subject of the unemployed. And by the unemployed, I mean Shirley Sherrod, who is the most notable unemployed person in America right now. The White House says they had nothing to do with it, but Shirley Sherrod on CNN, after speaking to President Obama, said she wasn't so sure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I firmly believe that someone in the White House was telling them that the White House wanted me to resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Donna, the White House says, no, this was all Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's call. Do you believe that?\n\nBRAZILE: They've told me the same story, and...\n\nTAPPER: That's not what I asked you.\n\nBRAZILE: I know.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThey told me the same story, and I'm reluctant -- and I trust the source. My source said we had nothing to do with it, but, you know, once we got on top of it, we moved it.\n\nLook, Ms. Sherrod told a story that is just as amazing as the hymns from \"Amazing Grace.\" It was a story of redemption. And yet we all know from the facts that everyone, everyone -- there's enough pro (ph) to go around to ensure that everyone continue to eat bird until turkey season.\n\nBut the truth is, is that the White House jumped the gun, Fox News and others who allowed this -- this -- this bogus tape to hit the airwaves...\n\nROBERTS: NAACP.\n\nBRAZILE: ... and the NAACP...\n\nTAPPER: The NAACP, absolutely.\n\nBRAZILE: ... that did not call their local chapter, did not confer with Ms. Sherrod, it's a mind-boggling story. I talked to Ms. Sherrod. You know, when you grow up in the deep South, as I did, you know the -- you know the history of the movement and you know the history of the Sherrod family. You know Shirley Sherrod's personal story. I'm ashamed that so many people failed to even just simply Google her name.\n\nROBERTS: But the truth is, the only people who could fire her were the administration. Fox News couldn't fire her. The NAACP couldn't fire her. Only the administration could fire her. So they really bear the most culpability here, I think by a long shot.\n\nBut the other thing that's true is that what she actually did say gets us right back to the last conversation, because what she did say was that the divisions she came to understand were really not between black and white, but between haves and have-nots. And that is really what -- what turned her around and -- and made her fight for that white farmer.\n\nDONALDSON: But I think, except for her, there's enough blame to go around for everyone here. The people who maliciously and with intention misrepresented the facts, I mean, I -- I believe in the First Amendment. There's nothing you can do about them, although you wish for Joseph Welch to say as he did to Joe McCarthy when Joe McCarthy was destroying someone on television, have you no decency, at last?\n\nBut from the standpoint of Obama and the administration, who are these people that they should pay attention to and be afraid of? Who's Glenn Beck? I mean, who's Bill O'Reilly? Who's Brett whatever his name is?\n\nTAPPER: Andrew -- Andrew Breitbart...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: No, let me -- let me finish, because I want to give a little advice, since I've been doing it this morning in economics, to the president.\n\n(UNKNOWN): OK.\n\nDONALDSON: I want to quote another president who also said he had enemies, I'm going to -- of financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sexism. They are unanimous in their hatred for me, and I welcome their hatred, said Franklin Roosevelt, who said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\n\nSo, President Obama, don't be afraid of them. Take them on, and let the people judge. You may lose, but if you lose, you will lose grandly (ph).\n\nTAPPER: This is an argument you hear from a lot of liberal activists and Democratic activists. Josh Marshall, who writes at Talking Points Memo, wrote, speaking of Andrew Breitbart, who -- the blogger, the conservative blogger who originally posted this video, that -- the unfairly edited excerpt, which he says that's the -- that's the way he got it, was in that unfairly edited excerpt, and this is what Josh Marshall wrote.\n\n\"Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify. To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong.\"\n\nStephen, do you think that this -- that liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists or...\n\nHAYES: No, way. They would never do that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean, Donna's colleague, Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this. Senior vice president of news, Michael Clemente, sent out a memo talking about the need to treat this carefully, to gather all the facts.\n\nLook, it's an easy distraction. That's what they want to do. I understand that.\n\nThe basic point, to go back to what Donna said, involves the speech, and the speech was -- you know, for -- for most of the speech, a fantastic speech, a compelling speech, a moving speech. I mean, to hear the stories about Baker County, to hear about her upbringing, to hear about the men who burned crosses in her front yard, is a compelling story. It's incredibly moving.\n\nWhat happened then in the speech was that she slipped into what I think are easy accusations of racism that don't work. She said, in the -- in the middle of her speech...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: This is the speech in March, the March speech, yes.\n\nHAYES: ... the March speech, she talked about Republicans. It's always about money, she said. I haven't seen such mean-spirited people as I've seen lately over the issue of health care. Some of the racism we thought was buried, didn't it surface? Now we've endured eight years of the Bushes, and we didn't do some of the stuff these Republicans are doing because you have a black president.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Bill O'Reilly called for her to be fired. Isn't (ph) he on Fox...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: So did the White House. So did the USDA.\n\nROBERTS: But there was racism that came up during the health care debate, with the -- with the vilification of John Lewis at the Capitol. And -- and the truth is, is that -- you know, this is a conversation we -- we just don't have.\n\nI mean, I really think Eric Holder was right. We are cowardly about talking about race.\n\nI had a cross burned in my front yard, too, and I know what it was like to grow up in the South in those years. And -- and the truth is that the -- that the conversation is just different among whites and among blacks. It is. And we have to be able to address that if we're ever going to get past it as a nation.\n\nIf we have any opportunity to perfect this union, that's what we have to do.\n\nHAYES: I agree with you, but don't you think one of the reasons that we don't have this kind of conversation about race is because of the kind of comments branding Republicans as racists for opposing health care?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: This has -- this has nothing to do...\n\nDONALDSON: Mr. Beck called the president of the United States a racist. What about that?\n\nTAPPER: But is that racist, to say somebody's racist?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, he just said branding people as racists.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: What she was -- what she was saying -- I heard the speech in its entirety, and I went public when I heard the speech. What she was talking about was the political climate, a political climate that, yes, some in the Republican Party have condoned simply because they refuse to repudiate those elements within their party that simply have gone too far, with the birther notion, with his illegitimacy, and creating the kind of racial resentment that prohibits us from having a genuine conversation about race and racism.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, Shirley Sherrod on CNN also said something specifically about Andrew Breitbart from biggovernment.com, the conservative activist who posted the unfairly edited video, and here's what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I know I've gotten black versus white. He's probably the person who's never gotten past it and never attempted to get past it. I think he'd like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery. That's where I think he'd like to see all black people end up again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: This woman's been offered a job by the Agriculture Department as a deputy director of the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and she's saying Andrew Breitbart wants to return to the days of slavery.\n\nNow, you can think what Andrew Breitbart did was reprehensible, irresponsible, unfair, and a total smear. Did that justify saying he wants us to go back to the days of slavery?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- to second-guess Ms. Sherrod. I know her history. But I am going to say that Mr. Breitbart should resign, even after -- not resign...\n\nROBERTS: From what?\n\nBRAZILE: Sorry, I misspoke. I'm not in the business of asking people to be fired. I've been fired once before. But I think Mr. Breitbart should apologize to her.\n\nI mean, she -- this is a woman who -- her father was murdered, and no one was ever brought to justice. I mean, she has some -- she has some anger that she was talking about, but she also talked about how she got -- you know, how she came to struggle with this and how she went on to -- to -- to start her life anew and fight for farmers of (inaudible)\n\nBut let me just say, going back to this conversation, can we have a conversation about race? Yes. But it cannot start here in Washington. It cannot start with politicians leading the conversation. It must start back in Georgia, where Ms. Sherrod and the Spooners can help lead us in this dialogue.\n\nAnd if Mr. Breitbart would like to be part of it, we welcome him to the conversation.\n\nROBERTS: But it's -- I disagree. I think it can start in Washington, and I think it can start in the White House. And I think that we -- that we have an opportunity -- everybody talks about this being a teachable moment. Well, let's learn and -- and let's have the president be the teacher in -- in chief. And, you know...\n\nDONALDSON: Yes. And Mitch McConnell was asked about an aspect of this, and he says, I don't want to get into that. All right. That's his privilege not to as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. But it takes all the sides to get into it civilly, not calling names or calling people racists on either side -- you're quite correct -- and talk about it. But it's not going to happen, unfortunately.\n\nBRAZILE: But civil rights used to be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nBRAZILE: It wasn't black or white or left versus white. It was Republicans. I keep telling Republicans, it was Republicans who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... listen to the Johnson tapes, when Johnson was ready to sign the civil rights bill, it was, you know, dead of summer, and -- and he's saying to his aides, make sure that the Republicans are here. I'm not going to sign this without Ev Dirksen being in the room, because this is the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader...\n\nROBERTS: ... they -- they had so much to do with it.\n\nDONALDSON: Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader of the Senate, made the last speech in favor of breaking the southern filibuster to pass the '64 Civil Rights Act. He quoted Victor Hugo. Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. That's the way the Republicans in the Senate acted.\n\nBRAZILE: But I hope Ms. Sherrod and Mr. Breitbart can sit down and have a -- whatever kind of summit.\n\n(UNKNOWN): A beer summit?\n\nBRAZILE: I don't know what she drinks.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... don't want to get into this.\n\nBRAZILE: But I know that they can find a common language to talk about the future if they can only sit and listen to each other.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I want to ask you a question about -- Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times suggests that she should -- Shirley Sherrod should be offered a job in the White House. And she also writes this: \"The first black president should expand beyond his campaign security blanket, the smug cordon of overprotective white guys surrounding him. Otherwise, this administration will keep tripping over race, rather than inspiring on race. The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give here a new job, director of black outreach. This White House needs one.\"\n\nWhether or not the job should go to Shirley Sherrod, does this White House need one?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I would hope that the White House could bring in more people, people who understood history, people who could help serve this president. When they hear of a conversation like Ms. Sherrod, hopefully they won't run to the hilltop. They could sit down and say let's -- let's talk about this.\n\nI -- I know from having talked to Valerie Jarrett that she's deeply concerned and that she's working inside the White House to make sure that this never happens again.\n\nDONALDSON: But, Jake, it's not black outreach. Maureen, please, it's outreach on this issue for blacks and whites and people of all colors.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Of all colors.\n\nDONALDSON: To say, all right, we need someone for black outreach is the wrong direction.\n\nTAPPER: Stephen?\n\nHAYES: Well, yes, I mean, I don't think -- I think that Sam's right. I don't think that necessarily creating a new position of black outreach is -- is going to solve the country's problems on race. And certainly after looking at Ms. Sherrod, in spite of her history and the things that she said that were so moving, after seeing her comments about Andrew Breitbart wanting us to go back to slavery, would not be the ideal person for the job.\n\nTAPPER: Cokie, 30 seconds.\n\nROBERTS: Well, no, I think that the basic point that there has been an ignorance in some ways of -- of the immediate past history that some of us lived through of the young people in the White House is true and that -- and that there does need to be a better understanding of that in order to -- to just try to -- to salve the wounds.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Wonderful job, guys. Thank you so much. The roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com and on our new iPad app, where later you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with PolitiFact to fact-check the show.", "comment_3": "Current Employment Statistics Highlights March 2010: 1. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.\n\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\n\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\n\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\n\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\n\nAnd in a place\u2026 with absolutely no ceilings.\n\nYou know, President Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\u2019s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\n\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\u2019s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \u201cEquality of opportunity\u2026 Jobs for those who can work\u2026 Security for those who need it\u2026 The ending of special privilege for the few\u2026 The preservation of civil liberties for all\u2026 a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds good to me.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\n\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\n\nIt\u2019s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\n\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\n\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\n\nWe\u2019re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\n\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\n\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs\u2026 you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2013 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\n\nSo we\u2019re standing again. But, we all know we\u2019re not yet running the way America should.\n\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\n\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\n\nSo, you have to wonder: \u201cWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\nI say now.\n\nProsperity can\u2019t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\n\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\n\nYou brought our country back.\n\nNow it\u2019s time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\n\nAnd, you know what?\n\nAmerica can\u2019t succeed unless you succeed.\n\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\n\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\n\nI\u2019m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\n\nFor the successful and the struggling.\n\nFor the innovators and inventors.\n\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\n\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\n\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\n\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\n\nFor the veterans who served our country.\n\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\n\nFor everyone who\u2019s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\n\nI\u2019m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\n\nOur country\u2019s challenges didn\u2019t begin with the Great Recession and they won\u2019t end with the recovery.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\n\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\n\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value\u2026 too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\n\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\u2019ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\n\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\u2019ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\n\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\n\nAt our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We\u2019re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change, we harness it.\n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\n\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\n\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2026\n\nA song called \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay\u2026 and we need a place to hide away\u2026 They believe in yesterday.\n\nAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\n\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\n\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d Well, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\n\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\n\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\n\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\n\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\n\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \u201ca village\u201d that has a place for everyone.\n\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\n\nI believe that success isn\u2019t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty\u2026\n\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive\u2026\n\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt\u2026\n\nHow many people find a good job\u2026\n\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\n\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\n\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\n\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\n\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\n\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\n\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\n\nTo meet every challenge.\n\nTo be resilient\u2026 no matter what the world throws at you.\n\nTo solve the toughest problems.\n\nI believe we can do all these things because I\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\n\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\u2019t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\n\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\n\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\n\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\n\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\n\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\n\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\u2019t quite so hard for families like hers?\n\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\n\nIf you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll wage and win Four Fights for you.\n\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\n\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\n\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nIs this possible in today\u2019s world?\n\nI believe it is or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\n\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\u2019t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\n\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\n\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\n\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\n\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\u2019s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll propose specific policies to:\n\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2013 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\n\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\n\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\n\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\n\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\n\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping renewable power \u2013 wind, solar, advanced biofuels\u2026\n\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings\u2026\n\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment\u2026\n\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\n\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\n\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\n\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that talent is universal \u2013 you can find it anywhere \u2013 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\n\nOur country won\u2019t be competitive or fair if we don\u2019t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\n\nSo let\u2019s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\n\nLet\u2019s make college affordable and available to all \u2026and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\n\nLet\u2019s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\n\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America\u2019s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd today\u2019s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\n\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\n\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\n\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\n\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\n\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\n\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\n\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\n\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\n\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\n\nYou know, America\u2019s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\u2019s drawn so many to our shores. What\u2019s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\n\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America\u2019s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2013 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\n\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\n\nAs your President, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\n\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\n\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\u2019s threats and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\u2019ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\u2019ve earned.\n\nI\u2019ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\n\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\n\nMeeting today\u2019s global challenges requires every element of America\u2019s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\n\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\u2019s a lot of good news out there too.\n\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\n\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\u2019s why we have to win the fourth fight \u2013 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\n\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\n\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\u2019s right to vote, rather than every corporation\u2019s right to buy elections.\n\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\n\nI\u2019ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\n\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\n\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\n\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2013 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\n\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\n\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\n\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\u2019ll also stand my ground when I must.\n\nThat\u2019s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it\u2019s something I will always do as your President.\n\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\u2019s back.\n\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\n\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \u201cHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\u201d\n\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2013 even killed \u2013 not hired as Secretary of State.\n\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\u2019s how we do it in America.\n\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\n\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\n\nWe can strengthen our families.\n\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\n\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\n\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\n\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n\nText \u201cJOIN\u201d J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.\n\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\u2019m not stopping now.\n\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I\u2019ve seen it up close and personal.\n\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\n\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\n\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\n\nAnd one additional advantage: You\u2019re won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\u2019m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\n\nAnd along the way, I\u2019ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\u2019t get everything right. Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out!\n\nAnd I certainly haven\u2019t won every battle I\u2019ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\n\nI think you know by now that I\u2019ve been called many things by many people \u2014 \u201cquitter\u201d is not one of them.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\n\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\u2019d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nI can still hear her saying: \u201cLife\u2019s not about what happens to you, it\u2019s about what you do with what happens to you \u2013 so get back out there.\u201d\n\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\n\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\n\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2013 not just some, but all \u2013 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\n\nNot only because we\u2019re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\u2019re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\n\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\n\nI wish she could have seen the America we\u2019re going to build together.\n\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\n\nWhere we don\u2019t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\n\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\n\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.", "comment_3": "Missed @HillaryClinton's Campaign Launch Speech?

Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.\n\n\"When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,\" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.\"\n\nThe Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.\n\n\"It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,\" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.\n\nMesser admitted it's \"big dollars, but it's a question of priorities.\" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.\n\n\"Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,\" Messer said.\n\nMexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.\n\nIf Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.\n\nNo decisions have been made, GOP sources said.\n\nRepublicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.\n\nThe thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.\n\n\"We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,\" Scalise said. \"We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.\"\n\nCould Mexico pay for the border wall?\n\nTrump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall's full cost.\n\nAccording to Trump's website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.\n\nA major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.\n\nTotal US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax.\n\nMoving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that \"even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year.\" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.\n\nThe biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.\n\nTrump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles.\n\n\"The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,\" says Callan. \"The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.\"\n\nThe size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.", "comment_3": "Trump is so full of sh*t: Trump asking Congress, not Mexico, to pay for border wall @CNNPolitics https://t.co/P55Dupa1Mt", "split": "train"}

Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans -- the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence.\n\n\n\nIn my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won't forget.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are -- victims of land mines, children born in poverty and with birth defects -- shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady.\n\n\n\nWhen I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.\n\n\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.\n\n\n\nFinally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement.\n\n\n\nBut let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.\n\n\n\nThese are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.\n\n\n\nAnd I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\n\n\n\nShe knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming.\n\n\n\nI'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you.\n\n\n\nYou know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.\n\n\n\nI've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.\n\n\n\nI fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.\n\n\n\nThanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans.\n\n\n\nI don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.\n\n\n\nI fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills.\n\n\n\nI fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master's Degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me.\n\n\n\nI fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies.\n\n\n\nI fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles.\n\n\n\nWe're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.\n\n\n\nWe believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\n\n\n\nWe believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.\n\n\n\nI will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\n\n\n\nMy tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\n\n\n\nKeeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity.\n\n\n\nI know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away.\n\n\n\nWe will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.\n\n\n\nEducation is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.\n\n\n\nWhen a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm President, they will.\n\n\n\nMy fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.\n\n\n\nThis great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce.\n\n\n\nToday, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve.\n\n\n\nWe have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\n\n\n\nWe face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace.\n\n\n\nWhen I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.\n\n\n\nI'm running for President to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals -- to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.\n\n\n\nIn America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\n\n\n\nWe need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\n\n\n\nInstead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.\n\n\n\nWe're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit.\n\n\n\nI've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.\n\n\n\nLong ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love.\n\n\n\nOn an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me.\n\n\n\nThen I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.\n\n\n\nI was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down.\n\n\n\nA lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me.\n\n\n\nWhen they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with. Because every day they fought for me.\n\n\n\nI fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.\n\n\n\nI'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.\n\n\n\nIf you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.\n\n\n\nI'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\n\n\n\nFight for what's right for our country.\n\n\n\nFight for the ideals and character of a free people.\n\n\n\nFight for our children's future.\n\n\n\nFight for justice and opportunity for all.\n\n\n\nStand up to defend our country from its enemies.\n\n\n\nStand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.\n\n\n\nStand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\n\n\nThank you, and God Bless you.", "comment_3": "John McCain Slams 'Half-Baked, Spurious Nationalism' in Liberty Medal Acceptance Speech - TIME https://t.co/Nl3FEUttfe", "split": "train"}

We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.\n\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\n\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.\n\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\n\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\n\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\n\nTRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\n\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\n\nYou say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\n\nBut I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\n\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\n\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\n\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\n\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\n\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\n\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\n\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.\n\nWe\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\n\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\n\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\n\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\n\nCLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.\n\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\n\nI\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\n\nTRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?\n\nRADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.\n\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\n\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\n\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\n\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\n\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\n\nCLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\n\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\n\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\n\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\n\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\n\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: In the first debate\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.\n\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nTRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\n\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\n\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\n\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\n\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\n\nCLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\n\nCLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.\n\nCLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.\n\nCLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.\n\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\n\nCLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\n\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\n\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.\n\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We brought up the e-mails.\n\nTRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.\n\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\n\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\n\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\n\nBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\n\nNumber three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\n\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\n\nRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\n\nObamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\n\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\n\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\n\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time\u2026\n\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\n\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\n\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\n\nTRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.\n\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\n\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nAnd she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\n\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\n\nCLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.\n\nIt\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\n\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\n\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..\n\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026 TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\n\nRADDATZ: I do.\n\nTRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?\n\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\n\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\n\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\n\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: So, please\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\n\nTRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.\n\nRADDATZ: She did not.\n\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\n\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.\n\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\n\nBut, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.

And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nCLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 with the Russians and other foreign powers.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.\n\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.\n\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\n\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\n\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.\n\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.\n\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\n\nBut \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\n\nWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\n\nBut we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\n\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\n\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\n\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\n\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nCLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\n\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\n\nCOOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\n\nTRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.\n\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.\n\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.\n\nCOOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\n\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.\n\nHey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nCOOPER: In the past\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.\n\nTRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.\n\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.\n\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\n\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\n\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\n\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\n\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\n\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which\u2026\n\nCLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were\u2026\n\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\n\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\n\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\n\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\n\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\n\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\n\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\n\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\n\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\n\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\n\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\n\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\n\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country?\n\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\n\nTRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.\n\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\n\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\n\nNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\n\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.\n\nI do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Everything.\n\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\n\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.\n\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.\n\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\n\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\n\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\n\nTRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.\n\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.\n\nLet me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\n\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\n\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\n\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\n\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\n\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?\n\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\n\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you.\n\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\n\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\n\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\n\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\n\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\n\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens\u2026\n\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.\n\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\n\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to\u2026\n\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.\n\nCLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another\u2026 TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.\n\nTRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\n\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\n\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\n\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\n\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\n\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\n\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\n\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\n\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.\n\nSo I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.\n\nI ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\n\nIt\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.\n\nCLINTON: Well\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.\n\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\n\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\n\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\n\nI will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\n\nYou take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\n\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\n\nYou know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\n\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\n\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We have\u2026\n\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\n\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\n\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\n\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\n\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.", "comment_3": "Read @PolitiFact\u2019s annotated transcript of the second presidential #debate https://t.co/I6GAS700g7", "split": "train"}

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are \u201cnot a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high\u2026. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers \u2013 since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2013\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Kathleen Sebelius\n\nSecretary\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\n200 Independence Ave., SW\n\nWashington, DC 20201\n\n\n\nRE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates\n\n\n\nDear Secretary Sebelius,\n\n\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.\n\n\n\nAs you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.\n\n\n\nAs of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida\u2019s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS\u2019s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.\n\n\n\nIndeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.\n\n\n\nOver 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida\u2019s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.\n\n\n\nWhile other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers \u2013 since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # e\n\nRelated News House Passes Deutch Amendment to Promote Awareness of Mental Health and Addiction Parity Laws\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview rr\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview Deutch, Castor, FL Democrats Ask Gov.

Did they bring down that Russian plane?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?\n\nOBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.\n\nAnd this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.\n\nBut this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it?\n\nOBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit.\n\nWhat makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it means\n\nOBAMA: with respect to ISIL.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: that Vladimir Putin will start to take them on?\n\nOBAMA: Well Putin, I think, from the start has been sincere in seeing ISIL as a threat. The reason he went into Syria is not primarily because of ISIL, but to prop up Assad. And part of our goal is to underscore for him and for everyone in the region that ISIL is the primary threat and you can't solve the ISIL problem if, in fact, you've got a country that is governed by somebody who's illegitimate and that the majority of Syrians reject.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Big meeting this weekend. Can you convince him?\n\nOBAMA: What's interesting is we've already seen I think a growing awareness on the part of the Russians after several weeks now of fairly high paced bombing that they're not going to win this militarily. I think they understand that. They may not admit it publicly, but you're already starting to see indications of that.\n\nAnd it is a modestly positive sign that they've engaged with us, the Saudis the Turks and others to try to broker a political transition plan. Now, they have not yet come to the conclusion that Assad can't be part of a new Syria. And I think it's going to take some time for them to get there. But our goal here, and John Kerry, I think's, done outstanding work in starting to create a platform and a set of principles whereby we agree that a political s solution is what's required, that it has to be inclusive, that there's going to be a transition phase.\n\nAnd, by bringing in the Iranians and the Russians, which is tough for us and tough for a number of our coalition allies they're now at the table. We're starting to shape who are the groups that could responsibly govern Syria. And if we can keep pushing on that diplomatic track even as we're squeezing ISIL in places like the Sinjar operation that's currently taking place then what you see over the course of the next year is I think the possibility that our 60-member coalition and the approach that we're taking is one that Russia determines\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But the coalition hasn't all stepped up. And some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down.\n\nOBAMA: I think what is true is that this has always been a multi-year project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in in sufficient numbers so simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?\n\nOBAMA: Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria it they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain.\n\nWhat we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters. But one of the things that I'll be talking about when I see President Erdogan in Turkey and discuss this with the G20 is that we've still got to do more work in controlling the border so that the influx of foreign fighters is much more reduced.\n\nAnd you know, what we also have to do is frankly work with the Iraqis to strengthen their capabilities. Because one of the big challenges throughout this campaign has been that the Iraqi military has proven itself to be effective in protecting Baghdad. But it's much harder for them, because they're primarily Shia, to move out into Sunni areas. And part of our goal has to be to recruit more effective Sunni partners in Iraq to really go on offense rather than simply engage in defense.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So what do you think when you hear someone like Ben Carson get up in a debate and say, \"Hey, this would be easy. We can take ISIL out just by bombing their oil fields in Anbar,\" that's what a general told him.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. What I think is that he doesn't know much about it. And look George, I think it's fair to say that over the last several years I've had access to all the best military minds in the country and all the best foreign policy minds in the country. And I'm not running for office. And so my only interest is in success.\n\nAnd if I'm down in the Situation Room talking with people who have worked in these regions and have run major military operations from the chairman of my joint chiefs of staff Joe Dunford to, you know, individuals like General Allen, who was involved in Iraqi operations back in 2007/2008, and they don't think it's easy, then it's probably not easy.\n\nAnd what we've been able to do is to shape a strategy that first and foremost contained the momentum that ISIL had gained. We are now in a position where slowly, incrementally we're pushing back against areas where we know we've got some solid partners like the Kurds and the Peshmerga. But until we get the Syria political situation resolved and until Assad is no longer a lightning rod for Sunnis in Syria and the that entire region is not longer a proxy war for Shia/Sunni conflict we're going to continue to have problems\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That could take a generation.\n\nOBAMA: Well I would distinguish between making sure that the place is perfect. That's not going to happen anytime soon with making sure that ISIL continues to shrink in its scope of operations until it no longer poses the kind of threat that it does, not just primarily to us, but to neighbors in the region like Jordan or Saudi Arabia and that the humanitarian crisis that's taking place with millions of people who are fleeing the country that that can be relieved.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You're not running for office. But as you know, the Republican candidates are putting your foreign policy on the ballot. They say the Obama/Clinton legacy is a more dangerous world because you're weak and America has failed to lead. If you were up on that stage, how would you respond?\n\nOBAMA: Well, what I would say is that America is not weaker; it's stronger around the world than when I came into office. And that can be measured by the influence that we have on a whole range of transnational issues, the cooperation that we get on not just counterterrorism, but on critical issues like climate change the work that we're doing in Asia that I'll be traveling to talk about in terms of creating the kinds of rule based systems that preserve our freedom of navigation and try to push back against Chinese efforts that may threaten the peace and prosperity of the region.\n\nYou know, there was a lot of talk among these Republicans about the success of Putin's strategy in the Ukraine. But in fact, because we were able to mobilize the entire international community, we've been able to you know, not only reduce the fighting in Ukraine, but now we're still on track to potentially resolve that peacefully. So you know, one of the things that's striking to me, George, is that pub public opinion around the world about the United States is significantly higher than it was when I came into office.\n\nWe have not seen the kinds of big threats against the United States that sadly we saw during something like 9/11. We've been able to take more than 180,000 troops or 150, 60, 70,000 troops out of harm's way while still maintaining coalition partnerships. And in everywhere from Latin America to Africa we helped to shape the agenda for a more peaceful, prosperous world. So when you hear rhetoric like this, George, about America's never been in greater danger that's rhetoric. That's campaign talk.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But when you think about it, when you reflect on it, where have you fallen short? You didn't expect to have several thousand troops in Afghanistan, more than 3,500 troops in Iraq.\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think actually in Afghanistan let's take Afghanistan as an example. I don't think any of us were ever under any illusion that we could withdraw every single troop out of Afghanistan and that country, which is one of the poorest in the world, that has gone through 30 or 40 year so fighting would be completely stable.\n\nOur very premise, our strategy was always that we were going to have to provide the kinds of advice the kinds of training, the kinds of military support that would be required so that this nascent democracy began to work. And that's exactly what we're doing. I when I consider where we have fallen short, what is absolutely true is that in the Middle East and in Syria in particular the you know, enormous changes that took place post Arab Spring were ones that don't happen, you know, every ten years. They happen every 50, 60, 70 years. And we have not been able to get the kind of success on the ground with countries that were fragile to begin with that were governed by dictators to create the kind of civil society that would allow for a functioning, if not perfectly democratic, then at least civil society and government.\n\nAnd you know, that's humbling. But it's hard. And when you hear the Republicans talk about well, you know, we'd go in and fix this right away. We're going to win in Middle East. What's clear is that you don't have any sense of how difficult it is. And they don't have a lot of sense of history, including the recent history of our efforts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Lot of talk about immigration as well. Donald Trump is speaking about history. He wants to bring back Operation Wetback from President Eisenhower and deportation force. What would that mean?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think the name of the operation tells you something about the dangers of looking backwards. And the notion that we're going to deport 11, 12 million people from this country, first of all I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money's going to come from. It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that. Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children and putting them in what, detention centers and then systematically sending them out. Nobody thinks that that is realistic, but more importantly, that's not who we are as Americans.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think when you hear people cheer for that?\n\nOBAMA: Well, what I think is that there's always been a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in America, ironically from folks who themselves two generations back or even one generation back were immigrants themselves. And it's the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment. Now, those sentiments get stronger when people feel insecure.\n\nAnd given what happened in 2007, 2008, given the fact that despite the recovery, I think people still have some post-traumatic stress and are still concerned about prospects for jobs and economic security in the future it's easy to play on those fears. But that's not that's not what you want from your president.\n\nAnd to their credit Republican and as well as Democratic senators and or presidents in the past, including Ronald Reagan, including George H.W. Bush, including George W. Bush have understood that we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants and that proposing radical and necessarily cruel solutions to a problem that can be solved by some good, old-fashioned legislation of the sort that passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and I would've been able to sign two years ago if the House Republicans had allowed it to come to the floor 'cause there was a majority on that floor to vote for it we don't want I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say we're a nation of laws. On the issue of Guantanamo, one of your big promises, closing Guantanamo Speaker Ryan says you can't close it on your own, don't have the authority. He says the law is the law. Do you have the authority to close it on your own?\n\nOBAMA: Well, here's what I know is that we need to close it. That's not just my opinion. If you take a survey of retired generals folks who are currently in uniform they will tell you that this is a consistent recruitment tool for jihadists. It is contrary to our values. It costs huge amounts of money. And it's not sustainable\n\nOBAMA: so it is my--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: did on your own.\n\nOBAMA: So it is my job to, first and foremost, work with Congress to try to find a solution. And what we've been able to do during the course of this administration is to systematically transfer and draw down the numbers who are there. My hope is that by the end of this year we are seeing close to under 100 prisoners remaining and detainees remaining. And then my intention is to present to Congress a sensible, plausible plan that will meet our national security needs and be consistent with who are\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And when they say no?\n\nOBAMA: Well they I'm not going to one of the things that I've been consistently trying to do is to give Congress the chance to do the right thing before I then look at my next options. And Congress is going to have an opportunity, I think when they look at the numbers, when they look at how much it costs for us to detain these individuals, when they hear from both current and retired military officers who say this is not what we should be doing they're going to have the ability to make their own assumptions.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you're not ruling out doing it on your own?\n\nOBAMA: My job right now is to make sure that Congress has a chance to look at a serious plan and look at all the facts and we'll take it from there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Will you rule out executive action?\n\nOBAMA: We'll take it from there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You've called Hillary Clinton a good friend, strong friend, one of America's finest secretaries of state and said she'd make a great president. So is it fair for Democrats to conclude she's your candidate?\n\nOBAMA: (LAUGH) George, I'm not going to make endorsements when, you know, I've said in the past it's important for the process to play itself out. I think Dem I think Hillary's doing great. I think, you know, Bernie Sanders is really adding to this debate--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Would he make a great president?\n\nOBAMA: -- in a very serious way. You know, I think Bernie is capturing a sense among the American people that they want to know the government's on their side, that it's not bought and paid for, that you know, our focus has to be on hard working, middle class Americans not getting' a raw deal. And I think that is in in incredibly important. I think Martin O'Malley has important things to say. So we'll let this process play out. I am confident that we're going to have a good, strong Democratic candidate, and that they'll be able to win in November.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally-- when you were a student, you spoke out, you protested apartheid in South Africa. If you were on the campus of University of Missouri today, would you be a protestor?\n\nOBAMA: (SIGH) Without knowing all the facts I've read enough to know that there is clearly a problem at-- the University of Missouri. And, that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest-- what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. I want-- an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry. And-- the issue is just making sure that-- even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out-- that they're also listening. And, you know I'd rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive. I think that what you saw with the University of Missouri football team, and the coach, you know, standing up for something that they think is right-- harkens back to a powerful tradition that helped to bring about great change in this country. But I also want to make sure that they understand that being a good citizen being an activist involves hearing the other side--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: See, that's what I wanted to ask you (CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: --and making sure that you are engaging in a dialogue, because that's also how change happens. The civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience, because people were willing to get to go to jail, because there were events like Bloody Sunday. But it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views even views that were appalling to them of the other side.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Because there does seem to be a strain on some of these campuses of a kind of militant political correctness where you shut down the other side.\n\nOBAMA: And I disagree with that. And, it's interesting. You know, I've now got, you know, daughters who-- one is about to go to college-- the other one's-- you know, going to be on her way in a few years. And then we talk about this at the dinner table.\n\nAnd I say to them, \"Listen, if you hear somebody using a racial epithet, if you hear somebody who's anti-Semitic, if you see an injustice, I want you to speak out. And I want you to be firm and clear and I want you to protect people who may not have voices themselves. I want you to be somebody who's strong and sees themselves as somebody who's looking out for the vulnerable.\"\n\nBut I tell 'em-- \"I want you also to be able to listen. I don't want you to think that a display of your strength is simply shutting other people up. And that part of your ability to bring about change is going to be by engagement and understanding the viewpoints and the arguments of the other side.\" And so when I hear, for example, you know, folks on college campuses saying, \"We're not going to allow somebody to speak on our campus because we disagree with their ideas or we feel threatened by their ideas--\" you know, I think that's a recipe for dogmatism. And I think you're not going to be as effective. And so, but I want to be clear here 'cause, and it's a tough issue because, you know, there are two values that I care about.\n\nI care about civil rights and I care about kids not being discriminated against or having swastikas painted on their doors or nooses hung-- thinking it's a joke. I think it's entirely appropriate for-- any institution, including universities, to say, \"Don't walk around in black face. It offends people. Don't wear a headdress and beat your chest if Native American students have said, you know, 'This hurts us. This bothers us.\" There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut we also have these values of free speech. And it's not free speech in the abstract. The purpose of that kind of free speech is to make sure that we are forced to use argument and reason and words in making our democracy work. And you know, the you don't have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas. Just out-argue 'em, beat 'em.\n\nMake the case as to why they're wrong. Win over adherents. That's how-- that's how things work in-- in-- in a democracy. And I do worry if young people start getting trained to think that if somebody says something I don't like if somebody says something that hurts my feelings that my only recourse is to shut them up, avoid them, push them away, call on a higher power to protect me from that. You know, and yes, does that put more of a burden on minority students or gay students or Jewish students or others in a majority that may be blind to history and blind to their hurt? It may put a slightly higher burden on them.\n\nBut you're not going to make the kinds of deep changes in society-- that those students want, without taking it on, in a full and clear and courageous way. And you know, I tell you I trust Malia in an argument. If a knucklehead on a college campus starts talking about her, I guarantee you she will give as good as she gets.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you've been having some good dinner table conversations. Mr. President, thank you.\n\nOBAMA: Thank you.", "comment_3": "Full Interview Transcript: President Barack Obama https://t.co/y6uQLu1z4h", "split": "train"}

Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that's where it's really at,'' is today distinguished professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. And he says he doesn't actually remember suggesting that rich people be killed or that people kill their parents, but ''it's been quoted so many times I'm beginning to think I did,'' he said. ''It was a joke about the distribution of wealth.''\n\nHe went underground in 1970, after his girlfriend, Diana Oughton, and two other people were killed when bombs they were making exploded in a Greenwich Village town house. With him in the Weather Underground was Bernardine Dohrn, who was put on the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted List. J. Edgar Hoover called her ''the most dangerous woman in America'' and ''la Pasionara of the Lunatic Left.'' Mr. Ayers and Ms. Dohrn later married.\n\nIn his book Mr. Ayers describes the Weathermen descending into a ''whirlpool of violence.''\n\n''Everything was absolutely ideal on the day I bombed the Pentagon,'' he writes. But then comes a disclaimer: ''Even though I didn't actually bomb the Pentagon -- we bombed it, in the sense that Weathermen organized it and claimed it.'' He goes on to provide details about the manufacture of the bomb and how a woman he calls Anna placed the bomb in a restroom. No one was killed or injured, though damage was extensive.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1974 the Weathermen took responsibility for 12 bombings, Mr. Ayers writes, and also helped spring Timothy Leary (sentenced on marijuana charges) from jail.\n\nToday, Mr. Ayers and Ms. Dohrn, 59, who is director of the Legal Clinic's Children and Family Justice Center of Northwestern University, seem like typical baby boomers, caring for aging parents, suffering the empty-nest syndrome. Their son, Malik, 21, is at the University of California, San Diego; Zayd, 24, teaches at Boston University. They have also brought up Chesa Boudin, 21, the son of David Gilbert and Kathy Boudin, who are serving prison terms for a 1981 robbery of a Brinks truck in Rockland County, N.Y., that left four people dead. Last month, Ms. Boudin's application for parole was rejected.\n\nSo, would Mr. Ayers do it all again, he is asked? ''I don't want to discount the possibility,'' he said.\n\n''I don't think you can understand a single thing we did without understanding the violence of the Vietnam War,'' he said, and the fact that ''the enduring scar of racism was fully in flower.'' Mr. Ayers pointed to Bob Kerrey, former Democratic Senator from Nebraska, who has admitted leading a raid in 1969 in which Vietnamese women and children were killed. ''He committed an act of terrorism,'' Mr. Ayers said. ''I didn't kill innocent people.''\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ayers has always been known as a ''rich kid radical.'' His father, Thomas, now 86, was chairman and chief executive officer of Commonwealth Edison of Chicago, chairman of Northwestern University and of the Chicago Symphony. When someone mentions his father's prominence, Mr. Ayers is quick to say that his father did not become wealthy until the son was a teenager. He says that he got some of his interest in social activism from his father. He notes that his father promoted racial equality in Chicago and was acceptable as a mediator to Mayor Richard Daley and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1966 when King marched in Cicero, Ill., to protest housing segregation.\n\nAll in all, Mr. Ayers had ''a golden childhood,'' he said, though he did have a love affair with explosives. On July 4, he writes, ''my brothers and I loved everything about the wild displays of noise and color, the flares, the surprising candle bombs, but we trembled mostly for the Big Ones, the loud concussions.''\n\nThe love affair seems to have continued into adulthood. Even today, he finds ''a certain eloquence to bombs, a poetry and a pattern from a safe distance,'' he writes.\n\nHe attended Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Ill., then the University of Michigan but dropped out to join Students for a Democratic Society.\n\nIn 1967 he met Ms. Dohrn in Ann Arbor, Mich. She had a law degree from the University of Chicago and was a magnetic speaker who often wore thigh-high boots and miniskirts. In 1969, after the Manson family murders in Beverly Hills, Ms. Dohrn told an S.D.S. audience: ''Dig it! Manson killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they shoved a fork into a victim's stomach.''\n\nIn Chicago recently, Ms. Dohrn said of her remarks: ''It was a joke. We were mocking violence in America. Even in my most inflamed moment I never supported a racist mass murderer.''\n\nMs. Dohrn, Mr. Ayers and others eventually broke with S.D.S. to form the more radical Weathermen, and in 1969 Ms. Dohrn was arrested and charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer during the Days of Rage protests against the trial of the Chicago Eight -- antiwar militants accused of conspiracy to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn 1970 came the town house explosion in Greenwich Village. Ms. Dohrn failed to appear in court in the Days of Rage case, and she and Mr. Ayers went underground, though there were no charges against Mr. Ayers. Later that spring the couple were indicted along with others in Federal Court for crossing state lines to incite a riot during the Days of Rage, and following that for ''conspiracy to bomb police stations and government buildings.'' Those charges were dropped in 1974 because of prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal surveillance.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nDuring his fugitive years, Mr. Ayers said, he lived in 15 states, taking names of dead babies in cemeteries who were born in the same year as he. He describes the typical safe house: there were usually books by Malcolm X and Ho Chi Minh, and Che Guevara's picture in the bedroom; fermented Vietnamese fish sauce in the refrigerator, and live sourdough starter donated by a Native American that was reputed to have passed from hand to hand over a century.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also writes about the Weathermen's sexual experimentation as they tried to ''smash monogamy.'' The Weathermen were ''an army of lovers,'' he says, and describes having had different sexual partners, including his best male friend.\n\n''Fugitive Days'' does have moments of self-mockery, for instance when Mr. Ayers describes watching ''Underground,'' Emile De Antonio's 1976 documentary about the Weathermen. He was ''embarrassed by the arrogance, the solipsism, the absolute certainty that we and we alone knew the way,'' he writes. ''The rigidity and the narcissism.''\n\nIn the mid-1970's the Weathermen began quarreling. One faction, including Ms. Boudin, wanted to join the Black Liberation Army. Others, including Ms. Dohrn and Mr. Ayers, favored surrendering. Ms. Boudin and Ms. Dohrn had had an intense friendship but broke apart. Mr. Ayers and Ms. Dohrn were purged from the group.\n\nMs. Dohrn and Mr. Ayers had a son, Zayd, in 1977. After the birth of Malik, in 1980, they decided to surface. Ms. Dohrn pleaded guilty to the original Days of Rage charge, received three years probation and was fined $1,500. The Federal charges against Mr. Ayers and Ms. Dohrn had already been dropped.\n\nMr. Ayers and Ms. Dohrn tried to persuade Ms. Boudin to surrender because she was pregnant. But she refused, and went on to participate in the Brink's robbery. When she was arrested, Ms. Dohrn and Mr. Ayers volunteered to care for Chesa, then 14 months old, and became his legal guardians.\n\nA few months later Ms. Dohrn was called to testify about the robbery. Ms. Dohrn had not seen Ms. Boudin for a year, she said, and knew nothing of it. Ms. Dohrn was asked to give a handwriting sample, and refused, she said, because the F.B.I. already had one in its possession. ''I felt grand juries were illegal and coercive,'' she said. For refusing to testify, she was jailed for seven months, and she and Mr. Ayers married during a furlough.\n\nOnce again, Chesa was without a mother. ''It was one of the hardest things I did,'' said Ms. Dohrn of going to jail.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Ayers called Chesa ''a very damaged kid.'' ''He had real serious emotional problems,'' he said. But after extensive therapy, ''became a brilliant and wonderful human being.'' .\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the couple surfaced, Ms. Dohrn tried to practice law, taking the bar exam in New York. But she was turned down by the Bar Association's character committee because of her political activities.\n\nMs. Dohrn said she was aware of the contradictions between her radical past and the comforts of her present existence. ''This is where we raised our kids and are taking care of our aging parents,'' she said. ''We could live much more simply, and well we might.''\n\nAnd as for settling into marriage after efforts to smash monogamy, Ms. Dohrn said, ''You're always trying to balance your understanding of who you are and what you need, and your longing and imaginings of freedom.''\n\n''Happily for me, Billy keeps me laughing, he keeps me growing,'' she said.\n\nMr. Ayers said he had some of the same conflicts about marriage. ''We have to learn how to be committed,'' he said, ''and hold out the possibility of endless reinventions.''\n\nAs Mr. Ayers mellows into middle age, he finds himself thinking about truth and reconciliation, he said. He would like to see a Truth and Reconciliation Commission about Vietnam, he said, like South Africa's. He can imagine Mr. Kerrey and Ms. Boudin taking part.\n\nAnd if there were another Vietnam, he is asked, would he participate again in the Weathermen bombings?\n\nBy way of an answer, Mr. Ayers quoted from ''The Cure at Troy,'' Seamus Heaney's retelling of Sophocles' ''Philoctetes:'' '' 'Human beings suffer,/ They torture one another./ They get hurt and get hard.' ''\n\nHe continued to recite:\n\nHistory says, Don't hope\n\nOn this side of the grave.\n\nBut then, once in a lifetime\n\nThe longed-for tidal wave\n\nOf justice can rise up\n\nAnd hope and history rhyme.\n\nThinking back on his life , Mr. Ayers said, ''I was a child of privilege and I woke up to a world on fire. And hope and history rhymed.''", "comment_3": "No Regrets for a Love Of Explosives; In a Memoir of Sorts, a War Protester Talks of Life With the Weathermen http://t.co/mvZ4OMGNMy #scumbag", "split": "train"}

He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.\n\nIn a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.\n\n\u201cSpecial interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cHe\u2019s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth\u2019s airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough\u2014our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nGrimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left\u2019s apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court\u2019s dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,\u201d says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. \u201cShe understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.\u201d\n\nThe Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \u201cstop special interest billionaires,\u201d that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nIn the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.\n\nAccording to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year\u2019s races.\n\nDemocrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky\u2019s Senate race.\n\nMcConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he\u2019s raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell\u2019s approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.\n\nFormer FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven\u2019t always worked out for candidates.\n\n\u201cOne reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it\u2019s not that effective in directly advancing a candidate\u2019s interest,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let\u2019s say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We\u2019ve seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.\u201d\n\nGrimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell\u2019s money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.\n\nThe McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.\n\n\u201cLike Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,\u201d McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. \u201cThe sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\u201d\n\nThe top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.\n\nAsked about Grimes\u2019 wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.\n\n\u201cThe real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.\u201d", "comment_3": "Mitch McConnell, Alison Lundergan Grimes Have 'Sharp Differences' on Campaign Finance Rules http://t.co/RYUfisqqr7 via @wfplnews", "split": "train"}

H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBO\u2019s March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA.\n\nFor various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed.\n\nWhat Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget?\n\nAssuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013\u20132022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.\n\nWhat Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits?\n\nDeficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions:\n\nThe ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansions\u2014which include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employers\u2014will be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 2013\u20132022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion.\n\nThe ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion.\n\nThe ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013\u20132022 period.\n\nWhat Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending?\n\nIn addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBO\u2019s estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations.\n\nWhy Are These Estimates Uncertain?\n\nProjections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nation\u2019s health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO and JCT, in consultation with outside experts, have devoted a great deal of care and effort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes.", "comment_3": "Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act: CBO and t... http://t.co/7if7KTus", "split": "train"}

EDT\n\nMR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nIn our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.\n\nWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n\nAnd that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.\n\nExpanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with \u201cA\u201d ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It\u2018s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\nWe'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.\n\nWe take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.\n\nOn behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Connecticut\u2019s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They\u2019ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.\n\nWe will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.\n\nWe leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.\n\nThank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who\u2019s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers \u2013- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.\n\nFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders \u2013- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We\u2019re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it\u2019s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.\n\nA majority of senators voted \u201cyes\u201d to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m going to speak plainly and honestly about what\u2019s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -\u2013 both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with \u201cA\u201d grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.\n\nTheir legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she\u2019s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.\n\nIn fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn\u2019t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That\u2019s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.\n\nBut instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of \u201cbig brother\u201d gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they\u2019re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.\n\nBut the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn\u2019t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn\u2019t prevent all future massacres. And that\u2019s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.\n\nAnd this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.\n\nI've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn\u2019t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?\n\nI've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \"A prop,\" somebody called them. \u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don\u2019t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?\n\nSo all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.\n\nBut this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don\u2019t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We\u2019re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We\u2019re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We\u2019re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.\n\nBut we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.\n\nTo all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don\u2019t act this time, you will remember come election time.\n\nTo the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn\u2019t represent your views on this one.\n\nThe point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They\u2019ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n\nSo to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you\u2019ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they\u2019ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.\n\nAnd I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We\u2019re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.\n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming that the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who\u2019ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I\u2019m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I\u2019m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND 5:55 P.M.

And I\u2019m so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.\n\n\n\nIt is an honor to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd I am honored to represent our first state\u2014my state\u2014Delaware.\n\n\n\nSince I\u2019ve never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nLet me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: \u201cThe vice president\u2019s office is on the phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: \u201cChamp, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\u201d\n\n\n\nI wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children\u2014all the children who flocked to our house\u2014that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.\n\n\n\nFailure at some point in everyone\u2019s life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn\u2019t get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.\n\n\n\nAfter the accident, she told me, \u201cJoey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.\u201d And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.\n\n\n\nMy mother\u2019s creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone\u2019s equal, and everyone is equal to you.\n\n\n\nMy parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.\n\n\n\nThat was America\u2019s promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.\n\n\n\nBut today that American dream feels as if it\u2019s slowly slipping away. I don\u2019t need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they\u2019re talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.\n\n\n\nLike millions of Americans, they\u2019re asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:\n\n\n\n* Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?\n\n* Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?\n\n* Winter\u2019s coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?\n\n* Another year and no raise?\n\n* Did you hear the company may be cutting our health care?\n\n* Now, we owe more on the house than it\u2019s worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?\n\n* How are we gonna be able to retire?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the America that George Bush has left us, and that\u2019s the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.\n\n\n\nThat promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now it\u2019s in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn\u2019t get it.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.\n\n\n\nYou know, I believe the measure of a man isn\u2019t just the road he\u2019s traveled; it\u2019s the choices he\u2019s made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that\u2019s not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.\n\n\n\nAnd he made their lives the work of his life. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That\u2019s how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It\u2019s dignity. It\u2019s respect. It\u2019s about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we\u2019re going to be ok.\n\n\n\nBecause Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.\n\n\n\nAnd when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.\n\n\n\nYou can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.\n\n\n\nI watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We don\u2019t have to accept a situation we cannot bear.\n\n\n\nWe have the power to change it. That\u2019s Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what he will do for this country. He\u2019ll change it.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain is my friend. We\u2019ve known each other for three decades. We\u2019ve traveled the world together. It\u2019s a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.\n\n\n\nBut I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,\n\n\n\nJohn thinks that during the Bush years \u201cwe\u2019ve made great progress economically.\u201d I think it\u2019s been abysmal.\n\n\n\nAnd in the Senate, John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate America, $1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for 100 million American families, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nEven today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history\u2014a half trillion dollars in the last five years\u2014he wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, biofuels. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nMillions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nHe voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nAnd when he says he will continue to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $80 billion, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nThe choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver change\u2014the change everybody knows we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. He\u2019ll cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people who draw a paycheck. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. He\u2019ll invest in the next generation of teachers. He\u2019ll make college more affordable. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will bring down health care costs by $2,500 for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the \u201csecurity\u201d back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nAs we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, we\u2019ve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia\u2019s challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we\u2019ll help the people of Georgia rebuild.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration\u2019s policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.\n\n\n\nNow, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn\u2019t ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he said only three years ago, \u201cAfghanistan\u2014we don\u2019t read about it anymore because it\u2019s succeeded\u201d? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?\n\n\n\nThe fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban\u2014the people who actually attacked us on 9/11\u2014have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack\u2019s call for more troops.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.\n\n\n\nNow, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that\u2019s the best way to advance our security.\n\n\n\nAgain, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq\u2014that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?\n\n\n\nNow, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.\n\n\n\nFolks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they\u2019ll look to us again, they\u2019ll trust us again, and we\u2019ll be able to lead again.\n\n\n\nJill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young children\u2014and when I look at my grandchildren\u2014I realize why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here for their future.\n\n\n\nAnd I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers\u2014the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.\n\n\n\nOur greatest presidents\u2014from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy\u2014they all challenged us to embrace change. Now, it\u2019s our responsibility to meet that challenge.\n\n\n\nMillions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.\n\n\n\nThese are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I\u2019m ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America\u2019s time.\n\n\n\nMay God bless America and protect our troops.", "comment_3": "What the People\u2019s Vote crew won\u2019t tell you:\n\nReferendum requires Act of Parliament.

So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.\n\nGo to the polls\n\nUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.\n\nNational polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:\n\nQuinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: \"Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?\" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nCBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: \"Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?\" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nGallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: \"Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?\" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.\n\nQuinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: \"Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?\" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.\n\nPew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose \"making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks\"? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.\n\nPew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.\n\nSo are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham\u2019s producers and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.\n\nFor example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.\n\nSome gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.\n\nThis highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.\n\nThe same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.\n\n\"People don't seem to like the idea of \u2018gun control,\u2019 but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,\" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIngraham said, \"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.\"\n\nNumerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.\n\nWhile there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings \u2014 such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.\n\nWe rate Ingraham\u2019s claim False.", "comment_3": "@DanMule24 @FoxNews Laura Ingraham wrongly says claim that 90% support for gun background checks has been debunked - Politifact", "split": "train"}

Mr. Gibbs said they would put in place a \u201cstricter regulatory structure\u201d to prevent breakdowns in food-safety inspections.\n\nPart of the review is sure to examine whether the requirement for the peanut company\u2019s approval caused delays in warnings about its products once public health officials became aware of significant problems at its plant in Blakely, Ga. The warning also covered products from the company\u2019s customers that manufacture food, including Kellogg.\n\nA representative for the peanut company would not comment. Kris Charles, a Kellogg spokeswoman, said \u201cKellogg acted quickly and recalled potentially impacted products within hours\u201d of the peanut company\u2019s second recall announcement.\n\nJudy Leon, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, refused to comment.\n\nMore than 500 people have been sick in the outbreak of salmonella poisoning, and 8 have died. More than 430 product brands have been recalled.\n\nThe delays meant Sarah Kirchner of Belle Plaine, Minn., whose two young children became ill from the outbreak, for weeks had no idea how to prevent a recurrence. Her 3-year-old son, Michael, was hospitalized for four days with intense pain in his head, neck and shoulders, she said.\n\n\u201cHe had a spinal tap, bone scan, M.R.I. and a CT scan,\u201d Ms. Kirchner said. \u201cI\u2019m still so worried about him.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d said Ms. DeLauro, who promised to offer legislation on Wednesday that would split the agency\u2019s food oversight into a separate entity with mandatory recall authority and other powers.\n\nPublic health officials pinpointed the Blakely plant as the source of the salmonella outbreak on Jan. 9. The peanut company announced a limited recall on Jan. 13 and expanded it on Jan. 16. The company waited until Jan. 28 before recalling all products made at the plant in 2007 and 2008, even though it had known since 2007 that tests of products showed contamination with salmonella.\n\nFood buyers and some top public health officials say they knew before any public announcement that the company\u2019s products and those of its customers were the likeliest source of the outbreak.\n\nCraig Wilson, an assistant vice president at Costco, said he pulled Kellogg\u2019s Keebler and Austin peanut butter crackers off shelves a day before Kellogg\u2019s first announcement and nearly a week before the Peanut company and Kellogg issued a nationwide recall that covered those cookies.\n\nMr. Wilson said he could not wait for the F.D.A. to make announcements about food problems that are widely known among food safety officials.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that you can\u2019t rely on the F.D.A.,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, \u201cbut we certainly can move quicker than they do.\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. can seize a product that it suspects is contaminated, and it can ask a federal judge for authority to recall products if a maker refuses to do so. The agency can also announce that it suspects problems with a product before the company agrees to a recall. But it rarely does any of these.\n\nBill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Seattle, said the agency had neither the authority nor the courage it needed to keep the food supply safe.\n\nMichael R. Taylor, a former top official at the food agency, said change was needed.\n\n\u201cF.D.A. negotiates communications about recalls with companies,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, \u201cand that sometimes leads to delays.

President John Doe (10/19/07, 5:30 pm)\n\nPresident John H. Cox? President Dal Lamagna? These names might not sound familiar, but these guys have also reported raising money for a presidential bid this cycle\u2014and in some cases have actually collected more than (slightly) better-known candidates. Cox, a Republican described as a \"Reagan fiscal and social conservative\" on his website, has raised $586,080 this year, which is more than Alan Keyes has raised, and Cox has more cash on hand than the newcomer. Lamagna, a \"progressive activist\" who has produced three documentaries about the Iraq war, has raised $376,400, which is more than Mike Gravel raised. Both Cox and Lamagna, however, have accrued pretty significant debt. Cox is in the hole $1.1 million, almost twice more than he's brought in, and Lamagna's debt is $349,000. But because they are both funding their own campaigns, they owe the money to themselves. Other lesser-known candidates are libertarians or members of other third parties. Military Continues to Give to Paul, Obama (10/19/07, 5:30 pm)\n\nDespite his anti-war stance, or perhaps because of it, Ron Paul continues to collect more money from members of the U.S. military than any other presidential candidate, including John McCain, a Vietnam War prisoner who backs the administration's policy in Iraq. Paul brought in at least $53,670 from the uniformed services, compared to McCain's $40,000. Democrat Barack Obama, who opposed the resolution to go to Iraq from the start, is the number-two recipient with at least $45,200. This trend may exemplify growing dissatisfaction among members of the military with the administration's handling of foreign policy, especially in Iraq. Democrats have received 35 percent of the total $319,000 in contributions from uniformed service members this year. By comparison, in 2000, the last presidential race before the Iraq war began, Democrats received only 18 percent of contributions from the military. *Read a Capital Eye story from September about military giving: The Other Iraq Surge Battle of the Sexes (10/19/07, 12:45 pm)\n\nHillary Clinton, the only woman running for president, is bringing in more money from female donors than any other candidate. But she doesn't have the largest number of female donors. That distinction belongs to Democrat Barack Obama, who has so far collected money from at least 22,045 women giving more than $200, compared to Clinton's 17,539. (Only donors who give more than $200 are itemized in campaign finance reports, so it's impossible to determine a gender breakdown for smaller donors.) Clinton is nearly tied with Democrat Dennis Kucinich in the percentage of total funds coming from women\u2014about 44 percent for both of them. Among Republicans, a larger number of women have given to Mitt Romney than any other candidate in the party, 8,801 donors giving a total of $12.1 million, or about 32 percent of his total. But with about 35 percent of his funds from women, dropout Sam Brownback's receipts from females make up the largest percentage of his total compared to all other GOP candidates. Hedge Funds and Private Equity Invest in Giuliani, Democrats (10/19/07, 11:15 am)\n\nAs senators, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are debating legislation that would significantly increase taxes on hedge funds and private equity firms. As presidential hopefuls, the two are raking in money from the industry, while Mitt Romney, who made his fortune in private equity, is seeing a decline in contributions from them. Nearly 61 percent of the $5.7 million in donations from hedge funds and private equity firms went to Democrats during the third quarter. Although Romney brought in $597,800 during the 1st Quarter\u2014more than any other candidate from either party\u2014he is down to $76,350 for the 3rd Quarter and $944,275 for the year. Clinton has collected $966,300 and Obama has collected $940,000 in the last nine months. The real winner of hedge fund and private equity money seems to be Republican Rudy Giuliani. He has amassed $1.1 million from the wealthy industry so far.

I've learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.\n\nAnd that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nShe has made history not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.\n\nI congratulate her on her victory in South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Children's Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.\n\nOur party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are independents and Republicans who understand this election isn't just about a change of party in Washington, but also about the need to change Washington.\n\nThere are young people, and African-Americans, and Hispanic- Americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAll of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard. You didn't do that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou didn't do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe owe our children a better future. We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.\n\nIn just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. (APPLAUSE)\n\nI honor, we honor the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy differences with him -- my differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.\n\nIt's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.\n\nIt's not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.\n\nIt's not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the American people any safer.\n\nSo I'll say this: There are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new, but \"change\" is not one of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\"Change\" is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must.\n\nIt's time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. It's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaida's leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. That's what change is.\n\nChange, Minnesota, is realizing that meeting today's threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough, direct diplomacy, where the president of the United States isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. That's what the American people demand. That's what change is.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nChange is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. It's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJohn McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill, he'd understand she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy.\n\nShe needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it. That's the change we need, Minnesota. (APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.\n\nThat man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. That's the change we need, Minnesota.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American.\n\nThat's the change we need in America. That's why I'm running for president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, the other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing. That is a debate I look forward to.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt is a debate that the American people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children.\n\nBut what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear, and innuendo, and division. What you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat you won't see from this campaign or this party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans, but we are Americans first. We are always Americans first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDespite what the good senator from Arizona may have said tonight, I've seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and I've brought many together myself.\n\nI've walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black, white, and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools.\n\nI've sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row.\n\nI've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIn our country, I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again.\n\nSo it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union.\n\nSo it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity.\n\nSo it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedom's cause.\n\nSo it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better and kinder and more just.\n\nAnd so it must be for us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica, this is our moment. This is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past...\n\n(APPLAUSE) ... our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love.\n\nThe journey will be difficult. The road will be long. I face this challenge -- I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.\n\nThank you, Minnesota.

Just the facts, all in one place.\n\nWhy did Clinton use her own email account?\n\nWhen Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.\n\nThat is the only reason she used her own account.\n\nHer usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.\n\nAs Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.\n\nWas it allowed?\n\nYes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.\n\nThe 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that \"[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.\n\nAs she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their \".gov\" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department\u2019s email system before she provided them with paper copies.\n\nA Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: \"In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.\"\n\nClinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?\n\nClinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.\n\nWhen information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nAfter reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.\n\nClinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.\n\nHow did Clinton receive and consume classified information?\n\nThe Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.\n\nA separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.\n\nIs Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email use?\n\nNo. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton\u2019s email account.\n\nIs it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?\n\nAgain, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nClinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.\n\nWhen the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.\n\nWould this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?\n\nEven if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.\n\nWhile the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.\n\nHave Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?\n\nWe understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.\n\nClinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.\n\nPress reports say she used multiple devices \u2013 a Blackberry and an iPad \u2013 is that true?\n\nClinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.\n\nWas she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-\".gov\" email account?\n\nThe State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their \".gov\" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.\n\nWhat did Clinton provide to the State Department?\n\nOn December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by \"state.gov\" accounts.\n\nEarly in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.\n\nWhy did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?\n\nIn fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.\n\nAt the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.\n\nWhy didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?\n\nIn 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.\n\nClinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department\u2019s email system.\n\nIn providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related\u2014including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting\u2014erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were \"personal\" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).\n\nAfter providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.\n\nWhy did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?\n\nThe State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department\u2019s requirements under the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.\n\nWhile this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.\n\nWhy did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.\n\nDid Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?\n\nNo. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emails\u2014they were not federal records or even work-related\u2014and therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoena\u2014which did not exist at the time\u2014that was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.\n\nRep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were \"purely personal in nature.\"\n\nIn March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. Gowdy\u2019s committee.\n\nRep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.\n\nAs Vox reported, \"[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. \u2026 Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server.\" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, \"Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' Clinton\u2019s campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making.\" Politifact added, \"Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.\"\n\nVox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, \"[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.\"\n\nWhy was the State Department given printed copies?\n\nThat is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that \"until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records.\" [5 FAM 443.3].\n\nWere any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?\n\nNo.\n\nHow many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?\n\nHer email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.\n\nHow and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nFollowing conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.\n\nA search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.\n\nAfter this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a \".gov\" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.\n\nTo help identify any potential non-\".gov\" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.\n\nNext, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.\n\nLastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: \"Benghazi\" and \"Libya.\"\n\nThese additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.\n\nWith respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nGiven Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 \u2013 prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.\n\nThe review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.\n\nDid Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?\n\nDuring her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.\n\nDid she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?\n\nShe provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.\n\nDo you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nClinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.\n\nAfter her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.\n\nGovernment officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.\n\nCan't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?\n\nBecause the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.\n\nSome of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officials\u2019 personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.\n\nWhere was the server for her email located?\n\nThe server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.\n\nWhat level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?\n\nThe security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.\n\nWas the server ever hacked?\n\nNo, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.\n\nWas there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as \"Guccifer\" hacked Sid Blumenthal\u2019s account?\n\nWhile this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.\n\nWas the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?\n\nYes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.\n\nFor example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.\n\nThis example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-\".gov\" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was Clinton\u2019s practice to forward it to officials at their \"state.gov\" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce Clinton\u2019s emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts.", "comment_3": "Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n https://t.co/6gLoLnbFPp", "split": "train"}

Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.\n\nJoining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.\n\nGOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.\n\nCORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, \"Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.\"\n\nSenator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?\n\nBROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there.\n\nCORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place.\n\nI think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed?\n\nGOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate?\n\nCORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening.\n\nAnd I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything.\n\nThis is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try to do, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to the floor. I think it's important that we do so.\n\nTAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?\n\nCORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that we voted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement.\n\nSo again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I know Sherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think, again, having this template done first is very, very important. It's very likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach that bipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put in place something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a while until we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block it unless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?\n\nBROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker was part of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. But I also--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for the federal government to come in, and if there is a failing financial system, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown, go on.\n\nBROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'll answer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Street people have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance they can kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been -- two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, Senator Dodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together, including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others and Senator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed was part of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time.\n\nI hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're asking tomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three to simply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I and others can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that they will not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more Bob Corkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very open with negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- Minority Leader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Street lobbyists.\n\nBut put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have this resolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker and Senator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do more to prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and my amendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering next week or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits on the size of these banks.\n\nLet me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago, the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too -- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.\n\nTAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce an amendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to finance operations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventing these banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behind that?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open to negotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They're complicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms where you could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives you two different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, they were just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side.\n\nLook, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the size angle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking at the derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blow up the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600 trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, that are in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you look at the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about the legislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They are important. I do know that the president has laid out what this bill does, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountable the people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, they fail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going to have the strongest consumer protections ever in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we're going to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. But Senator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the American people have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feel that after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer, they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the board members drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses in the Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's no accountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that provides any personal accountability for these CEOs?\n\nCORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something Senator Brown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact is that Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. And the reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I think he wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. I mean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'm my own person and I want to get a good bill here.\n\nBut back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and I think that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolution authority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go through this resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, I think that everything that the executive team and the board members have earned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawed back. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to the management that have caused the country to have to go through this orderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering an amendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawing back all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if it has to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate, and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't make it into the base bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawback provision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, look, in the bill now -- the president went to Cooper Union this last week to revisit the spot where more than two years ago, he went and said we need to have fundamental reform--\n\nTAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill?\n\nGOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. If you get to that point, all the management is fired--\n\nTAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons.\n\nGOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as I say, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details of how we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- and Senator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if the negotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic and we're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep this going so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going to happen. This is going to pass.\n\nCORKER: Well, let me--\n\nTAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject if I could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the big debates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong the derivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets that big money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise or fall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk.\n\nSenator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision, Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank and you have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivatives traders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have any connection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democrats are going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not?\n\nBROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back to really your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clients and serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it's consumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer Protection Agency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it's too-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating out proprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Any of those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and I think that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in the Agriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republican supporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are as open-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Monday night.\n\nAnd again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday vote is going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going to shut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, to me, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then Bob Corker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in terms of in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives that brought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means too big. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see what happens, and then we vote on a bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision to separate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insured deposits?\n\nGOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives is totally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America had even heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their, you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there are now $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that we know virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just a party that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entire financial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed that we are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under the regulatory umbrella.\n\nNow, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd and Lincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged a bunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into the bills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes in that let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten the whole system.\n\nWe can work on the -- so the--\n\nTAPPER: But you guys--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, there are several very technical aspects of difference between the Lincoln bill and the Dodd bill--\n\nTAPPER: It's not really actually that technical, whether or not--\n\nGOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that.\n\nTAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to do this. Senator Corker, I hear you giggling--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little too far, right? Senator Corker?\n\nCORKER: Are you talking to--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker.\n\nCORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan is saying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this, I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. I absolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force those things that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm on the side of let's get as much as possible.\n\nThe fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is that all of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companies hedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if we start drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what we really do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don't think separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much as possible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they have to put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up in the kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers our ability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absolute separation.\n\nTAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a great debate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, Senator Brown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.\n\nAs our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how Saturday Night Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reform to Wall Street executives.\n\nTAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugman of the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at Fox Business News. Thank you all for joining us.\n\nGeorge, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail?\n\nWILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort of sympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it's too big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale, it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what people are arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk to the entire system.\n\nThis is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there's controversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill does but not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argument about whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do.\n\nBoth sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds of failed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholder equity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be most beastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not this happens.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be a bipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that the negotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith in that.\n\nTUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. We saw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was given months to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day there wasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So, you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let's start over with this financial reform bill. That was the very same tactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery of this idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyists time to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives the Republicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. So I think Chris Dodd is very leery.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaign contributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Center for Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and in this cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are giving much more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51 million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to Wall Street?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question that in the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in the administration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed that these were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at this point, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lot more contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising.\n\nLet me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to be bipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reform with possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history of politics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks is actually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils down to saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolish the fire department. Because then people will know that they can't let their buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible.\n\nSo anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisan doesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree with George, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not the problem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of the Bank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-based institution that was the 28th largest financial institution in the United States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down.\n\nBut what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have graceful failure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with small banks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge of failing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don't have a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadow banking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would give you that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicated financial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones, and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with the fail bit.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actually have worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, at Morgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do you think the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln is trying to do, do you think that goes too far?\n\nGLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at the derivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a central clearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We have not been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction.\n\nI do believe that it's going too far to say that large financial institutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don't want to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to go out on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade in derivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too big to fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done a phenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has lost a dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in a very, very smart and effective way. The question here on resolution authority is what--\n\nTAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this -- the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financial institution that's failing. Go.\n\nGLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those other institutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It's the GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals of the world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may be in the manufacturing business or in other business?\n\nWILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think this is a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the government deeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a public utility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, they think, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Because you have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bank financial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought under TARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, or would it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electric brought under this bill?\n\nKRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we only protect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildings with rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern banking system. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there, money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionally play the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economy the same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under the umbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this has to be done.\n\nTAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take up Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be on immigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency. He sent more troops to Iraq, wants more oil drilling, gave billions to Wall Street. Rush Limbaugh said he wanted a Republican president, he got one.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: Coming up next, more of the \"Roundtable\" and of course the \"Sunday Funnies.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBREWER: I have decided to sign Senate bill 1070 into law. Order related violence and crimes due to illegal immigration are critically important issue for the people of our state.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are angry. People feel held down.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Federal government isn't doing anything for us. The state has to do something.\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: Our border is not secure, our citizens are not safe.\n\nOBAMA: The failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Some sound from the heated debate over Arizona's new immigration law. Fodder for us here on our \"Roundtable.\" We're joined as always by George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" Paul Krugman of the \"New York Times,\" and former vice president of FOX Business News, Alexis Glick.\n\nThat's a mouth full but I got it every time. Let me start before we discuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of the most controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill 1070. \"For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall be made when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person.\"\n\n\"Reasonable suspicion\" that the person is an alien. What does that mean, George?\n\nWILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be no unreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of case law trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. So it's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. They have 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So before Washington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washington ought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty which is to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in the world with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have a magnet of a welfare state to the north.\n\nSo this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be said however. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police of Arizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. \"We must enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent or social status.\" I don't know how do you that.\n\nTAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out an executive order saying that there should be no racial order that there should be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police man and you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under this law if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're a policeman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might be an illegal immigrant?\n\nTUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actually opposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no idea what it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican has said you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Of course this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with a Spanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not be Latino. There are people in my family who look as if they could be Latino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in South Africa were required to carry documents in order to move from one part of town to another.\n\nAnd let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border, it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. A rancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this has absolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doors for harassment of citizens.\n\nTAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His name was Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him, Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in our country that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan in Pakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not just for the Krentz family but for her entire country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federal failure at the border.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically what it comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue of principle, it's just a question of resources. People have been willing to be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to do reasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be a problem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheid issues, but think about a different way.\n\nWe have these massive protests in this country about alleged authoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of -- inside the Obama/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government is encroaching too much in our lives.\n\nAnd now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people, demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of those apocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are saying hand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have to prove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knows what else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula of Brazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk, right?\n\nTAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president of Brazil.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, because you are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing.\n\nKRUGMAN: Right.\n\nTAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, \"American people are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.\"\n\nAnd now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obama talking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, we thought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this is going to be a big issue in Washington.\n\nGLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey, wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. But the bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst, if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving in Washington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it.\n\nI saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh, wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at the conference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is first before we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we're going to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to address immigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got an unemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have to address citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of the pie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get, what services they're going to be offered.\n\nThis is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to address it.\n\nWILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonans support this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, by definition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent people with a huge problem.\n\nWhat the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to do this in a professional way.\n\nTAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations in Arizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, President Obama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'm sorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even before the law was passed.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act at a federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but in addition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether or not they should block this law?\n\nTUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think the Justice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spent the weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the bill itself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civil rights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place for them to look.\n\nBut the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There will be other organizations that have already said that they are planning lawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly.\n\nLet me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thought health care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle, and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's why Speaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first.\n\nTAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has been saying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators who supported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting that they need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it, though.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issues that cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it's on the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they are worried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it is the party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party that generally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many of them divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it's not so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrat tends to be kind of torn about this.\n\nRepublicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservative wing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing, which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck of an issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties, which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agenda right now.\n\nI'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate change off this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'm ready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't do it for quite a few years to come.\n\nGLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is Senator McCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trail and has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but I thought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will this impact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to that Hispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-term elections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very telling sign that in the last hours, he decided to back it.\n\nWILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is that word comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incremental improvements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly because this is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in the country. But if we would close the border, guarantee that we were not going to have serial amnesties far into the future--\n\nGLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests.\n\nWILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find that the American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on the subject, but they do want this essential attribute of national sovereignty asserted.\n\nTUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George?\n\nWILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout.\n\nTUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult than advocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles, George.\n\nTAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We're not trying to keep the Canadians out?\n\nTUCKER: The southern border---\n\nWILL: You're profiling.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh?\n\nTUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can depend on, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. So we're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard, Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off.\n\nKRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is a lot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out at least a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. The Japanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who's not Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants.\n\nGLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was saying to you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this and I said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot of the messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they support this bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNow, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerous precedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and more states, particularly on the border there, are going to have to address this on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue.\n\nTAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly, because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week, we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going to drop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the former speaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as an independent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this his only option?\n\nWILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with other people, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Nelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about six months, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, former Senator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reform bill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popular politician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man.\n\nTAPPER: Paul, very quickly.\n\nKRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. Republican Party has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderately conservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and Charlie Crist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia?\n\nTUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He has always worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always been moderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Party in Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came to Florida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment in video where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist and the Republican Party.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about the stimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus?\n\nGLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example for Republicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't support the stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did support it. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I also think the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party. If the Republicans want to figure out how to embrace Tea Party candidates, here's an example.\n\nTAPPER: All right, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where you can also check out our fact checks.", "comment_3": "@ABC If @LindseyGrahamSC is going to study some history this week, he should also carefully consider the case of Lo\u2026 https://t.co/wUhRIOwbGD", "split": "train"}

They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.\n\nSome wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.\n\n\u201cISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups \u2014 they don\u2019t want Trump in office,\u201d said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. \u201cThey want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.\u201d ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nSarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is \u201cscared to death of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a threat to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.\u201d\n\nSome voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump\u2019s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThe terrorists fear Trump right now. They\u2019re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201d\n\n[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]\n\nThe propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word \u201chell,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.\n\n\u201cI would hate to do it, but it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred \u2014 the absolute hatred \u2014 is coming from these areas,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nThe video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump\u2019s language aids jihadists.\n\n\u201cIf you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out \u2014 video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,\u201d Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. \u201c \u2018No Muslims coming to the United States,\u2019 other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements \u2014 it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Clinton added, \u201clights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.\u201d\n\n[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]\n\nTrump responded to Clinton\u2019s assertion by calling her \u201ca liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another Hillary lie,\u201d Trump said on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d late last month. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, and everybody knows that.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.\n\nMORE READING:\n\nMuhammad Ali on Donald Trump: \u2018Muslims have to stand up\u2019 to anti-Islamic speech\n\nWhy Donald Trump\u2019s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts", "comment_3": "Donald Trump featured in new jihadist recruitment video - The Washington Post https://t.co/qdUrqfNMhi", "split": "train"}

Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.\n\nRank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 --\n\nSo even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton\u2019s statement correct.\n\nIf you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.\n\nThere were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.\n\nWe should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.\n\nThat said, we think Clinton\u2019s definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.\n\nOur ruling\n\nClinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\"\n\nAs long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton\u2019s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

The following is a rundown of some of the contrasts that Hillary highlighted in her speech today in Iowa:\n\nHillary: \u201cA couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. They\u2019ve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns.\u201d\n\nSen. Obama attacked Hillary. [Fact Hub, 12/3/07]\n\nSen. Edwards criticized Hillary for using doubletalk in the debate. \"The Democratic debate on Tuesday was a defining moment in this election. From my perspective it is important for the next president of the United States to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with Bush over the last seven years. Instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from Senator Clinton on some of the most important issues facing the American people.\" [Edwards Statement, 11/3/07]\n\nHillary: \u201cWhen it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes it\u2019s acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I don\u2019t think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. That\u2019s why my health care plan covers everyone.\u201d\n\nSen. Obama\u2019s health care plan would leave 15 million uninsured. [Fact Hub, 11/19/07]\n\nHillary: \u201cWhen it comes to social security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I don\u2019t think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Social Security, I have always stood up against privatization and as president, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep Social Security as a sacred promise to our seniors.\u201d\n\nSen. Obama refused to rule out raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for social security. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]\n\nSen. Obama conceded that his plan on raising the cap for social security could impact middle income people. Sen. Obama said, \u201cWell, when I\u2014I am going to be listening to any ideas that are presented, but I think that the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax.\u201d When pressed on how he would structure the tax increase, \u201cWell, it\u2014you know, I have not specified exactly how we would structure it. Conceivably, you might have the equivalent of a doughnut hole, although this one would be a good one, as opposed to the bad doughnut hole that Bush set up for, for prescription drugs where you have a gap between people who are of middle income and very wealthy people.\u201d [Meet the Press, 11/11/07]\n\nHillary: \u201cWhen it comes to Iran, I took a stand for aggressive diplomacy. One of my opponents made a different choice: He didn\u2019t show up for the vote. He didn\u2019t speak out during a presidential debate that night. And finally, he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed \u2013 a vote for diplomacy \u2013 was really a vote for war. Well if he really thought it was a rush to war, why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote?\u201d\n\nSen. Obama missed vote, and failed to speak out during a presidential debate. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]\n\nSen. Obama criticized Hillary for voting to give George Bush the green light for Iran. Sen. Obama wrote, \u201cEven worse, the Bush administration could use the language in Lieberman-Kyl to justify an attack on Iran as a part of the ongoing war in Iraq\u2026I strongly differ with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was the only Democratic presidential candidate to support this reckless amendment.\u201d [New Hampshire Union Leader, 10/11/07]\n\nHillary: \u201cNow, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people don\u2019t know that for legislators who don\u2019t want to take a stand, there\u2019s a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but \u2018present\u2019 \u2013 which is kind of like voting \u2018maybe.\u2019 Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted \u2018present,\u2019 instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women\u2019s right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence\u2014one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds.\u201d\n\nAs a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on seven abortion bills, including a ban on 'partial birth abortion,' two parental notification laws and three 'born alive' bills. [HB382, Passed 49-3-4, 5/13/1997; SB230, Passed, 44-7-5, 3/18/1997; HB1900, Passed 38-10-9, 5/16/2001; SB562, Passed 39-7-11, 4/6/2001; SB1093, Passed 34-6-12, 3/30/2001; SB1094, Passed 33-6-13, 3/30/2001; SB1095, Passed 34-5-13, 3/30/2001]\n\nAs a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would increase penalties for the use of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school: The bill called for the mandatory adult persecution of a minor at least 15 years of age being tried for using a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. [SB759, Passed 52-1-5, 3/25/1999]\n\nAs a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would reduce the penalty for carrying a concealed weapon from a felony to a misdemeanor. [Concurrence in House Amendments 1 and 2 to SB71, Passed 36-14-9, 5/21/1997]\n\nHillary: \u201cA president can\u2019t vote \u2018present.\u2019 A president can\u2019t pick and choose which challenges he or she will face. My opponent\u2019s campaign said that voting \u2018present\u2019 was a strategy to provide political cover. The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass. Well, instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass, we need a president who will take a stand. And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country.\u201d\n\nChicago Tribune: Sen. Obama\u2019s explanation for 'present' votes is questionable; 'few of the other Democrats who voted \u2018present\u2019 on abortion bills recall such a strategy' as Sen. Obama did. Sen. Obama \"said he worked out an arrangement with abortion-rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote \u2018present\u2019 on some bills if they feared a \u2018no\u2019 would look insensitive and endanger their re-election. But few of the other Democrats who voted \u2018present\u2019 on abortion bills recall such a strategy. And, like Obama, they weren't politically vulnerable.\" [Chicago Tribune, 05/03/07]", "comment_3": "NEWS AP FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's bogus birtherism claim about Hillary Clinton: DES MOINES, Iowa... https://t.co/yxGxSxbPXW #trump #usa", "split": "train"}

See the difference at https://t.co/0CmXNAPl0a....", "target": "real", "comment_1": "i\u00b4m going back in the future by going forward in the past | www.versus-music.de", "article": "Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: The Past Versus the Future\n\nDenver, CO | January 30, 2008\n\n\n\nThank you Caroline - for your introduction, your support, and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation. You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.\n\nLet me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.\n\nSeven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.\n\nWe will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that's a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.\n\nIt is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.\n\nThe story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.\n\nMy own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.\n\nAs candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.\n\nNow there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.\n\nLobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.\n\nDivision and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.\n\nCronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.\n\nIt's a politics that uses 9/11 to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.\n\nEach candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.\n\nI am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.\n\nWe began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.\n\nAnd we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. We've reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. That's how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We don't need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. They're part of the problem. And when I'm President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.\n\nI know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the 20th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that's it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to \u201cbe patient,\u201d and to step aside for \u201csomeone with greater experience.\u201d But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, \u201cThe world is changing. The old ways will not do\u2026It is time for a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nIt is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just won't do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.\n\nIt is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.\n\nIn the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. I've been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, I'll make sure that CEOs can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. I'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And I'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $7 an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.\n\nWe're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. I'll give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $50,000 so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the woman I met who can't get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.\n\nShe can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they can't afford it. That's why my plan cuts costs by up to $2500 for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. That's the plan that I'll pass in my first term as President.\n\nIt is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it.\n\nWhen I'm President, we'll rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they're not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $4,000 tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.\n\nIt's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.\n\nWhen I'm President, we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I didn't do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I didn't get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. That's what I'll do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.\n\nAnd it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.\n\nI will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.\n\nWe need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that's exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you'll be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.\n\nI opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in 2002: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.\n\nI will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that's what I'll do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people \u201cin the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.\u201d\n\nIt's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, \u201cYou matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\u201d\n\nThis is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.\n\nWe've been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change isn't possible. That we're peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.\n\nAnd we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans won't cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor don't vote. The assumption that African-Americans can't support the white candidate; whites can't support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos can't come together.\n\nBut our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.\n\nWe followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.\n\nWe're the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.\n\nWe're the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.\n\nWe're the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.\n\nAnd we're the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.\n\nThat is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.\n\nThis is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time.", "comment_3": "Isn't a fully automated restaurant a throwback to the past, versus a sign of the future? http://t.co/mzZEwkLvTZ", "split": "train"}

I've learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.\n\nAnd that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nShe has made history not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.\n\nI congratulate her on her victory in South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Children's Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.\n\nOur party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are independents and Republicans who understand this election isn't just about a change of party in Washington, but also about the need to change Washington.\n\nThere are young people, and African-Americans, and Hispanic- Americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAll of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard. You didn't do that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou didn't do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe owe our children a better future. We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.\n\nIn just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. (APPLAUSE)\n\nI honor, we honor the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy differences with him -- my differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.\n\nIt's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.\n\nIt's not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.\n\nIt's not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the American people any safer.\n\nSo I'll say this: There are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new, but \"change\" is not one of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\"Change\" is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must.\n\nIt's time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. It's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaida's leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. That's what change is.\n\nChange, Minnesota, is realizing that meeting today's threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough, direct diplomacy, where the president of the United States isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. That's what the American people demand. That's what change is.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nChange is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. It's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJohn McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill, he'd understand she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy.\n\nShe needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it. That's the change we need, Minnesota. (APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.\n\nThat man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. That's the change we need, Minnesota.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American.\n\nThat's the change we need in America. That's why I'm running for president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, the other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing. That is a debate I look forward to.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt is a debate that the American people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children.\n\nBut what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear, and innuendo, and division. What you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat you won't see from this campaign or this party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans, but we are Americans first. We are always Americans first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDespite what the good senator from Arizona may have said tonight, I've seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and I've brought many together myself.\n\nI've walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black, white, and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools.\n\nI've sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row.\n\nI've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIn our country, I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again.\n\nSo it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union.\n\nSo it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity.\n\nSo it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedom's cause.\n\nSo it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better and kinder and more just.\n\nAnd so it must be for us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica, this is our moment. This is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past...\n\n(APPLAUSE) ... our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love.\n\nThe journey will be difficult. The road will be long. I face this challenge -- I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.\n\nThank you, Minnesota.

What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It\u2019s very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I\u2019m going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, he\u2019s not a free-trader\u201d, which I am, I\u2019m absolutely a free-trader. I\u2019m for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a free-trader,\u201d at 10%. But if I say we\u2019re putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It\u2019s really sort of an amazing thing.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I\u2019m not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don\u2019t know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we\u2019re not going to lose any more. And so it\u2019s very, very unfair.\n\nTrump on Trumponomics:Nationalism plus flexibility\n\nLeader:The impulsiveness and shallowness of America\u2019s president threaten the economy as well as the rule of law\n\nBriefing 1:Donald Trump\u2019s economic strategy\n\nBriefing 2:The contradiction at the heart of Trumponomics\n\nBriefing 3:What Donald Trump means by fair trade\n\nNow at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it\u2019s gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to\u2026they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. \u201cWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, it is. Absolutely.\u201d So, so we did that and we\u2019ll start.\n\nWe have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I\u2019ve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It\u2019s called a cooling-off period, OK? But that\u2019s not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don\u2019t want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven\u2019t given me approval. And the reason they haven\u2019t is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn\u2019t go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He\u2019ll be in sometime, I guess next week?\n\nSteve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.\n\nPresident Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, \u201cCan we negotiate?\u201d I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don\u2019t know what a hundred days is going to be like. What\u2019s it going to be like? So NAFTA\u2019s a horrible one-sided deal that\u2019s cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nBig isn\u2019t a good enough word. Massive.\n\nHuge?\n\nIt\u2019s got to be. It\u2019s got to be.\n\nWhat would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nNo, it\u2019s gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.\n\nWhat would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nI was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn\u2019t like\u2026this wasn\u2019t a game I was playing. I\u2019m not playing\u2026you know, I wasn\u2019t playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I\u2019d never even thought about\u2026it\u2019s always the best when you really feel this way. But I was\u2026I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that\u2019s fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would\u2019ve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nBut Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?\n\nWe have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70\u2014almost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they\u2019ve been negotiating for 35 years. And it\u2019s been\u2026it\u2019s been terrible for the United States. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just been terrible. They\u2019ve never been able to make it.\n\nDoes that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?\n\nNot necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I\u2019m not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn\u2019t have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?\n\nNo, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that\u2019s bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, \u201cWhen do we start this negotiation?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who\u2019s our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d So it\u2019s a real deficit. Now that\u2019s a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it\u2019s up for renegotiation and we\u2019ve informed them that we\u2019ll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don\u2019t want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.\n\nSome people think this is a negotiating tactic\u2014that you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, really not a negotiation. It\u2019s really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn\u2019t? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it\u2019s very short [laughter], you know when I\u2019m with [Xi Jinping], because he\u2019s great, when I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, \u201cWe have a problem and we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201d But he wants to help us solve that problem.\n\nNow then you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, \u201cDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator\u201d. Now I have to understand something. I\u2019m dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no\u2026because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he\u2019s a great guy.\n\nNow, with that in mind, he\u2019s representing China and he wants what\u2019s best for China. But so far, you know, he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been very good. But, so they talk about why haven\u2019t you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, \u201cJinping. Please help us, let\u2019s make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we\u2019re announcing tomorrow that you\u2019re a currency manipulator, OK?\u201d They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn\u2019t call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they\u2019re actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I\u2019ve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.\n\nOne last question on trade. Do you think you\u2019ve permanently changed the Republican Party\u2019s position on trade?\n\nNo. Because there\u2019ll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it\u2019s not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn\u2019t two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn\u2019t meet that time limit they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it there\u201d, well, they shouldn\u2019t have set a time limit.\n\nOn another element of Trumponomics, immigration\u2026\n\nRight.\n\nDo you want to curb legal immigration?\n\nOh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.\n\nAnd what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?\n\nOh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they\u2019re very strong, they\u2019re very good, I like them very much. We\u2019re going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting\u2026not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.\n\nBut the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You\u2019re not looking to reduce the numbers?\n\nOh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they\u2019re going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we\u2019ve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we\u2019re up to 73, it\u2019s going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we\u2019ve\u2026you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we\u2019re going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they\u2019re great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.\n\nAnother part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax reform didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, it actually did. But, but it\u2019s called priming the pump. You know, if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he going with taxes first, that\u2019s his wheelhouse?\u201d Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they\u2019re great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.\n\nBut beyond that it\u2019s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?\n\nIt is OK, because it won\u2019t increase it for long. You may have two years where you\u2019ll\u2026you understand the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have to prime the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s very Keynesian.\n\nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\n\nPriming the pump?\n\nYeah, have you heard it?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just\u2026I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\nYeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.\n\nSo you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?\n\nSo I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can\u2019t do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I\u2019m going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one they\u2019re leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leave\u2014go back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they\u2019re building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. They\u2019re going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.\n\nNow when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we\u2019re not leaving. I don\u2019t know if you saw what\u2019s happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They\u2019re all cancelling plans because I told them, I said\u2026I get along with them great. But I said, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, you\u2019re going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have. You\u2019re going to have a 35% tax.\u201d\n\nSo I mean, I have, it has, I haven\u2019t been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that\u2019s not a tax increase, that\u2019s no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don\u2019t leave and you won\u2019t have a\u2026but we\u2019re bringing our taxes down so low that you won\u2019t even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.\n\nThe other thing, just in case we\u2026I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. I\u2019ve been using $2.5trn, the same number we\u2019ve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, we\u2019re close. We\u2019re letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It\u2019s got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We\u2019re going to make it 10%. Now it\u2019s 35%...\n\nSorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?\n\nThe repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that\u2019s too high is the bureaucracy.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can\u2019t because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many\u2026\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re going to make it simple\n\nPresident Trump: You have to do\u2026Steve, they told me you\u2019ve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don\u2019t allow you to bring it back in.\n\nCan I ask you a question about the politics of tax?\n\nIt should be like one page.\n\nThe politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?\n\nUm. Little bit.\n\nAnd to get Democratic support, they prefer\u2026\n\nDepending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we\u2019ve got to\u2026but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It\u2019s religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]\n\nMr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they\u2019re not going to\u2026nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I\u2019ll release them. Maybe I\u2019ll release them after I\u2019m finished because I\u2019m very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\n\nHope Hicks [White House director of strategic communication]: Once the audit is over.\n\nPresident Trump: I might release them after I\u2019m out of office.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Just so you know, I\u2019ve already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe we\u2019re on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.\n\nMs Hicks: And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented before\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: By the way, so as you know I\u2019m under routine audit, so they\u2019re not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, that\u2019s something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.\n\nRight, got that.\n\nI would never do it. That would be\u2026I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.\n\nWell, the Democrats say it\u2019s important.\n\nWell, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, \u201cOh but you have to do it,\u201d I said, \u201cLook where I am\u201d. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I\u2019m under routine audit.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And the president\u2019s financial disclosure has been longer than any\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.\n\nMs Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we\u2019re focused on.\n\nPresident Trump: Right.\n\nCan I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you\u2019ve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers\u2026\n\nRight, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.\n\nBut the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t believe that. Because they\u2019re losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.\n\nBut something like eliminating the estate tax.\n\nI get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions\u2026now you\u2019re going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we\u2019re not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it\u2026you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it\u2019s pretty well covered. Hard to believe.\n\nWill you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments\u2026\n\nDo you want to answer?\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re contemplating it. We\u2019re contemplating it.\n\nContemplating getting rid of it?\n\nMr Mnuchin: No, we\u2019re contemplating keeping it. That\u2019s our preference. But we\u2019ll look at everything.\n\nSo what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.\n\nNo, I would say probably\u2026I think we\u2019re contemplating is the word. And it hasn\u2019t been determined yet, but we\u2019re contemplating.\n\nContemplating\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re contemplating various\u2026I have to say, we\u2019re contemplating various things, but one of the things that\u2019s very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it\u2019s complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.\n\nAnd are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.\n\nAre you still\u2026\n\nPart of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico\u2019s a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost\u2026we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that\u2019s like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they\u2019re down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?\n\nBut would you consider\u2026\n\nYou could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it\u2019s 17 and it\u2019s really 17 and it\u2019s a double.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right\n\nWould you consider a VAT for the United States?\n\nWell the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country because we\u2019re used to an income tax, we\u2019re used to a\u2026people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they\u2019re used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it\u2019s, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a good tax.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, \u201cYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.\u201d But the VAT is\u2026I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don\u2019t get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country, I think it\u2019s too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it\u2019s very much of a hidden tax, people don\u2019t see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week\u2026many years ago, how old is that? 35?\n\nMr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.\n\nPresident Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.\n\nBut as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?\n\nWe are dealing with Congress\u2026because it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there\u2019s still a little bit further to go because we\u2019re also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they\u2019re pulling out. You have states that aren\u2019t going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, \u201cOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,\u201d there is no Obamacare, it\u2019s dead. Plus we\u2019re subsidising it and we don\u2019t have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.\n\nYou\u2019d pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn\u2019t go through you\u2019d stop those subsidies?\n\nNo, this bill only gives them one month. They don\u2019t realize that, that\u2019s another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy\u2026\n\nThe continuation of the subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually\u2026\n\nBut my question is if the bill doesn\u2019t pass\u2026\n\nIn actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress\u2026\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass would you cut the subsidies?\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass, I\u2019d be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn\u2019t pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I\u2019d have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be much less expensive. We\u2019re going to have competition, we\u2019re getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn\u2019t pass\u2026it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t want to think about that but the answer is\u2026I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.\n\nOne of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like \u201cI want everyone to be covered\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to let people die on the streets.\n\nBut some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.\n\nOK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It\u2019s a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we\u2019re putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states do\u2026because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that\u2019ll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn\u2019t, where they\u2019re not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, \u201cIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.\u201d\n\nThe state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we\u2019re putting in $8bn and you\u2019re going to have absolute coverage. You\u2019re going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You\u2019re going to have it if you\u2019re a person going in\u2026don\u2019t forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you\u2019re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you\u2019re 70, and you really need it, you\u2019re still paying the same amount and that\u2019s really insurance.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn\u2019t heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that\u2026first of all I don\u2019t want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that hasn\u2019t been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he\u2019s been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we\u2019re\u2026you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, that will even get better as it\u2019s going along, it\u2019s going to get better. But in a way you could say, that\u2019s not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as\u2026I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that\u2019s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don\u2019t get any benefit out of it. We don\u2019t have that. We\u2019re going to have much lower premiums and we\u2019re going to have much lower deductibles.\n\nBut when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to look after people\u2026\n\nThey came through.\n\nThey came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2026Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?\n\nMike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.\n\nPresident Trump: Central casting.\n\nMr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.\n\nMs Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.\n\nPresident Trump: So I know exactly the speeches you\u2019re talking about. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow people to die on the streets\u201d, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We\u2019re talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.\n\nMr Pence: Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: People are going to have\u2026they\u2019re going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we\u2019re refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.\n\nSo, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted\u2026although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn\u2019t a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.\n\nLook, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you\u2019ll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They\u2019re so anxious to start going crazy and you know it\u2019s going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they\u2019re inundated with carriers. All different plans. That\u2019s what this is going to be like. And I said to them, \u201cWhat do you think the good plans are going to look like?\u201d He said, \u201cMr President, we\u2019re going to have so many plans. We\u2019re going to have the low version, the high version\u201d, he used the word Cadillac. I won\u2019t tell you what car he used for the low version because I don\u2019t want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [Goes off the record.]\n\nMr President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?\n\nWell I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we\u2019re going to prime the pump with the taxes because we\u2019re going to take in perhaps a little bit less, but we\u2019re going to have a lot more business, we\u2019re going to have companies coming back into the country.\n\nI know a lot of companies that want to come back in but they\u2019re not going to come back in because of taxes. And we have a lot of companies that will come back into the country. They were forced out of the country because the taxes were too high. Many, many. You look at what\u2019s going on in certain countries. In fact I own a lot of property in certain countries where they were forced out.\n\nYou look at Ireland. I own great property in Ireland that I bought during their downturn. And I give the Irish a lot, a lot of credit. They never raised their taxes. You know you would have thought when they were going through that really\u2026they would\u2019ve double and tripled their taxes. They never raised it a penny. And they got through it and they are thriving now. Ireland\u2019s done an amazing job. A lot of companies have moved to Ireland and they like it.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to be getting a lot of companies moving back and we\u2019re going to get very few companies leaving the United States because we went from the highest tax rate of\u2026not only major, you know they always say major countries, just about the highest tax rate period. And then when you add all the other things. And then when you add the regulations to the tax\u2026I\u2019ve had people tell me, because I\u2019ve cut massive regulations and we\u2019ve just started, believe me. But we\u2019ve cut regulations massively.\n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me that the cutting of those regulations is more important to them than bringing it down from 35% to 15%. And if you would have told me that, if I had a guess one before I knew the answer, I would\u2019ve said, nobody would\u2019ve taken the regulations. 90% of the people would rather have the regulations cut. So when you talk about the tax cut, the regulation cut, Dodd-Frank, you\u2019ll be doing a story on that fairly soon because we\u2019re doing a very massive overhaul on Dodd-Frank. We\u2019re doing things that are going to keep people real happy.\n\nAnd then ultimately, when I leave office, on the assumption [Mike Pence] doesn\u2019t follow me, but he will. But when I leave office what happens is slowly they\u2019ll nip away at it, nip away, nip away and then in 40, 50 years somebody else will come along and bring it back. But we\u2019re bringing back entrepreneurship. We\u2019re bringing back enthusiasm. And if you look at the people that read your magazine, that are in this country, the enthusiasm levels, and you know this because you see it, are the highest they've even been. The enthusiasm levels for manufacturers went up 27 points in two months. If it goes up a quarter of point it\u2019s like a massive\u2026it went up 27% in two months, up to 93%, they\u2019ve never been even close. The enthusiasm for business is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nMs Hicks: And we\u2019ll have you guys back to talk about it.

{"comment_2": "Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights:\n2014 State Policy Review  http://t.co/5dcojpURlB", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights: 2013 State Policy Review https://t.co/00BkNaZKF2", "article": "by Elizabeth Nash, Rachel Benson Gold, Andrea Rowan, Gwendolyn Rathbun and Yana Vierboom\n\nReproductive health and rights were once again the subject of extensive debate in state capitols in 2013. Over the course of the year, 39 states enacted 141 provisions related to reproductive health and rights. Half of these new provisions, 70 in 22 states, sought to restrict access to abortion services. In sharp contrast to this barrage of abortion restrictions, a handful of states adopted measures designed to expand access to reproductive health services. Most notably, California enacted the first new state law in more than seven years designed to expand access to abortion, and five states adopted measures to expand access to comprehensive sex education, facilitate access to emergency contraception for women who have been sexually assaulted and enable patients\u2019 partners to obtain STI treatment.\n\nAbortion\n\nTwenty-two states enacted 70 abortion restrictions during 2013. This makes 2013 second only to 2011 in the number of new abortion restrictions enacted in a single year. To put recent trends in even sharper relief, 205 abortion restrictions were enacted over the past three years (2011\u20132013), but just 189 were enacted during the entire previous decade (2001\u20132010).\n\nForty-five percent of the abortion restrictions enacted over the last three years fall into four categories: targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP), limitations on insurance coverage of abortion, bans on abortions at 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period) and limitations on medication abortion. States enacted 93 measures in these four categories from 2011 through 2013, compared with 22 during the previous decade.\n\nThe number of new abortion restrictions ballooned from 43 enacted in 2012 to 70 in 2013. Four states were key to this increase. North Dakota and Texas, which did not have legislative sessions in 2012, together enacted 13 restrictions in 2013. In addition, the 2012 elections brought changes to the legislature in Arkansas and the governor\u2019s mansion in North Carolina that created environments more hostile to abortion; after adopting no abortion restrictions in 2012, these two states together enacted 13 new restrictions in 2013.\n\nThis legislative onslaught has dramatically changed the landscape for women needing abortion. In 2000, the two states that were the most restrictive in the nation, Mississippi and Utah, had five of 10 major types of abortion restrictions in effect (see Appendix). By 2013, however, 22 states had five or more restrictions, and Louisiana had 10.\n\nIn 2000, 13 states had at least four types of major abortion restrictions and so were considered hostile to abortion rights (see Troubling Trend: More States Hostile to Abortion Rights as Middle Ground Shrinks); 27 states fell into this category by 2013. In contrast, the number of states supportive of abortion rights fell from 17 to 13, while the number of middle-ground states was cut in half, from 20 to 10. The proportion of women living in restrictive states went from 31% to 56%, while the proportion living in supportive states fell from 40% to 31% over the same period.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it is particularly noteworthy that California moved to significantly improve access to early abortion services by expanding the types of providers permitted to perform either medication or surgical abortions. Legislation enacted in September allows physician assistants, certified nurse midwives and nurse practitioners to provide abortions during the first trimester. Thirty-nine states limit the provision of abortion services to licensed physicians (see Overview of Abortion Laws). Also this year, Colorado repealed its pre-Roe abortion law. Although these measures are not enforced, 12 states continue to have pre-Roe laws on the books (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).\n\nDespite this progress, the overwhelming preponderance of legislation concerning abortion was aimed at restricting access to the procedure. Four types of restrictions dominated the legislative scene during 2013: abortion bans, restrictions on abortion providers, limitations on the provision of medication abortion and restrictions on coverage of abortion in private health plans. Together, legislation in these four categories accounted for 56% of all restrictions enacted over the year.\n\nBans on Abortion\n\nOvertly flouting the standard established by Roe v. Wade, two states enacted laws banning abortion early in pregnancy. In March, the Arkansas legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Mike Beebe (D) to ban abortions occurring more than 12 weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Later that month, North Dakota enacted a ban on abortions occurring after a fetal heartbeat is detected, something that generally occurs at about six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Legal challenges were quickly filed to both measures and enforcement is blocked while litigation proceeds. Additionally, the North Dakota legislature also approved an initiative that will be placed on the November 2014 ballot to ban abortion entirely by defining a person as a \u201chuman being at any stage of development.\u201d Currently, no state has a law in effect prohibiting abortions early in pregnancy (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).\n\nAntiabortion legislators in 11 states introduced measures aimed at banning abortion later in pregnancy based on the spurious belief that a fetus can feel pain at that point of development, and three new laws were enacted in Arkansas, North Dakota and Texas. These laws ban nearly all abortions performed at or beyond 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after the woman\u2019s last menstrual period). All three have gone into effect, bringing to nine the number of states with a 20-week ban in effect (see State Policies on Later Abortions ). (A similar 20-week ban was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in June; although introduced in the Senate late in the year, the measure was not voted on.)\n\nTargeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP)\n\nEight states enacted onerous and irrelevant licensing requirements targeting abortion clinics and providers in 2013. These laws are designed to discourage medical professionals from providing abortion and make it impossible for clinics to remain open (see TRAP Laws Gain Political Traction While Abortion Clinics\u2014and the Women They Serve\u2014Pay the Price). Most often, these restrictions require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, mandate transfer agreements with hospitals or impose onerous structural requirements on clinics.\n\nFour states (Alabama, North Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin) enacted laws that require providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. These measures effectively give hospitals veto power over clinics\u2019 ability to provide services. All four were immediately challenged in court; enforcement of the Alabama, North Dakota and Wisconsin laws was temporarily blocked, but the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for implementation of the Texas requirement as the litigation proceeds. Nine states now have laws requiring abortion providers to have hospital privileges; four are in effect (see State Policies on Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers).\n\nOhio has long required abortion providers to have an agreement with a hospital allowing the transfer of patients needing emergency care. In June, the state adopted a new provision prohibiting public hospitals from entering into these transfer agreements. Including Ohio, nine states require abortion providers to have transfer agreements, measures that do little to add to existing patient safeguards in the event of an emergency.\n\nOver the course of 2013, five states implemented new structural standards for abortion providers. North Carolina and Texas enacted measures requiring abortion clinics to meet essentially the same standards required for comprehensive ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that provide more invasive and risky procedures and use higher levels of anesthesia. Alabama adopted somewhat more limited requirements relating to emergency care and fire safety. Virginia, meanwhile, finalized regulations to implement its 2011 TRAP law. Finally, Indiana, which had already required sites where surgical abortion was performed to adhere to standards similar to those for ASCs, extended these requirements to apply to sites where only medication abortion is performed. Including these new requirements, 26 states now require abortion facilities to essentially meet ASC standards.\n\nMedication Abortion\n\nSeventeen states have adopted restrictions on medication abortion over the last three years\u2014 making it one of the most frequent targets of abortion opponents (see Medication Abortion Restrictions Burden Women and Providers\u2014and Threaten U.S. Trend Toward Very Early Abortion). In 2013 alone, eight states moved to ban the use of telemedicine in administering the medication, despite the fact that telemedicine is rapidly gaining acceptance as a way to expand access to health care. Over the course of the year, seven states (Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas) enacted laws effectively banning the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. In addition, the Iowa Board of Medicine adopted regulations prohibiting the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. Over the course of the year, courts blocked enforcement of the Iowa regulations, as well as earlier laws that had been enacted in North Dakota and Wisconsin. As of December, 14 states have measures in effect blocking the use of telemedicine to provide medication abortion (see State Policies on Medication Abortion).\n\nThe second way states have moved to restrict access to medication abortion is by requiring use of an outdated protocol that mandates a high dose of the medicine (in contrast to a widely used evidence-based protocol that permits a lower dose), prohibits its use after 49 days of pregnancy and requires the woman to make an extra trip to the clinic. In 2013, Texas adopted a variation on this approach by permitting use of the lower dose but retaining the two other limitations. The state joins Ohio in requiring use of the outdated protocol.\n\nFinally, Oklahoma adopted a law in 2010 designed to ban medication abortion entirely. In 2012, the state\u2019s supreme court overturned the law and in November, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case. As a result, the ban is not in effect.\n\nPrivate Insurance Coverage of Abortion\n\nStates adopted three types of restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion. Michigan\u2019s new measure is the most expansive of those enacted in 2013, it prohibits abortion coverage in private health plans except when the woman\u2019s life is endangered. This brings to nine the number of states with restrictions that apply to all private health plans (see State Policies on Restricting Insurance Coverage of Abortion).\n\nThe Michigan provisions also specifically prohibit plans participating in the health exchange from providing coverage beyond situations when the woman\u2019s life is endangered. Three other states (Arkansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) also enacted provisions that greatly restrict abortion coverage in the health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act and only allow coverage in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest. Additional abortion coverage in Arkansas, Michigan and Pennsylvania is available only through the purchase of a separate rider at an additional cost. Including these four states, 24 states have banned abortion coverage in health exchanges.\n\nNorth Carolina enacted a measure prohibiting health plans for county or municipal employees from covering abortion except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest. The Georgia Board of Community Health approved a health plan for state employees that will not cover abortion except in cases of life endangerment. Nineteen states now limit abortion coverage for state employees.\n\nOther Major Abortion Restrictions\n\nStates adopted a wide range of other major abortion restrictions in 2013.\n\nParental Involvement. Three states enacted provisions designed to make it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without parental involvement. Arkansas enacted a measure that makes it a crime to assist a minor in obtaining an abortion without parental consent, even if the procedure is performed in a state where parental involvement is not required. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) allowed a parental consent requirement to go into effect without his signature; enforcement of the law is blocked pending a legal challenge. Oklahoma, which has long required parental consent and notification, adopted a measure that made the process for complying with the law more cumbersome by adding requirements such as documentation from parents proving parenthood. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court cleared the way for the state\u2019s 1995 parental notice law to go into effect, bringing the number of states requiring parental involvement before a minor receives an abortion to 39 (see State Policies on Parental Involvement in Minors\u2019 Abortions).\n\nPublic Funding for Abortion. Iowa continued its policy of paying for abortions only in cases of life endangerment, rape, incest and fetal impairment. However, the state now requires the governor\u2019s office to approve all instances where reimbursement is provided. Most states pay for abortion only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest; Iowa is one of six states with a slightly broader standard see State Policies on State Funding of Abortion Under Medicaid). Seventeen states pay for all or most medically necessary abortions for low-income women (see Insurance Coverage of Abortion: Beyond the Exceptions for Life Endangerment, Rape and Incest).\n\nWaiting Periods. South Dakota effectively extended its 72-hour waiting period by declaring that weekends and holidays could not be counted toward the requirement; this could extend the waiting period to a maximum of six days in some cases, giving the state the most restrictive waiting period requirement of the 26 such requirements in the country (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).\n\nCounseling. Ohio and Kansas expanded their existing counseling requirements. Ohio moved to require providers to test for a fetal heartbeat at least 24 hours before an abortion and inform the woman of the \u201cstatistical probability\u201d of carrying the pregnancy to term if a fetal heartbeat is detected. Kansas enacted a measure requiring that abortion counseling materials include information on fetal pain, the risk of breast cancer and premature birth; the measure also delineates the exact text for written counseling materials (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).\n\nUltrasound. Wisconsin and Indiana both adopted measures that require women to undergo an ultrasound prior to obtaining an abortion and listen to a detailed description of the image; the provider must offer her the option to view the image and listen to the heartbeat. Twenty-two states now regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers (see State Policies on Requirements for Ultrasound).\n\nSex Selection and Genetic Impairment. Kansas, North Carolina and North Dakota enacted provisions criminalizing abortion for the purposes of sex selection. The North Dakota measure also prohibits the provision of an abortion because the fetus has been \u201cdiagnosed with either a genetic abnormality or the potential for a genetic abnormality.\u201d This brings to six the number of states that ban abortion for purposes of sex selection, in line with a recent push by abortion opponents both in the U.S. and internationally (see A Problem-and-Solution Mismatch: Son Preference and Sex-Selective Abortion Bans).\n\nWithholding Information. Kansas and Montana enacted laws that shield medical professionals from liability for withholding information that may have resulted in a woman obtaining an abortion.\n\nState Employees. Kansas enacted a measure prohibiting state employees from participating in or facilitating abortions unless the procedure is performed outside of normal working hours at a facility not funded or operated by the state.\n\nRefusal. A new law adopted in North Carolina allows any health care facility to refuse to provide abortion services; the previous law had allowed only hospitals to refuse. The law also expands the types of medical providers who may refuse to participate in an abortion to include professionals such as pharmacists, counselors and social workers, or their employees; previous law had applied only to physicians and nurses (see Refusing to Provide Health Services).\n\nFamily Planning\n\nTwenty states enacted measures relating to access to family planning services in 2013, including measures that set funding levels, determine the types of providers eligible for funding and affect access to emergency contraception.\n\nFamily Planning Programs\n\nOf the 17 states that passed budgets with line items for family planning funding, only Maine cut funding drastically; following on the heels of a 25% cut in 2012, the state slashed funds by an additional 33% in 2013. In contrast, New Hampshire reversed the 57% cut to family planning funding that had been adopted in 2011, restoring funds to their previous level. A similar attempt to reverse funding cuts in New Jersey came up short when Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed family planning funding for the fifth time.\n\nAlthough family planning funding remained relatively stable in 2013, attempts to restrict family planning providers\u2019 eligibility for state and federal funds continued apace. A new tiered system for determining priority for state and federal family planning funds in Ohio puts family planning providers at the bottom of a long list. A similar system in Oklahoma excludes specialized family planning providers not affiliated with health departments from receiving funds. Colorado, Kansas, Michigan and Texas re-enacted their existing restrictions, although the measure in Kansas is blocked due to a legal challenge. At year\u2019s end 10 states have abortion-related restrictions on family planning providers (see State Family Planning Funding Restrictions).\n\nFederal courts blocked measures enacted in Arizona and Indiana that would have excluded family planning providers who have any association with abortion services from being able to participate in the massive Medicaid program, citing that Medicaid patients have the right to seek treatment from the Medicaid provider of their choice (see Besieged Family Planning Network Plays Pivotal Role).\n\nThese injunctions cleared the way for abortion providers in Arizona and Indiana to be reimbursed for the family planning services they provide to Medicaid enrollees. In sharp contrast, Texas abolished its longstanding and successful federal-state family planning expansion after being told by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services that it was impermissible for the state to exclude providers who had some association with abortion. The state replaced it with a much smaller and entirely state-funded program (see State Medicaid Family Planning Eligibility Expansions).\n\nEmergency Contraception\n\nHawaii enacted a new law requiring that a woman who has been sexually assaulted receive medically accurate and unbiased information on emergency contraception from the hospital treating her injuries. The law also requires the hospital to dispense the medication when requested by the woman. Hawaii is the 18th state to provide protections to women who have been sexually assaulted (see Emergency Contraception).\n\nHowever, two states moved to restrict access to emergency contraception. In May, Oklahoma enacted a measure that would have required a minor younger than 17 to obtain a prescription to access the medication, despite the fact that the federal Food and Drug Administration ruled that minors of any age may obtain emergency contraception without a prescription; in August, a state court temporarily blocked enforcement of the measure. Also in 2013, Missouri passed a measure prohibiting the state from requiring pharmacies to carry prescription or nonprescription drugs or devices, including contraceptives, such as emergency contraception.\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\n\nIn 2013, Hawaii, Nebraska and Vermont expanded access to treatment for STIs. Hawaii and Nebraska enacted provisions allowing health care practitioners to prescribe or dispense prescriptions for gonorrhea or chlamydia to a patient\u2019s partner without first seeing the partner. Vermont, which had had a law allowing partner treatment for some STIs, enacted a new law expanding the conditions for which partner treatment is permitted. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit treatment of a patient\u2019s partner (see Partner Treatment for STIs).\n\nSex Education\n\nTwo states enacted measures to expand access to sex education in 2013. A new law in Colorado effectively prohibits abstinence-only instruction by requiring sex education in the state to be scientifically proven to delay sexual debut, reduce adolescents\u2019 number of sexual partners, reduce the frequency of sex, and increase their contraceptive use. Illinois enacted three separate laws related to sex education. Although school districts can still decide for themselves whether to provide sex education, the new law requires any sex education that is taught in the state to be medically accurate and age-appropriate and include instruction on contraception and abstinence. The package also requires health education, which is mandatory for all school districts, to contain medically accurate information on abstinence as well as age-appropriate instruction on teen dating violence and child sexual abuse prevention. These new laws bring to nine the number of states requiring that the sex education provided in the state be medically accurate and include information on contraception (see State Policies in Brief: Sex and HIV Education.)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, new laws in North Carolina and Kansas could limit access to comprehensive and medically accurate sex education. A new law enacted in Kansas prohibits an individual who is associated in any way with an abortion provider from providing sex education. Meanwhile, a new law in North Carolina requires that sex education in the state must inform students that having an abortion increases the risk of a subsequent preterm birth. In Montana, Gov. Bullock (D) vetoed a measure that would have required parental consent for students participating in sex education.\n\nFetal Issues\n\nThree states enacted laws regarding assault on pregnant women or fetal homicide. Arkansas adopted a measure allowing a fetus to be considered a victim of homicide at any point in gestation; a similar measure was allowed to go into effect in Montana without the governor\u2019s signature. Instead of considering a fetus an independent victim, Colorado amended its statute criminalizing assault on a pregnant woman to include penalties for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry.\n\nPregnancy\n\nTennessee enacted a law requiring publicly funded substance abuse facilities to give preference to pregnant women, there are now 10 states that require facilities give pregnant women priority access (see Substance Abuse During Pregnancy). It also prohibits the state from filing for protective services for a newborn if a woman who is less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy seeks substance abuse treatment as part of prenatal care. (A similar bill in New Mexico was effectively vetoed when Gov. Susana Martinez (R) took no action on it.) Finally, the budget adopted in Indiana allocated $250,000 for \u201cprenatal substance use and prevention.\u201d\n\nAPPENDIX: STATES BY HOSTILITY TO ABORTION RIGHTS, 2000 AND 2013", "comment_3": "Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights: 2012 State Policy Review http://t.co/Wu3oibrY", "split": "train"}

EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Cincinnati! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Ohio! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, labor! (Applause.) All-righty. It is good to be back in Cincinnati. (Applause.) It's good to be back in Ohio. (Applause.) It's good to be back among great friends, great leaders. And I want everybody to give a big round of applause to Charlie Dilbert for that great introduction. (Applause.) And I want to thank Kathy Mattea and the band for the entertainment. Give Kathy a big round of applause. (Applause.)\n\nHow you all feeling today? (Applause.) Are you fired up? (Applause.) Are you ready to go? (Applause.) I can't think of a better place to be on Labor Day than at America's biggest Labor Day picnic, and with the workers and families of the Cincinnati AFL-CIO. (Applause.)\n\nI'm so proud to be on the stage with Charlie, because Charlie reminds us that in these tough times, America's working men and women are ready to roll up their sleeves and get back to work. (Applause.)\n\nI want to salute your local AFL-CIO local leaders: Executive Secretary-Treasurer Doug Sizemore -- (applause) -- President Joe Zimmer -- (applause) -- State President Joe Rugola. And your outstanding national leaders: a man who we thank for devoting his life to working Americans -- President John Sweeney. (Applause.) He's right there. And the man who will pick up the mantle, who will take the baton of leadership, who we need to succeed because a strong labor movement is part of a strong economy -- is part of a strong economy -- Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka. (Applause.)\n\nAlthough Ohio's wonderful governor and great friend of mine Ted Strickland couldn't be here, we've got Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher in the house -- (applause) -- Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner -- (applause) -- Attorney General Richard Cordray -- (applause) -- Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory -- (applause) -- Hamilton County Commissioner -- Commission President David Pepper. (Applause.)\n\nWe're joined by members of Ohio's outstanding congressional delegation: Congressman Steve Driehaus -- (applause) -- and a great friend who is at the forefront of every fight for Ohio's working men and women, including the battle for health insurance reform, Senator Sherrod Brown. (Applause.)\n\nI'm also proud to be here with a leader who is reenergizing the Department of Labor, who realizes that it's not the Department of Management, it's the Department of Labor -- (applause) -- a daughter of union members, a daughter of a Teamster -- Secretary Hilda Solis. (Applause.) My director of recovery for auto communities and workers, Ed Montgomery, is in the house, and he's doing outstanding work. (Applause.)\n\nNow, Cincinnati, like a lot of Americans, you're having some fun today. Taking the day off. Spending time with the kids. Some of you may be proud of your grilling skills. (Laughter.) Every man thinks he can grill -- (laughter) -- whether he can or not. That's what Michelle says. (Laughter.) Michelle says she's a better griller than me. (Applause.) I don't know. We'll have to have a grill-off someday. But you're enjoying some good music, some good food, some famous Cincinnati chili. (Applause.)\n\nBut today we also pause. We pause to remember and to reflect and to reaffirm. We remember that the rights and benefits we enjoy today weren't simply handed to America's working men and women. They had to be won. They had to be fought for, by men and women of courage and conviction, from the factory floors of the Industrial Revolution to the shopping aisles of today's superstores. They stood up and they spoke out to demand a fair shake and an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. (Applause.)\n\nMany risked their lives. Some gave their lives. Some made it a cause of their lives -- like Senator Ted Kennedy, who we remember today. (Applause.)\n\nSo let us never forget: much of what we take for granted -- the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, health insurance, paid leave, pensions, Social Security, Medicare -- they all bear the union label. (Applause.) It was the American worker -- men and women just like you -- who returned from World War II to make our economy the envy of the world. It was labor that helped build the largest middle class in history. Even if you're not a union member, every American owes something to America's labor movement. (Applause.)\n\nSo as we remember this history, let's reflect on its meaning in our own time. Like so many Americans, you work hard. You meet your responsibilities. You play by the rules. You pay your bills. But in recent years, the American Dream seems like it's been slipping away, because from Washington to Wall Street, too often a different attitude prevailed. Wealth was valued over work, selfishness over sacrifice, greed over responsibility. The right to organize was undermined rather than strengthened. (Applause.)\n\nThat's what we saw. And it may have worked out well for those folks at the top, but it didn't work out for you and it didn't work out well for our country. That culture -- that culture and the policies that flowed from it -- undermined the middle class and helped create the greatest economic crisis of our time.\n\nSo today, on this Labor Day, we reaffirm our commitment. To rebuild. To live up to the legacy of those who came before us. To combine the enduring values that have served us so well for so long -- hard work and responsibility -- with new ideas for a new century. To ensure that our great middle class remains the backbone of our economy -- not just a vanishing ideal we celebrate at picnics once a year as summer turns to fall. We want it a reality for the families of Ohio and the families of America. (Applause.)\n\nThat's what we've been working to do ever since I took office. Now, I notice some people have already forgotten how bad it was just seven months ago. You notice that? They've got sort of selective amnesia. (Laughter.) So let's just remind them for a second. (Applause.) A financial system on the verge of collapse; about 700,000 workers losing their jobs each month; the worst recession of our lifetimes threatening to become another Great Depression.\n\nThat's what was happening just seven months ago. And that's why we took bold, swift action. That's why we passed an unprecedented Recovery Act, and we did it without the usual Washington earmarks and pork-barrel spending. And, Ohio, it is working. (Applause.)\n\nTimes -- times are still tough. Times are still tough, I know that. But we have given 95 percent of America's working families a tax cut -- 4.5 million families in Ohio, including here in Cincinnati -- a promise we made during the campaign; a promise I kept as President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nWe cut taxes for small businesses, made new loans to more than 1,000 small businesses in Ohio so they could grow and hire more workers. We extended unemployment benefits for 12 million Americans, including Charlie and nearly 570,000 Ohio citizens. (Applause.) Across America, we've saved the jobs of tens of thousands of state and local workers, including teachers and first responders right here in Ohio. Don't take my word for it. Ask folks here in Ohio what they would have done if we hadn't passed the Recovery Act -- the cuts they would have had to make, the taxes they would have had to raise.\n\nWe're rebuilding America's infrastructure, including improvements to I-75 in Hamilton County, led by a local Cincinnati contractor. (Applause.) We've got more than 200 other highway projects across Ohio, and we're making a historic commitment to innovation -- much of it still to come in the months and years ahead: doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy; building a new smart grid to carry electricity from coast to coast; laying down broadband lines and high-speed rail lines and providing the largest boost in basic research in our history -- all of which will put people back to work. (Applause.) Steelworkers, plumbers, pipe-fitters, engineers, you name it.\n\nSo our recovery plan is working.\n\nQ What about bricklayers?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Bricklayers, too. (Applause.) The financial system -- financial system has been saved from collapse. Home sales are up. We're seeing signs of life in the auto industry. Business investment is starting to stabilize. For the first time in 18 months, we're seeing growth in manufacturing. When was the last time you heard that here in the United States of America? (Applause.)\n\nNow, on Friday, we learned that the economy lost another 216,000 jobs in August. And whenever Americans are losing jobs, that's simply unacceptable. But for the second straight month, we lost fewer jobs than the month before, and it was the fewest jobs that we had lost in a year. (Applause.) So, make no mistake, we're moving in the right direction. We're on the road to recovery, Ohio. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes we can! Yes we can! Yes we can!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes we will. Yes we are.\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes we will! Yes we will! Yes we will!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But -- but, my friends, we still have got a long way to go. We're not going to rest. We're not going to let up. Not until workers looking for jobs can find them -- good jobs that sustain families and sustain dreams. Not until responsible mortgage-owners can stay in their homes. Not until we've got a full economic recovery and all Americans have their shot at the American Dream. (Applause.)\n\nNow, we can't do that if we go back to that old economy -- overleveraged banks, inflated profits, maxed-out credit cards, CEOs and bankers getting multimillion-dollar bonuses --\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- an economy of bubbles and bursts, your wages and incomes stagnant while corporate profits soar. So even as we recover from the recession and work to cut the deficit, we have to build a new foundation for prosperity:\n\nWe need an America with a reformed financial system. We got to have regulations in place that protect consumers so that we never have a crisis like this again. (Applause.) I don't want to have to bail out any more banks. (Applause.) And we got to make sure we've got regulations in place to prevent it. (Applause.)\n\nAn America where energy reform creates green jobs that can never be outsourced and that finally frees America from the grip of foreign oil. (Applause.)\n\nAn America that commits to education because the countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow and the best jobs will go to the best educated. (Applause.) So we got to do a better job educating our sons and our daughters. And, yes, I'm going to have something to say tomorrow to our children, telling them to stay in school and work hard -- because that's the right message to send. (Applause.)\n\nWe need an America that once again invests in the middle class, which is why I've created our task force for middle-class working families, led by my outstanding Vice President Joe Biden to make sure that our policies always benefit you, the American worker. (Applause.)\n\nToday we're taking another step. I'm naming Ron Bloom, who's right here -- raise your hand, Ron; he's right down in the front here. (Applause.) I'm naming Ron Bloom to lead our efforts to revitalize the sector that helped build the middle class: American manufacturing. (Applause.) Ron has worked with steelworkers, service employees, and management to create jobs. He helped guide our auto task force. And as my new point person on manufacturing, he's going to help us craft the policies that will create the next generation of great manufacturing jobs and ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century. (Applause.)\n\nOh, and by the way, just in case you were wondering, we're also going to build an America where health reform delivers more stability and security to every American. (Applause.) We are going to reform the system for those who have insurance and those who don't. Now, I'll have a lot more to say about this on Wednesday night. I might have to save my voice a little bit -- not get too excited. I don't want to give anything away. I want you all to tune in.\n\nBut let me just say a few things about this health care issue. We've been fighting for quality, affordable health care for every American for nearly a century -- since Teddy Roosevelt. Think about that -- long time. (Laughter.) The Congress and the country have now been vigorously debating the issue for many months. The debate has been good, and that's important because we've got to get this right. But every debate at some point comes to an end. At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. Ohio, it's time to act and get this thing done. (Applause.)\n\nWe have never been this close. We've never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done. And because we're so close to real reform, suddenly the special interests are doing what they always do, which is just try to scare the heck out of people.\n\nBut I've got -- I've got a question for all these folks who say, you know, we're going to pull the plug on Grandma and this is all about illegal immigrants -- you've heard all the lies. I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? (Applause.) What's your answer? (Applause.) What's your solution? (Applause.) And you know what? They don't have one. (Applause.) Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing. And we know what that future looks like: insurance companies raking in the profits while discriminating against people because of preexisting conditions; denying or dropping coverage when you get sick. It means you're never negotiating about higher wages, because all you're spending your time doing is just trying to protect the benefits that you already fought for.\n\nIt means premiums continuing to skyrocket three times faster than your wages. It means more families pushed into bankruptcy, more businesses cutting more jobs, more Americans losing health insurance -- 14,000 every day. It means more Americans dying every day just because they don't have health insurance.\n\nThat's not the future I see for America. I see reform where we bring stability and security to folks who have insurance today -- where you never again have to worry about going without coverage if you lose your job or you change your job or you get sick. You've got coverage there for you. Where there is a cap on your out-of-pocket expenses, so you don't have to worry that a serious illness will break you and your family even if you have health insurance. (Applause.) Where you never again have to worry -- where you never again have to worry that you or someone you love will be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.)\n\nI see reform where Americans and small businesses that are shut out of health insurance today will be able to purchase coverage at a price they can afford. (Applause.) Where they'll be able to shop and compare in a new health insurance exchange -- a marketplace where competition and choice will continue to hold down costs and help deliver them a better deal. And I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices will help improve quality and bring down costs. (Applause.)\n\nI see reform where we protect our senior citizens by closing the gaps in their prescription drug coverage under Medicare that costs older Americans thousands of dollars every years out of their pockets; reforms that will preserve Medicare and put it on a sounder financial footing and cut waste and fraud -- the more than $100 billion in unwarranted public subsidies to already profitable insurance companies.\n\nI want a health insurance system that works as well for the American people as it does for the insurance industry. (Applause.) They should be free to make a profit. But they also have to be fair. They also have to be accountable.\n\nThat's what we're talking about -- security and stability for folks who have health insurance, help for those they don't -- the coverage they need at a price they can afford, finally bringing costs under control. That's the reform that's needed. That's the reform we're fighting for. And that's why it's time to do what's right for America's working families and put aside partisanship, stop saying things that aren't true, come together as a nation, pass health insurance reform now -- this year. (Applause.)\n\nFew have fought harder or longer for health care in America's workers than you -- our brothers and sisters of organized labor. And just as we know that we have to adapt to all the changes and challenges of a global economy, we also know this: In good economic times and in bad, labor is not the problem. Labor is part of the solution. (Applause.)\n\nThat's why Secretary Solis made it her priority at the Labor Department to protect workers -- your safety, your benefits, your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively. (Applause.) That's why some of the first executive orders I issued overturned the previous administration's attempts to stifle organized labor. That's why I support EFCA -- to level the playing field so it's easier for employees who want a union to form a union. (Applause.) Nothing -- nothing wrong with that. Because when labor is strong, America is strong. When we all stand together, we all rise together. (Applause.)\n\nThat's why the first piece of legislation I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- (applause) -- guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) Lilly worked at a factory in Alabama. She did her job and she did it well. And then, after nearly two decades, she discovered that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work. Over the years, she had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages and in pension and Social Security benefits.\n\nLilly could have just moved on. Instead, this Alabama grandmother made a decision. She said a principle was at stake. She stood up and she spoke out for what was right -- all the way to the Supreme Court, and then Congress, and finally the White House, where she stood next to me as I signed the law that bore her name. (Applause.)\n\nOhio, that's the lesson this day -- that some things are worth fighting for. (Applause.) Equal pay. Fair wages. Dignity in the workplace. Justice on the job. An economy that works for everybody, because in America there are no second-class citizens. An economy where you can make a living and care for your families. Where you're leaving your kids something better. Where we live up to our fundamental ideals. Those words put on paper some 200 years ago -- that we're all created equal, that we all deserve a chance to pursue our happiness -- that's the calling to which we are summoned this Labor Day. That's the cause of my presidency. And that is the commitment we must fulfill to preserve the American Dream for all of America's working families.\n\nBut I'm going to need you to do it. At the beginning of this speech, I talked about whether you were fired up. (Applause.) I know that, over the last couple months, the economy has been bad, the recession has been wearing on folks -- people losing their jobs, people losing their health care, people losing their homes in some cases. It's been the usual bickering in Washington. Doesn't seem like that ever stops. Pundits on TV, they're saying how, oh, this isn't working and that's not working. You know, you start getting into a funk, and whenever I see folks in that negative place, I always think back to a story I told during the campaign. Some of you have heard it. But I just thought I'd say it again. (Applause.)\n\nIt's about where the phrase \"fired up\" comes from. So, this is when we were -- right at the beginning of the campaign for the presidency, nobody gave us a chance -- none of you all could pronounce my name. (Laughter.) And I went down to South Carolina. I went down -- I think I was -- where was I? (Laughter.) I was in Greenville -- am I right? Greenville. And the legislators were having a little banquet and they had invited me to come down to speak. And I sat next to a state representative. I had nobody supporting me back then, so I had to ask everybody. I said, will you support my campaign for the presidency of the United States? And this state rep looked me up and down and she said, \"You know, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown at Greenwood, South Carolina.\"\n\nNow, I had had a glass of wine, so I said right away, I said, okay. (Laughter.) Let's shake on it. Come to find out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everyplace else. (Laughter.)\n\nSo about a month later, I fly in -- I've been campaigning for two weeks straight, haven't seen my family, I'm exhausted, I'm tired. Get to the hotel room, I'm dragging my bag into my room, about to go to bed. I get a tap on my shoulder. It's my staff member, says, \"Excuse me, sir.\" I said, \"What?\" (Laughter.) He said, \"You have to be in the car tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. in the morning. I said, \"Why?\" (Laughter.) He said, \"Because we got to go to Greenwood like you promised.\" (Laughter.)\n\nSo the next day, I wake up and I feel worse than when I went to bed. I stagger over the window, open up the blinds -- it's pouring down rain outside; ugly day. I go out, get my newspaper, open it up, there's a bad story about me in The New York Times. I pack up my stuff, I go downstairs. My umbrella breaks and I get soaked. So that by the time I'm in the car, I'm sleepy, I'm wet, and I'm mad. (Laughter.) And we start driving, and we just keep on driving -- we're driving, we're driving, we drive -- goes on forever. Hour and a half we're driving.\n\nFinally we get to Greenwood -- although you don't know that you're in Greenwood right away. (Laughter.) It's kind of -- a lot of fields and -- (laughter.) We pull up next to a little field house in a park and I get back out and I get a little more wet and I go inside. And after this hour-and-a-half drive, lo and behold, there are only 20 people inside. (Laughter.) And most of them are wet and don't look like they really want to be there either. (Laughter.)\n\nSo, you know, I'm a professional. I go and shake everybody's hands and I've got kind of a tight smile on my face. \"How do you do? What do you do? Nice to meet you.\" Suddenly I hear this voice behind me, shouting out -- \"Fired up?\" And I'm surprised. I'm scared, almost. (Laughter.) But everybody else acts like this was normal and they all say, \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" People around me, they all say, \"Ready to go!\"\n\nI don't know what's going on. I look behind me. There is a little woman. She couldn't be more than 5'2\". Watch out -- you're little, too. (Laughter.) Little lady. She's about 50, 60 years old. She dressed like she just came from church. She got a big church hat. And she's smiling at me. She looks at me and she says, \"Fired up!\"\n\nTurns out this woman is a city council member from Greenwood who is famous for her chant. Every event she goes to, she likes chanting. She goes, \"Fired up? \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" \"Ready to go!\" And she does a little dance while she's doing it. (Laughter.)\n\nSo for the next five minutes, it seems like, she just keeps on saying this little chant. \"Fired up?\" \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" \"Ready to go!\" And I'm standing there and I'm thinking, this woman is upstaging me. (Laughter.) I don't know what to do. I'm looking at my staff. I'm thinking, when is this thing going to be over? (Laughter.)\n\nBut here's the thing, Ohio. After about a minute or two, I'm starting to feel kind of fired up. (Laughter and applause.) I'm starting to feel like I'm ready to go. (Applause.) So I start joining in the chant, and it's making me feel good. And for the rest of the day, whenever -- we campaigned the whole day. Whenever I saw my staff, I said, \"Are you fired up?\" They said, \"I'm fired up, boss. Are you ready to go?\" And I'd say, \"I'm ready to go.\"\n\nIt just goes to show you how one voice can change a room. (Applause.) And if it can change a room, it can change a city. (Applause.) And if it can change a city, it can change a state. (Applause.) And if it can change a state, it can change a nation. (Applause.) And if it can change a nation, it can change the world. (Applause.) Your voice can change the world. Your voice will get health care passed. Your voice will make sure that the American worker is protected. You can build America. I need your help.\n\nThank you, Cincinnati. Are you fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you.

He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nWhile watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. \"I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,\" Obama said. \"But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\n\nWe checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.\n\n\n\nObama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would \"strongly support\" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.\n\n\n\nWe searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the \"process moving this first year.\" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\"\n\n\n\nAlas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.\n\n\n\nOver the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework \"to fix our broken immigration system.\" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a \"a very important step.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. \"In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we\"ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,\" said Obama.\n\n\n\nObama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Unless the White House has a time machine that we don't know about, this is a Promise Broken.", "comment_3": "Ryan Murphy\u2019s Push for TV Directing Equality Making Big Strides in First\u00a0Year https://t.co/KiWJ9UG5qK https://t.co/dE0dwQ3cUd", "split": "train"}

He outlined his record, his economic plan and how he will bring change when John McCain will bring more of the same. Here are some of his remarks... Over the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\n...So let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\n...Make no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing ... we know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election. Read Barack's full remarks as prepared for delivery...\n\n\n\nRemarks of Senator Barack Obama\n\n\n\nConfronting an Economic Crisis\n\n\n\nAs Prepared For Delivery\n\n\n\nTuesday, September 16th, 2008\n\n\n\nGolden, Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong\n\n\n\nA few hours later, his campaign sent him back out to clean up his remarks, and he tried to explain himself again this morning by saying that what he meant was that American workers are strong. But we know that Senator McCain meant what he said the first time, because he has said it over and over again throughout this campaign \u2013 no fewer than 16 times, according to one independent count.\n\n\n\nNow I certainly don\u2019t fault Senator McCain for all of the problems we\u2019re facing, but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to. Because the truth is, what Senator McCain said yesterday fits with the same economic philosophy that he\u2019s had for 26 years. It\u2019s the philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down. It\u2019s the philosophy that says even common-sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise. It\u2019s a philosophy that lets Washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had this philosophy for eight years. We know the results. You feel it in your own lives. Jobs have disappeared, and peoples\u2019 life savings have been put at risk. Millions of families face foreclosure, and millions more have seen their home values plummet. The cost of everything from gas to groceries to health care has gone up, while the dream of a college education for our kids and a secure and dignified retirement for our seniors is slipping away. These are the struggles that Americans are facing. This is the pain that has now trickled up.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the difference between how Senator McCain and I would govern as President, you can start by taking a look at how we\u2019ve responded to this crisis. Because Senator McCain's approach was the same as the Bush Administration\u2019s: support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely; do nothing as the crisis hits; and then scramble as the whole thing collapses. My approach has been to try to prevent this turmoil.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2006, I introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud, risk or abuse. A year later, before the crisis hit, I warned Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke about the risks of mounting foreclosures and urged them to bring together all the stakeholders to find solutions to the subprime mortgage meltdown. Senator McCain did nothing.\n\n\n\nLast September, I stood up at NASDAQ and said it\u2019s time to realize that we are in this together \u2013 that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street \u2013 and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets. Months later, Senator McCain told a newspaper that he\u2019d love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, \u201cbut\u201d \u2013 he said \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know one.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress. Senator McCain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so-called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut, including $4 billion for the big oil companies, but no immediate help for workers.\n\n\n\nThis March, in the wake of the Bear Stearns bailout, I called for a new, 21st century regulatory framework to restore accountability, transparency, and trust in our financial markets. Just a few weeks earlier, Senator McCain made it clear where he stands: \u201cI\u2019m always for less regulation,\u201d he said, and referred to himself as \u201cfundamentally a deregulator.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is what happens when you confuse the free market with a free license to let special interests take whatever they can get, however they can get it. This is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while Wall Street is booming, and declare \u2013 as Senator McCain did earlier this year \u2013 that we\u2019ve made great progress economically under George Bush. That is how you can reach the conclusion \u2013 as late as yesterday \u2013 that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\nWell, we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy. We know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great \u2013that America is a place where you can make it if you try.\n\n\n\nAmericans have always pursued our dreams within a free market that has been the engine of our progress. It\u2019s a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world, and rewarded the innovators and risk-takers who have made America a beacon of science, and technology, and discovery. But the American economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market\u2019s invisible hand with a higher principle \u2013 that America prospers when all Americans can prosper. That is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair, and open, and honest.\n\n\n\nToo often, over the last quarter century, we have lost this sense of shared prosperity. And this has not happened by accident. It\u2019s because of decisions made in boardrooms, on trading floors and in Washington. We failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices. We let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales. The result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady, sustainable growth; a market that favors Wall Street over Main Street, but ends up hurting both.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: the American economy does not stand still, and neither should the rules that govern it. The evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform - to foster competition, lower prices, or replace outdated oversight structures. Old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices. Old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading. But instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market, too often we\u2019ve excused an ethic of greed, corner-cutting and inside dealing that threatens the long-term stability of our economic system.\n\n\n\nIt happened in the 1980s, when we loosened restrictions on Savings and Loans and appointed regulators who ignored even these weaker rules. Too many S&Ls took advantage of the lax rules set by Washington to gamble that they could make big money in speculative real estate. Confident of their clout in Washington, they made hundreds of billions in bad loans, knowing that if they lost money, the government would bail them out. And they were right. The gambles did not pay off, our economy went into recession, and the taxpayers ended up footing the bill. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nAnd it has happened again during this decade, in part because of how we deregulated the financial services sector. After we repealed outmoded rules instead of updating them, we were left overseeing 21st century innovation with 20th century regulations. When subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn, a patchwork of regulators systematically and deliberately eliminated the regulations protecting the American people and failed to raise warning flags that could have protected investors and the pensions American workers count on.\n\n\n\nThis was not the invisible hand of the market at work. These cycles of bubble and bust were symptoms of the ideology that my opponent is running to continue. John McCain has spent decades in Washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers. In fact, one of the biggest proponents of deregulation in the financial sector is Phil Gramm \u2013 the same man who helped write John McCain\u2019s economic plan; the same man who said that we\u2019re going through a \u2018mental recession\u2019; and the same man who called the United States of America a \u201cnation of whiners.\u201d So it\u2019s hard to understand how Senator McCain is going to get us out of this crisis by doing the same things with the same old players.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 this isn\u2019t 9/11. We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election.\n\n\n\nHistory shows us that there is no substitute for presidential leadership in a time of economic crisis. FDR and Harry Truman didn\u2019t put their heads in the sand, or hand accountability over to a Commission. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t put off hard choices. They led, and that\u2019s what I will do. My priority as President will be the stability of the American economy and the prosperity of the American people. And I will make sure that our response focuses on middle class Americans \u2013 not the companies that created the problem.\n\n\n\nTo get out of this crisis \u2013 and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again \u2013 we must take immediate measures to create jobs and continue to address the housing crisis; we must build a 21st century regulatory framework, and we must pursue a bold opportunity agenda that creates new jobs and grows the American economy.\n\n\n\nTo jumpstart job creation, I have proposed a $50 billion Emergency Economic Plan that would save 1 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, repairing our schools, and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts.\n\n\n\nI worked with leaders in Congress to create a new FHA Housing Security Program, which will help stabilize the housing market and allow Americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford. Going forward, we need to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as we know them with a structure that is focused on helping people buy homes \u2013 not engaging in market speculation. We can\u2019t have a situation like the old S&L scandal where its \u201cheads\u201d investors win, and \u201ctails\u201d taxpayers lose. That\u2019s going to take ending the lobbyist-driven dominance of these institutions that we\u2019ve seen for far too long in Washington.\n\n\n\nTo prevent fraud in the mortgage market, I've proposed tough penalties on fraudulent lenders, and a Home Score system that will ensure consumers fully understand mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments. To help low- and middle-income families, I will ease the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner\u2019s tax credit. This will add up to a 10 percent break off the mortgage interest rate for 10 million households. That\u2019s another $500 each year for many middle class families.\n\n\n\nUnlike Senator McCain, I will change our bankruptcy laws to make it easier for families to stay in their homes. Right now, if you\u2019re a family that owns one house, bankruptcy judges are actually barred from helping you keep a roof over your head by writing down the value of your mortgage. If you own seven homes, the judge is free to write down any or all of the debt on your second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh homes. Now that may be of comfort to Senator McCain, but that\u2019s the kind of out-of-touch Washington loophole that makes no sense. When I\u2019m President, we\u2019ll make our laws work for working people.\n\n\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen the last few days, the crisis in our financial markets now reaches well beyond the housing market. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time to do what I called for last September and again this past March \u2013 and it is only more overdue today.\n\n\n\nOur capital markets cannot succeed without the public's trust. It\u2019s time to get serious about regulatory oversight, and that\u2019s what I will do as President. That starts with the core principles for reform that I discussed at Cooper Union.\n\n\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re a financial institution that can borrow from the government, you should be subject to government oversight and supervision. When the Federal Reserve steps in as a lender of last resort, it is providing an insurance policy underwritten by the American taxpayer. In return, taxpayers have every right to expect that financial institutions with access to that credit are not taking excessive risks.\n\n\n\nSecond, we must reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions. We must strengthen capital requirements, particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities and other derivatives at the center of our current crisis. We must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk. We must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating. And we must establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties. As we reform our regulatory system at home, we must address the same problems abroad so that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road.\n\n\n\nThird, we need to streamline our regulatory agencies. Our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape. Different institutions compete in multiple markets - Washington should not pretend otherwise. A streamlined system will provide better oversight and reduce costs.\n\n\n\nFourth, we need to regulate institutions for what they do, not what they are. Over the last few years, commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies. This regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners, and made no sense for our financial system. When it comes to protecting the American people, it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with.\n\n\n\nFifth, we must crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation. The last six months have shown that this remains a serious problem in many markets and becomes especially problematic during moments of great financial turmoil. We cannot embrace the administration's vision of turning over the protection of investors to the industries themselves. We need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them. The SEC should investigate and punish market manipulation, and report its conclusions to Congress.\n\n\n\nSixth, we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy. Too often, we end up where we are today: dealing with threats to the financial system that weren't anticipated by regulators. We need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the President, Congress, and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face. It\u2019s time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full-blown crisis.\n\n\n\nThese six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a 21st century regulatory system. But the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation. Financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks. There is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers don't understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions. It's time to realign incentives and CEO compensation packages, so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders.\n\n\n\nFinally, the American people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us - not the special interests that have set the agenda in Washington for eight years, and the lobbyists who run John McCain\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve spent my career taking on lobbyists and their money, and I\u2019ve won. If you wanted a special favor in Illinois, there was actually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their own personal use. In the State House, they called it business-as-usual. I called it legalized bribery, and while it didn\u2019t make me the most popular guy in Springfield, I put an end to it.\n\n\n\nWhen I got to Washington, we saw some of the worst corruption since Watergate. I led the fight for reform in my party, and let me tell you \u2013 not everyone in my party was too happy about it. When I proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they\u2019re raising money from and who in Congress they\u2019re funneling it to, I had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the Senate. But we got it done, and we banned gifts from lobbyists, and free rides on their fancy jets. And I am the only candidate who can say that Washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign, they will not run my White House, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President of the United States. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to end the outrage of special interests tipping the scales.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing we must do is restore opportunity for all Americans. To get our economy growing, we need to recapture that fundamental American promise. That if you work hard, you can pay the bills. That if you get sick, you won\u2019t go bankrupt. That your kids can get a good education, and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the change the American people need. While Senator McCain likes to talk about change these days, his economic program offers nothing but more of the same. The American people need more than change as a slogan\u2013 we need change that makes a real difference in your life.\n\n\n\nChange means a tax code that doesn\u2019t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start-ups \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019ll grow our economy and create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI will cut taxes \u2013 cut taxes \u2013 for 95% of all working families. My opponent doesn\u2019t want you to know this, but under my plan, tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan. If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increase one single dime. In fact, I offer three times the tax relief for middle-class families as Senator McCain does \u2013 because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.\n\n\n\nI will finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most\n\n\n\nI will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy. We\u2019ll tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I\u2019ll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I\u2019ll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I\u2019ll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy \u2013 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can\u2019t ever be outsourced\n\n\n\nAnd now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. I\u2019ll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. But in exchange, I will ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American \u2013 if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.\n\n\n\nThis is the change we need \u2013 the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the American economy by advancing the dreams of all Americans.\n\n\n\nTimes are hard. I will not pretend that the changes we need will come without cost \u2013 though I have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way. I know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity.\n\n\n\nBut I am running for President because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for Wall Street instead of Main Street, and ends up devastating both.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings. I don\u2019t want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete, our children\u2019s future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt, and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing.\n\n\n\nThis time \u2013 this election \u2013 is our chance to stand up and say: enough is enough!\n\n\n\nWe can do this because Americans have done this before. Time and again, we\u2019ve battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other\u2019s success. That\u2019s why our economy hasn\u2019t just been the world\u2019s greatest wealth generator \u2013 it\u2019s bound America together, it\u2019s created jobs, and it\u2019s made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of Americans.\n\n\n\nNow it falls to us. And I need you to make it happen. If you want the next four years looking just like the last eight, then I am not your candidate. But if you want real change \u2013 if you want an economy that rewards work, and that works for Main Street and Wall Street; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs; if you want health care you can afford and education so that our kids can compete; then I ask you to knock on some doors, and make some calls, and talk to your neighbors, and give me your vote on November 4th. And if you do, I promise you \u2013 we will win Colorado, we will win this election, and we will change America together.\n\n\n\n", "comment_3": "Marathon Pundit: Obama's hypocrisy on equal pay for women: From Barack Obama's campaign web site:Desp.. http://tinyurl.com/438846", "split": "train"}

WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, we're here in Ohio. Senator Obama is here. This is the debate. You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me.\n\nAnd therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.\n\nYou know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.\n\nAnd Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.\n\nMatt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from.\n\nSo I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside.\n\nI do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.\n\nI have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out.\n\nAccording to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.\n\nThe reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate. That is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.\n\nAnd the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.\n\nNow, Senator Clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate. She hasn't indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable. And so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.\n\nBut I think it's very important to understand the context of this, and that is that Senator Clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.\n\nAnd, you know, we haven't whined about it because I understand that's the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that Senator Clinton has taken throughout this campaign I think is simply not accurate.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator Clinton, on this subject --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: But I have to -- I have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly we've had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our campaign. But this is an issue that goes to the heart of whether or not this country will finally do what is right, and that is to provide quality affordable health care to every single person.\n\nSenator Obama has a mandate in his plan. It's a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children. That's about 150 million people who would be required to do that. The difference between Senator Obama and myself is that I know, from the work I've done on health care for many years, that if everyone's not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do what's called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.\n\nWe will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.\n\nAnd most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the University of Pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care. That's a core Democratic Party value. It's something that ever since Harry Truman we have stood for.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd what I find regrettable is that in Senator Obama's mailing that he has sent out across Ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the Republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts who've evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it. It is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.\n\nSEN. OBAMA (?): (Inaudible.)\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So I think it's imperative that we stand as Democrats for universal health care. I've staked out a claim for that. Senator Edwards did. Others have. But Senator Obama has not.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, look, I believe in universal health care, as does Senator Clinton. And this is -- this is, I think, the point of the debate, is that Senator Clinton repeatedly claims that I don't stand for universal health care. And, you know, for Senator Clinton to say that, I think, is simply not accurate.\n\nEvery expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it. President Clinton's own secretary of Labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across Ohio, all across Texas, Rhode Island, Vermont, all across America, will be able to obtain it. And we do more to reduce costs than any other plan that's been out there.\n\nNow, I have no objection to Senator Clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as we've heard tonight, we still don't know how Senator Clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we don't know the level of subsidies that she's going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still can't afford it, even with the subsidies.\n\nAnd they are then worse off. They then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: That is a genuine difference between myself and Senator Clinton.\n\nAnd the last point I would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate. The insurance companies don't mind making sure that everybody has to purchase their product. That's not something they're objecting to. The question is, are we going to make sure that it is affordable for everybody? And that's my goal when I'm president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, as you two --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Brian -- Brian, wait a minute. I've got -- this is too important.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama has a mandate. He would enforce the mandate by requiring parents to buy insurance for their children.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: This is true.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is the case.\n\nIf you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable. So there's no difference here.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, there is a difference.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: It's just that I know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children. So you can insure the children, and then you've got the bread-winner who can't afford health insurance or doesn't have it for him or herself.\n\nAnd in fact, it would be as though Franklin Roosevelt said let's make Social Security voluntary -- that's -- you know, that's -- let's let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if President Johnson said let's make Medicare voluntary.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, let me --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: What we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up. It's like when you get a 401(k), it's your employer. The employer automatically enrolls you. You would be enrolled.\n\nAnd under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan. A comparison of the plans like the ones we're proposing found that actually I would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than Senator Obama's plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but I would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income. So it will be affordable.\n\nNow, if you want to say that we shouldn't try to get everyone into health insurance, that's a big difference, because I believe if we don't have universal health care, we will never provide prevention.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have the most aggressive measures to reduce costs and improve quality. And time and time again, people who have compared our two approaches have concluded that.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Brian, I'm sorry.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So let's -- let's have a debate about the facts.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm going to get filibuttered -- I'm getting filibustered a little bit here.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: The last answer on this topic.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I mean, it is just not accurate to say that Senator Clinton does more to control costs than mine. That is not the case. There are many experts who have concluded that she does not.\n\nI do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price. On the -- on the point of many adults, we don't want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized. And that is what Senator Clinton's plan does.\n\nNow, I am -- I am happy to have a discussion with Senator Clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care. What I do not accept -- and which is what Senator Clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say there's no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.\n\nBut it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care. That is an area where I believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it. In fact, Medicare Part B is not mandated, it is voluntary. And yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, Hillary, and the reason they choose to purchase it is because it's a good deal. And if people in Cleveland or anywhere in Ohio end up seeing a plan that is affordable for them, I promise you they are snatching it up because they are desperate to get health care. And that's what I intend to provide as president of the United States.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, I'm going to change the subject.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: About 20 percent of -- about 20 percent of the people who are uninsured have the means to buy insurance. They're often young people --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- who think they're immortal --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Which is why I cover them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- except when the illness or the accident strikes. And what Senator Obama has said, that then, once you get to the hospital, you'll be forced to buy insurance, I don't think that's a good idea. We ought to plan for it --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and we ought to make sure we cover everyone.\n\nThat is the only way to get to universal health care coverage.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is what I've worked for for 15 years --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and I believe that we can achieve it. But if we don't even have a plan to get there, and we start out by leaving people, you'll never ever control costs, improve quality, and cover everyone.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect to the young people, my plan specifically says that up until the age of 25 you will be able to be covered under your parents' insurance plan, so that cohort that\n\nSenator Clinton is talking about will, in fact, have coverage.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, a 16-minute discussion on health care is certainly a start. (Laughter.) I'd like to change up --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, there's hardly anything be more important? I think it would be good to talk about health care and how we're we going get to universal health care.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I -- well, here's another important topic, and that's NAFTA, especially where we're sitting here tonight. And this is a tough one depending on who you ask. The Houston Chronicle has called it a big win for Texas, but Ohio Democratic Senator Brown, your colleague in the Senate, has called it a job-killing trade agreement. Senator Clinton, you've campaigned in south Texas. You've campaigned here in Ohio. Who's right?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, can I just point out that in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time. And I don't mind. I -- you know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious, and if anybody saw \"Saturday Night Live,\" you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow. (Laughter, boos.) I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues. But I'm happy to answer it.\n\nYou know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. I said that it worked in some parts of our country, and I've seen the results in Texas. I was in Laredo in the last couple of days. It's the largest inland port in America now. So clearly, some parts of our country have been benefited.\n\nBut what I have seen, where I represent up-state New York, I've seen the factories closed and moved. I've talked to so many people whose children have left because they don't have a good shot. I've had to negotiate to try to keep factories open, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, because the companies got tax benefits to actually move to another country.\n\nSo what I have said is that we need to have a plan to fix NAFTA. I would immediately have a trade timeout, and I would take that time to try to fix NAFTA by making it clear that we'll have core labor and environmental standards in the agreement.\n\nWe will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\n\nAnd if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear.\n\nBased on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: \"If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months.\n\nThe president can say to Canada and Mexico, we are out. This has not been a good agreement.\" Will U.S. president say we are out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, so obviously, you'd have to say to Canada and Mexico that that's exactly what we're going to do. But you know, in fairness --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Just because -- maybe Clinton --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, I am serious.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: You will get out. You will notify Mexico and Canada, NAFTA is gone in six months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I will say we will opt out of NAFTA unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America.\n\nBut let's be fair here, Tim. There are lots of parts of New York that have benefitted, just like there are lots of parts of Texas that have benefitted. The problem is in places like upstate New York, places like Youngstown, Toledo, and others throughout Ohio that have not benefitted. And if you look at what I have been saying, it has been consistent.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama told the farmers of Illinois a couple of years ago that he wanted more trade agreements. I -- right now --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: We're going to get -- we're going to get to Senator Obama, but I want to stay on your terms --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but that -- but that is important --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: -- because this was something that you wrote about as a real success for your husband. You said it was good on balance for New York and America in 2004, and now you're in Ohio and your words are much different, Senator. The record is very clear.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I -- I -- you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so.\n\nBut you know, Tim, when you look at what the Cleveland Plain Dealer said when they examined the kind of criticism that Senator Obama was making of me -- it's not me saying it -- they said it was erroneous. And it was erroneous because it didn't look at the entire picture, both at what I've said and what I've done.\n\nBut let's talk about what we're going to do. It is not enough just to criticize NAFTA, which I have, and for some years now. I have put forward a very specific plan about what I would do, and it does include telling Canada and Mexico that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labor and environmental standards -- not side agreements, but core agreements; that we will enhance the enforcement mechanism; and that we will have a very clear view of how we're going to review NAFTA going forward to make sure it works, and we're going to take out the ability of foreign companies to sue us because of what we do to protect our workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI would also say that you can go back and look at from the very beginning -- I think David Gergen was on TV today remembering that I was very skeptical about it.\n\nIt has worked in some parts of America. It has not worked in Ohio. It has not worked in upstate New York. And since I've been in the Senate -- neither of us voted on this. That wasn't something either of us got to cast an independent vote on. Since I have been in the Senate, I have worked to try to ameliorate the impact of these trade agreements.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But let me button this up. Absent the change that you're suggesting, you are willing to opt out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that NAFTA had been helpful. The Associated Press today ran a story about NAFTA, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue. Simple question: Will you, as president, say to Canada and Mexico, \"This has not worked for us; we are out\"?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that Senator Clinton talked about. And I think actually Senator Clinton's answer on this one is right. I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced. And that is not what has been happening so far.\n\nThat is something that I have been consistent about. I have to say, Tim, with respect to my position on this, when I ran for the United States Senate, the Chicago Tribune, which was adamantly pro-NAFTA, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to NAFTA.\n\nAnd that conversation that I had with the Farm Bureau, I was not ambivalent at all. What I said was that NAFTA and other trade deals can be beneficial to the United States because I believe every U.S. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody. And we can't shy away from globalization. We can't draw a moat around us. But what I did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is we've been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and what's good for multinationals, and we haven't been looking at what's good for communities here in Ohio, in my home state of Illinois, and across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd as president, what I want to be is an advocate on behalf of workers. Look, you know, when I go to these plants, I meet people who are proud of their jobs. They are proud of the products that they've created. They have built brands and profits for their companies. And when they see jobs shipped overseas and suddenly they are left not just without a job, but without health care, without a pension, and are having to look for seven-buck-an-hour jobs at the local fast-food joint, that is devastating on them, but it's also devastating on the community. That's not the way that we're going to prosper as we move forward.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator, two journalists here in Ohio wrote a piece called \"Business as Usual,\" which is very well known, suggesting it wasn't trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the Ph.D.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state.\n\nThe fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever. Ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to Canada and Mexico. Are you sure this has not been better for Ohio than you're suggesting?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm positive it hasn't been better for Ohio. But you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/can't ?) be the only part of our economic agenda. But we've seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers.\n\nWhat do we have to do? We're going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that we're competitive. And I've got a plan to do that. We're going to have to invest in science and technology. We've got to vastly improve our education system. We have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in Ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient.\n\nWe can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade. So there are all sorts of things that we're going to have to do to make the United States economy much more competitive, and those are plans that I have put forward in this campaign and I expect to pursue as president of the United States of America.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, on the issue of jobs, I watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in Wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable. And I've had a chance to read it very carefully. It does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years.\n\nAnd I was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in Buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down Route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate New York. There's been a net loss of 30,000 jobs. And when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told The Buffalo News, \"I might have been a little exuberant.\" Tonight will you say that the pledge of 5 million jobs might be a little exuberant?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, Tim, because what happened in 2000 is that I thought Al Gore was going to be president. And when I made the pledge I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity.\n\nAnd as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term I have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal. And the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- I mean, this is not a big leap. Twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the Clinton administration under my husband. We can create at least 5 million new jobs.\n\nI'm not just talking about it. I helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs. I want to see people throughout Ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and I know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the Democrats wanted, as I originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.\n\nYou know, take a country like Germany. They made a big bet on solar power. They have a smaller economy and population than ours.\n\nThey've created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that have to be done in Youngstown, in Dayton, in Cincinnati. These are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through. So I do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Brian?\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, yesterday Senator Clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and I'm going to read you a quote from it. Quote, \"We've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We cannot let that happen again. America has already taken that chance one time too many.\" Some of the comments in the speech were more pointed. The senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of George W. Bush at the same period. Provided you could be going into a general election against a Republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Senator Clinton I think equates experience with longevity in Washington. I don't think the American people do and I don't think that if you look at the judgments that we've made over the last several years that that's the accurate measure. On the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into Iraq -- I was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-American sentiment -- that it would distract us from Afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and I do not believe it has made us more safe.\n\nAl Qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both Senator Clinton and I are talking about. So on Pakistan, during the summer I suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards Musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd many people said at the time well, you can't target those terrorists because Musharraf is our ally and we don't want to offend him. In fact, what we had was neither stability in Pakistan nor democracy in Pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in Pakistan we would be much further along now than we are. So on the critical issues that actually matter I believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that I think has been superior to Senator Clinton's as well as Senator McCain's.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, Senator Clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not Senator Obama was qualified to be commander in chief. Is your contention in this latest speech that America would somehow be taking a chance on Senator Obama as commander in chief?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to Beijing and standing up for women's rights as human rights and so much else. And every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, Senator Obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. He's to be commended for having given the speech. Many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didn't have responsibility, he didn't have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war. And when he came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same. We have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently. So the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasn't just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference? Where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?\n\nAnd on a number of other issues, I just believe that, you know, as Senator Obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take. I have long advocated a much tougher approach to Musharraf and to Pakistan, and have pushed the White House to do that.\n\nAnd I disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.\n\nSo I think you've got to look at, you know, what I have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee for now five years. And I think that, you know, standing on that stage with Senator McCain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, I will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really America must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Let me just follow up. My objections to the war in Iraq were simply -- not simply a speech. I was in the midst of a U.S. Senate campaign. It was a high-stakes campaign. I was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and I was very specific as to why.\n\nAnd so when I bring this up, it is not simply to say \"I told you so,\" but it is to give you an insight in terms of how I would make decisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder. It was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then we've voted the same way. Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out. The question is, who's making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch? And the fact is that Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to George Bush on day one on this critical issue. So the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we can't afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the United States of America.\n\nWith respect to Pakistan, I never said I would bomb Pakistan. What I said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin Laden or other key al Qaeda officials, and we -- and Pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should. And just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al Qaeda official.\n\nThat is the position that we should have taken in the first place. And President Musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we don't know how the new legislature in Pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.\n\nAnd so my claim is not simply based on a speech. It is based on the judgments that I've displayed during the course of my service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while I've been in the United States Senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, I think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against Bush and Cheney. And that is how we're going to be able to debate John McCain. Having a debate with John McCain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, I think, does not put you in a strong position.\n\nTim Russert.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I guess that --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about Iraq, because this is important, I think, to Democratic voters particularly. You both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. You both have said you'd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al Qaeda, to neutralize Iran. If the Iraqi government said, President Clinton or President Obama, you're pulling out your troops this quickly?\n\nYou're going to be gone in a year, but you're going to leave a residual force behind? No. Get out. Get out now. If you don't want to stay and protect us, we're a sovereign nation. Go home now.\" Will you leave?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, if the Iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there. This is a sovereign government, as George Bush continually reminds us.\n\nNow, I think that we can be in a partnership with Iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of Iraqis and to meet our national security interests.\n\nBut in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why I have said that as soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed. We will provide them continued support. But it is important for us not to be held hostage by the Iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, that's distracting us from Afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in America that will make us more competitive and more safe.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, if the Iraqis said I'm sorry, we're not happy with this arrangement; if you're not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. And I believe that there is no military solution that the Americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the Iraqi government. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me ask -- let me ask you this, Senator. I want to ask you --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: And they need to take responsibility for themselves. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask both of you this question, then. If we -- if this scenario plays out and the Americans get out in total and al Qaeda resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals. And I believe that what's --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But this is reality.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No -- well, it isn't reality. You're -- you're -- you're making lots of different hypothetical assessments.\n\nI believe that it is in America's interests and in the interests of the Iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal. I've been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and I've been pushing them to actually do it. I've also said that I would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that I asked begun to be put together as soon as I became president.\n\nAnd I think we can take out one to two brigades a month. I've also been a leader in trying to prevent President Bush from getting us committed to staying in Iraq regardless for as long as Senator McCain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.\n\nSo, when you talk about what we need to do in Iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of America. And I believe this is in the best interest.\n\nBut I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.\n\nYou have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, I want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee. But also, do you reserve a right as American president to go back into Iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI have been very clear in talking to the American people about what I would do with respect to Afghanistan.\n\nI think we have to have more troops there to bolster the NATO effort. I think we have to show that we are not maintaining permanent bases in Iraq because Secretary Gates, our current Defense secretary, indicated that we are getting resistance from our allies to put more troops into Afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in Iraq and I think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in Afghanistan in part because of what's happened in Iraq.\n\nNow, I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests. And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad. So that is true, I think, not just in Iraq, but that's true in other places. That's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan.\n\nI think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on Americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator, I need to reserve --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but I have -- I just have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Senator, I've got to --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Now wait a minute, I have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I've got to get us to a break because television doesn't stop.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- Iraq.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Can you hold that thought until we come back from a break? We have limited commercial interruptions tonight, and we have to get to one of them now. Despite the snowstorm swirling outside here in Cleveland, we're having a warm night in the arena. We'll return to it right after this. (Laughter, applause.)\n\n(Announcements.)\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back, and because our first segment went long and we are in a large arena -- (cheers, applause) --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mike) -- for Hillary!\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: -- we are just now welcoming back both of our candidates to the stage and asking our cooperation of the audience.\n\nWe're back live tonight in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSenator Obama, we started tonight talking about what could be construed as a little hyperbole. Happens from time to time on the campaign trail. You have recently been called out on some yourself. I urge you to look at your monitor and we'll take a look.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (From videotape.) Now I could stand up here and say: Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open -- (laughter) -- the light will come down -- (laughter) -- celestial choirs will be singing -- (laughter) -- and everyone will know we should do the right thing, and the world will be perfect!\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Sounds good! (Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Of all the charges -- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (Chuckles.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: That was Senator Clinton. But since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: How did you take those remarks when you heard them?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I thought Senator Clinton showed some good humor there. I would give her points for delivery.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Look, I understand the broader point that Senator Clinton's been trying to make over the last several weeks. You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service, that's how I brought Democrats and Republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, that's how I helped to reform a welfare system that wasn't working in Illinois, that's how I've provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so I'm very proud of that track record.\n\nAnd if Senator Clinton thinks that it's all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at Walter Reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before I got to the Senate. And I changed that law. Or talk to those folks who I think have recognized that special interests are dominating Washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in Ohio.\n\nAnd so when I pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists can't get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of Congress and they have to disclose who they're getting money from and who they're bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.\n\nJust one point I'll make, I was in Cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one. And these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they don't have health care. One of them doesn't have a job. One of them is looking after an aging parent. Two of them were looking after disabled children. One of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job. And you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them. That is not who George Bush or Dick Cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.\n\nAnd so I am not interested in talk. I am not interested in speeches. I would not be running if I wasn't absolutely convinced that I can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the American dream.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, let me ask you, Senator Clinton: What did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I was having a little fun. You know, it's hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.\n\nBut the larger point is that I know trying to get health insurance for every American that's affordable will not be easy. It's not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody it's the right thing to do. You know, 15 years ago I tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and I know it takes a fighter. It takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.\n\nYou know, I have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies. These have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the White House did, but because members of Congress went along. And I want to get that money back and invest it in the American middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout Ohio, because what I hear as I go from Toledo to Parma to Cleveland to, you know, Dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but they're not getting ahead. They feel like they're invisible to their government. So when it came time to vote on Dick Cheney's energy bill, I voted no, and Senator Obama voted yes. When it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which I think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- I voted yes and Senator Obama voted no.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator -- Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight. And I believe that I am a fighter, and I will fight for the people of Ohio and the people of America.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: What I was attempting to do here is to show something Senator Obama said about you, and I'm told it's ready.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let's try it.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's try it. Hang on. Watch your monitor.\n\nLet's try it. We're going to come back to you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: But I'm going to have an opportunity to respond to this.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (From videotape.) -- herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of. And so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isn't politically convenient, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Now, Senator Obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but I've been wanting to ask you about this assertion that Senator Clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that when Senator Clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, \"Here's what I did.\"\n\n\"Here's what we did.\" \"Here's what we accomplished\" -- which is fine.\n\nAnd I have not -- I have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and I don't begrudge her claiming that as experience. What I've said, and what I would continue to maintain, is you can't take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like NAFTA, you say, well, I -- behind the scenes, I was disagreeing. That doesn't work. So you have to, I think, take both responsibility as well as credit.\n\nNow there are several points that I think Senator Clinton made that I -- we need to discuss here. First of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards. Keep in mind, I objected to the entire bill -- a bill that Senator Clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for. And in one of the debates with you guys said, well, I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass -- which, as a general rule, doesn't work. If you don't want it to pass, you vote against it. (Laughter.)\n\nYou know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care. And look -- I do not in any way doubt that Senator Clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all Americans.\n\nWhat I have said is that the way she approached it back in '93, I think, was wrong in part because she had the view that what's required is simply to fight. And Senator Clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party. And as a consequence, there were a number of people, like Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Bill Bradley and Pat Moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations. And we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.\n\nI am absolutely clear that hope is not enough. And it is not going to be easy to pass health care. If it was, it would have already gotten done. It's not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country. ExxonMobil made $11 billion last quarter. They are not going to give up those profits easily.\n\nBut what I also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, we're going to have to mobilize and inspire the American people so that they're paying attention to what their government is doing. And that's what I've been doing in this campaign, and that's what I will do as president.\n\nAnd there's nothing romantic or silly about that. If the American people are activated, that's how change is going to happen.\n\nThe second thing we've going to have to do is we're actually going to have to go after the special interests.\n\nSenator Clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you can't just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away. That is absolutely true, but it doesn't help if you're taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests. They are less likely to go away.\n\nSo it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence Congress. And yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the American people to get involved and pay attention.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word. Nothing more important. Last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out. You checked \"Yes\" on a questionnaire. And now Senator McCain has said, calling your bluff, let's do it. You seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.\n\nWhy won't you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Tim, I am not yet the nominee. Now, what I've said is, is that when I am the nominee, if I am the nominee -- because we've still got a bunch of contests left and Senator Clinton's a pretty tough opponent. If I am the nominee, then I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because Tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.\n\nSenator McCain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people aren't exactly clear whether all the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.\n\nNow what I want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign. I said very early on I would not take PAC money. I would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists. That -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because I had confidence that the American people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.\n\nWe have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50. We average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the American people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody who's interested in good government and politics supports.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So you may opt out of public financing. You may break your word.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: What I -- what I have said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility. You have loaned your campaign $5 million. You and your husband file a joint return. You refuse to release that joint return, even though former President Clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.\n\nYour chief supporter here in Ohio, Governor Strickland, made releasing his opponent's tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, \"Accountability, transparency.\" If he's not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding? We should question what's going on.\n\nWhy won't you release your tax return, so the voters of Ohio, Texas, Vermont, Rhode Island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, the American people who support me are bankrolling my campaign. That's -- that's obvious. You can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that I've gotten. And ever since I lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously. I'm thrilled at so many people getting involved. And we're raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the Internet. And if anybody's out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to HillaryClinton.com, because that's who's funding my campaign.\n\nAnd I will release my tax returns. I have consistently said that. And I will --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Why not now?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, Tim, because I have been as open as I can be.\n\nYou have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and I have very extensive filings with the Senate where --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So, before next Tuesday's primary?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I can't get it together by then, but I will certainly work to get it together. I'm a little busy right now; I hardly have time to sleep. But I will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: One other issue. You talked about releasing documents. On January 30th, the National Archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady. It's now in the custody of former President Clinton. Will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. I've urged that the process be as quick as possible. It's a cumbersome process, set up by law. It doesn't just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position. And I have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can. Now, also, President Bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and I would urge the Bush White House to move as quickly as possible.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But you've had it for more than a month. Will you get to him -- will you get it to the White House immediately?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: As soon as we can, Tim. I've urged that, and I hope it will happen.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.\n\nOn Sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, Chicago Tribune: \"Louis Farrakhan Backs Obama for President at Nation of Islam Convention in Chicago.\" Do you accept the support of Louis Farrakhan?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can't censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we're not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Do you reject his support?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Tim, you know, I can't say to somebody that he can't say that he thinks I'm a good guy. (Laughter.) You know, I -- you know, I -- I have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and I think that indicates to the American people what my stance is on those comments.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: The problem some voters may have is, as you know, Reverend Farrakhan called Judaism \"gutter religion.\"\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I think -- I am very familiar with his record, as are the American people. That's why I have consistently denounced it.\n\nThis is not something new. This is something that -- I live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I've been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.\n\nRUSSERT: The title of one of your books, \"Audacity of Hope,\" you acknowledge you got from a sermon from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the head of the Trinity United Church. He said that Louis Farrakhan \"epitomizes greatness.\"\n\nHe said that he went to Libya in 1984 with Louis Farrakhan to visit with Moammar Gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, \"your Jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in Hell.\"\n\nRUSSERT: What do you do to assure Jewish-Americans that, whether it's Farrakhan's support or the activities of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding Israel and not in any way suggesting that Farrakhan epitomizes greatness?\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have some of the strongest support from the Jewish community in my hometown of Chicago and in this presidential campaign. And the reason is because I have been a stalwart friend of Israel's. I think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and I think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the United States is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the Jewish community.\n\nAnd the reason that I have such strong support is because they know that not only would I not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what I want to do is rebuild what I consider to be a historic relationship between the African-American community and the Jewish community.\n\nYou know, I would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of Jewish Americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the South. And that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.\n\nBut, you know, the reason that I have such strong support in the Jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my U.S. Senate campaign and it's true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that I consistently have not only befriended the Jewish community, not only have I been strong on Israel, but, more importantly, I've been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.\n\nWhen I was -- just last point I would make -- when I was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in conjunction with Martin Luther King's birthday in front of a large African-American audience, I specifically spoke out against anti- Semitism within the African-American community. And that's what gives people confidence that I will continue to do that when I'm president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator...\n\nCLINTON: I just want to add something here, because I faced a similar situation when I ran for the Senate in 2000 in New York. And in New York, there are more than the two parties, Democratic and Republican. And one of the parties at that time, the Independence Party, was under the control of people who were anti-Semitic, anti- Israel. And I made it very clear that I did not want their support. I rejected it. I said that it would not be anything I would be comfortable with. And it looked as though I might pay a price for that. But I would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either Israel or Jewish people in our country.\n\nAnd, you know, I was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of New York supported me and I won. But at the time, I thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.\n\nRUSSERT: Are you suggesting Senator Obama is not standing on principle?\n\nCLINTON: No. I'm just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it. And there's a difference between denouncing and rejecting. And I think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- I have no doubt that everything that Barack just said is absolutely sincere. But I just think, we've got to be even stronger. We cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have to say I don't see a difference between denouncing and rejecting. There's no formal offer of help from Minister Farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it. But if the word \"reject\" Senator Clinton feels is stronger than the word \"denounce,\" then I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce.\n\nCLINTON: Good. Good. Excellent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWILLIAMS: Rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.\n\nWe're going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks. We'll be back live from Cleveland right after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWILLIAMS: We are back from Cleveland State University. We continue with our debate.\n\nThe question beginning this segment is for you, Senator Obama.\n\nThe National Journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of Ted Kennedy.\n\nIn a general election, going up against a Republican Party, looking for converts, Republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than Ted Kennedy?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, let's take a look at what the National Journal rated us on.\n\nIt turned out that Senator Clinton and I had differences on two votes. The first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldn't go back, and I thought it was bad policy.\n\nThe second -- and this, I think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- I supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the Senate, because I thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the Senate, that they weren't being investigated by the Senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.\n\nThis is something that I've tried to push as part of my ethics package.\n\nOBAMA: It was rejected. And according to the National Journal, that position is a liberal position.\n\nNow, I don't think that's a liberal position. I think there are a lot of Republicans and a lot of Independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated. So the categories don't make sense.\n\nAnd part of the reason I think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that Senator Obama's campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more Independent votes than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, and Republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head? It's because people don't want to go back to those old categories of what's liberal and what's conservative.\n\nThey want to see who is making sense, who's fighting for them, who's going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense? That's what I've been doing, and that's why, you know, the proof is in the pudding. We've been attracting more Independent and Republican support than anybody else, and that's why every poll shows that right now I beat John McCain in a match-up in the general election.\n\nWILLIAMS: Let's go from domestic to foreign affairs and Tim Russert.\n\nRUSSERT: Before the primary on Tuesday, on Sunday, March 2, there's an election in Russia for the successor to President Putin. What can you tell me about the man who's going to be Mr. Putin's successor?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I can tell you that he's a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by Putin, who Putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know. You know, there's a lot of information still to be acquired. That the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against Putin's hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising Putin. So this is a clever but transparent way for Putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how we're going to deal with Russia going forward.\n\nI have been very critical of the Bush administration for what I believe to have been an incoherent policy toward Russia. And with the reassertion of Russia's role in Europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting Iran's nuclear ambitions, for example, it's imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward Russia. But I have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by Putin.\n\nRUSSERT: Who will it be? Do you know his name?\n\nCLINTON: Medvedev -- whatever.\n\nRUSSERT: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yes.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, do you know anything about him?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think Senator Clinton speaks accurately about him. He is somebody who was hand-picked by Putin. Putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in Russia in terms of running the government. And, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of President Bush's administration when he said -- you know, he met with Putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.\n\nHe then proceeded to neglect our relationship with Russia at a time when Putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his European neighbors, as well as satellites of the former Soviet Union. And so we did not send a signal to Mr. Putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us. That is something that we have to change.\n\nRUSSERT: He's 42 years old, he's a former law professor. He is Mr. Putin's campaign manager. He is going to be the new president of Russia. And if he says to the Russian troops, you know what, why don't you go help Serbia retake Kosovo, what does President Obama do?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that we work with the international community that has also recognized Kosovo, and state that that's unacceptable. But, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in NATO to deal with this issue.\n\nWe don't have to work in isolation. And this is an area where I think that the Clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.\n\nOBAMA: It has not been perfect, but it saved lives. And we created a situation in which not only Kosovo, but other parts of the former Yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader European community.\n\nBut, you know, be very clear: We have recognized the country of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has Great Britain and many other countries in the region. And I think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.\n\nRUSSERT: Before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service. Looking back through them, is there any words or vote that you'd like to take back?\n\nSenator Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, obviously, I've said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding Iraq was a sincere vote, I would not have voted that way again.\n\nI would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in Iraq. And I regret deeply that President Bush waged a preemptive war, which I warned against and said I disagreed with.\n\nBut I think that this election has to be about the future. It has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what we're going to inherit.\n\nYou know, we've just been talking about Russia. We could have gone around the world. We could have gone to Latin America and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy. We could have talked about Africa and the failure to end the genocide in Darfur.\n\nWe could have gone on to talk about the challenge that China faces and the Middle East, which is deteriorating under the pressures of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the interference that is putting Israel's security at stake.\n\nWe could have done an entire program, Tim, on what we will inherit from George Bush.\n\nAnd what I believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with Putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we don't have much time to try to make up for our losses.\n\nRUSSERT: But to be clear, you'd like to have your vote back?\n\nCLINTON: Absolutely. I've said that many times.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, any statements or vote you'd like to take back?\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, when I first arrived in the Senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding Terri Schiavo. And I remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed Congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.\n\nIt wasn't something I was comfortable with, but it was not something that I stood on the floor and stopped. And I think that was a mistake, and I think the American people understood that that was a mistake. And as a constitutional law professor, I knew better.\n\nAnd so that's an example I think of where inaction...\n\nRUSSERT: This is the young woman with the feeding tube...\n\nOBAMA: That's exactly right.\n\nRUSSERT: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.\n\nOBAMA: And I think that's an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.\n\nBut let me say this, since we're wrapping up this debate. We have gone through 20 debates now. And, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and we've got four coming up, and maybe more after that.\n\nBut the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is Senator Clinton has campaigned magnificently. She is an outstanding public servant. And I'm very proud to have been campaigning with her.\n\nAnd part of what I think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the American people.\n\nYou know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics. But when you spend as much time as Senator Clinton and I have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that people's expectations are so modest.\n\nYou know, they're not looking for government to solve all of their problems. They just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if they're about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the American dream.\n\nYou know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in Washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.\n\nAnd, you know, I have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the Democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government. That's why I think we're both running, and I'm very pleased that I've had this opportunity to run with Senator Clinton.\n\nRUSSERT: But the voters can only choose one, Brian.\n\nRUSSERT: And I think you have a question.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, we don't have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but I am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both. And I'll ask it of you fist, Senator Obama.\n\nWhat is the fundamental question you believe Senator Clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in Ohio and in Texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee? And then we will ask the same question of Senator Clinton.\n\nOBAMA: I have to say, Brian, I think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee. Now, I think I'd be better. Otherwise, I wouldn't be running. But there's no doubt that Senator Clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than John McCain, who I respect and I honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of George Bush over the last seven years.\n\nOn economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we can't afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we can't afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe. We can't afford it in terms of strategy.\n\nSo I don't think that Senator Clinton has to answer a question as to whether she's capable of being president or our standard bearer.\n\nI will say this, that the reason I think I'm better as the nominee is that I can bring this country together I think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region. And that is what's going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both Senator Clinton and I care so much about.\n\nAnd I also think I have a track record, starting from the days I moved to Chicago as a community organizer, when I was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a United States senator, I think I bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the American people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.\n\nThose are things -- those are qualities that I bring to this race, and I hope that the people of Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question Senator Obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Brian, there isn't any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the White House.\n\nAs I said last week, you know, it's been an honor to campaign. I still intend to do everything I can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.\n\nYou know, obviously I am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which I think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.\n\nSo I feel that either one of us will make history.\n\nThe question that I have been posing is, who can actually change the country? And I do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.\n\nYou know, when I wasn't successful about getting universal health care, I didn't give up. I just got to work and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. And, you know, today in Ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance. And yet this morning in Lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident. And she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, \"will you help us?\"\n\nThat's what my public life has been about. I want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have. And I will do whatever I can here in Ohio, in Texas, Rhode Island, in the states to come making that case. Because I think we do need a fighter back in the White House.\n\nYou know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president. It's time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can. And they deserve somebody who gets up in that White House and goes to bat for them.\n\nAnd that's what I will do.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.", "comment_3": "The Tories and Lib Dems are political enemies to Labour, a democratic socialist party\n\nAusterity harms the sick &amp; d\u2026 https://t.co/53m9o6WUaH", "split": "train"}

WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, we're here in Ohio. Senator Obama is here. This is the debate. You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me.\n\nAnd therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.\n\nYou know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.\n\nAnd Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.\n\nMatt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from.\n\nSo I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside.\n\nI do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.\n\nI have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out.\n\nAccording to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.\n\nThe reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate. That is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.\n\nAnd the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.\n\nNow, Senator Clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate. She hasn't indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable. And so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.\n\nBut I think it's very important to understand the context of this, and that is that Senator Clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.\n\nAnd, you know, we haven't whined about it because I understand that's the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that Senator Clinton has taken throughout this campaign I think is simply not accurate.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator Clinton, on this subject --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: But I have to -- I have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly we've had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our campaign. But this is an issue that goes to the heart of whether or not this country will finally do what is right, and that is to provide quality affordable health care to every single person.\n\nSenator Obama has a mandate in his plan. It's a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children. That's about 150 million people who would be required to do that. The difference between Senator Obama and myself is that I know, from the work I've done on health care for many years, that if everyone's not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do what's called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.\n\nWe will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.\n\nAnd most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the University of Pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care. That's a core Democratic Party value. It's something that ever since Harry Truman we have stood for.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd what I find regrettable is that in Senator Obama's mailing that he has sent out across Ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the Republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts who've evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it. It is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.\n\nSEN. OBAMA (?): (Inaudible.)\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So I think it's imperative that we stand as Democrats for universal health care. I've staked out a claim for that. Senator Edwards did. Others have. But Senator Obama has not.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, look, I believe in universal health care, as does Senator Clinton. And this is -- this is, I think, the point of the debate, is that Senator Clinton repeatedly claims that I don't stand for universal health care. And, you know, for Senator Clinton to say that, I think, is simply not accurate.\n\nEvery expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it. President Clinton's own secretary of Labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across Ohio, all across Texas, Rhode Island, Vermont, all across America, will be able to obtain it. And we do more to reduce costs than any other plan that's been out there.\n\nNow, I have no objection to Senator Clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as we've heard tonight, we still don't know how Senator Clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we don't know the level of subsidies that she's going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still can't afford it, even with the subsidies.\n\nAnd they are then worse off. They then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: That is a genuine difference between myself and Senator Clinton.\n\nAnd the last point I would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate. The insurance companies don't mind making sure that everybody has to purchase their product. That's not something they're objecting to. The question is, are we going to make sure that it is affordable for everybody? And that's my goal when I'm president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, as you two --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Brian -- Brian, wait a minute. I've got -- this is too important.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama has a mandate. He would enforce the mandate by requiring parents to buy insurance for their children.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: This is true.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is the case.\n\nIf you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable. So there's no difference here.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: No, there is a difference.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: It's just that I know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children. So you can insure the children, and then you've got the bread-winner who can't afford health insurance or doesn't have it for him or herself.\n\nAnd in fact, it would be as though Franklin Roosevelt said let's make Social Security voluntary -- that's -- you know, that's -- let's let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if President Johnson said let's make Medicare voluntary.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, let me --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: What we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up. It's like when you get a 401(k), it's your employer. The employer automatically enrolls you. You would be enrolled.\n\nAnd under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan. A comparison of the plans like the ones we're proposing found that actually I would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than Senator Obama's plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but I would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income. So it will be affordable.\n\nNow, if you want to say that we shouldn't try to get everyone into health insurance, that's a big difference, because I believe if we don't have universal health care, we will never provide prevention.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have the most aggressive measures to reduce costs and improve quality. And time and time again, people who have compared our two approaches have concluded that.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Brian, I'm sorry.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So let's -- let's have a debate about the facts.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm going to get filibuttered -- I'm getting filibustered a little bit here.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: The last answer on this topic.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I mean, it is just not accurate to say that Senator Clinton does more to control costs than mine. That is not the case. There are many experts who have concluded that she does not.\n\nI do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price. On the -- on the point of many adults, we don't want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized. And that is what Senator Clinton's plan does.\n\nNow, I am -- I am happy to have a discussion with Senator Clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care. What I do not accept -- and which is what Senator Clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say there's no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.\n\nBut it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care. That is an area where I believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it. In fact, Medicare Part B is not mandated, it is voluntary. And yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, Hillary, and the reason they choose to purchase it is because it's a good deal. And if people in Cleveland or anywhere in Ohio end up seeing a plan that is affordable for them, I promise you they are snatching it up because they are desperate to get health care. And that's what I intend to provide as president of the United States.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, I'm going to change the subject.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: About 20 percent of -- about 20 percent of the people who are uninsured have the means to buy insurance. They're often young people --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- who think they're immortal --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Which is why I cover them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- except when the illness or the accident strikes. And what Senator Obama has said, that then, once you get to the hospital, you'll be forced to buy insurance, I don't think that's a good idea. We ought to plan for it --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and we ought to make sure we cover everyone.\n\nThat is the only way to get to universal health care coverage.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: That is what I've worked for for 15 years --\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- and I believe that we can achieve it. But if we don't even have a plan to get there, and we start out by leaving people, you'll never ever control costs, improve quality, and cover everyone.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: With respect to the young people, my plan specifically says that up until the age of 25 you will be able to be covered under your parents' insurance plan, so that cohort that\n\nSenator Clinton is talking about will, in fact, have coverage.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, a 16-minute discussion on health care is certainly a start. (Laughter.) I'd like to change up --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, there's hardly anything be more important? I think it would be good to talk about health care and how we're we going get to universal health care.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I -- well, here's another important topic, and that's NAFTA, especially where we're sitting here tonight. And this is a tough one depending on who you ask. The Houston Chronicle has called it a big win for Texas, but Ohio Democratic Senator Brown, your colleague in the Senate, has called it a job-killing trade agreement. Senator Clinton, you've campaigned in south Texas. You've campaigned here in Ohio. Who's right?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, can I just point out that in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time. And I don't mind. I -- you know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious, and if anybody saw \"Saturday Night Live,\" you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow. (Laughter, boos.) I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues. But I'm happy to answer it.\n\nYou know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. I said that it worked in some parts of our country, and I've seen the results in Texas. I was in Laredo in the last couple of days. It's the largest inland port in America now. So clearly, some parts of our country have been benefited.\n\nBut what I have seen, where I represent up-state New York, I've seen the factories closed and moved. I've talked to so many people whose children have left because they don't have a good shot. I've had to negotiate to try to keep factories open, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, because the companies got tax benefits to actually move to another country.\n\nSo what I have said is that we need to have a plan to fix NAFTA. I would immediately have a trade timeout, and I would take that time to try to fix NAFTA by making it clear that we'll have core labor and environmental standards in the agreement.\n\nWe will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe.\n\nThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\n\nAnd if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear.\n\nBased on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: \"If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months.\n\nThe president can say to Canada and Mexico, we are out. This has not been a good agreement.\" Will U.S. president say we are out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, so obviously, you'd have to say to Canada and Mexico that that's exactly what we're going to do. But you know, in fairness --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Just because -- maybe Clinton --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, I am serious.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: You will get out. You will notify Mexico and Canada, NAFTA is gone in six months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I will say we will opt out of NAFTA unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America.\n\nBut let's be fair here, Tim. There are lots of parts of New York that have benefitted, just like there are lots of parts of Texas that have benefitted. The problem is in places like upstate New York, places like Youngstown, Toledo, and others throughout Ohio that have not benefitted. And if you look at what I have been saying, it has been consistent.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama told the farmers of Illinois a couple of years ago that he wanted more trade agreements. I -- right now --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: We're going to get -- we're going to get to Senator Obama, but I want to stay on your terms --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but that -- but that is important --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: -- because this was something that you wrote about as a real success for your husband. You said it was good on balance for New York and America in 2004, and now you're in Ohio and your words are much different, Senator. The record is very clear.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I -- I -- you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so.\n\nBut you know, Tim, when you look at what the Cleveland Plain Dealer said when they examined the kind of criticism that Senator Obama was making of me -- it's not me saying it -- they said it was erroneous. And it was erroneous because it didn't look at the entire picture, both at what I've said and what I've done.\n\nBut let's talk about what we're going to do. It is not enough just to criticize NAFTA, which I have, and for some years now. I have put forward a very specific plan about what I would do, and it does include telling Canada and Mexico that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labor and environmental standards -- not side agreements, but core agreements; that we will enhance the enforcement mechanism; and that we will have a very clear view of how we're going to review NAFTA going forward to make sure it works, and we're going to take out the ability of foreign companies to sue us because of what we do to protect our workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI would also say that you can go back and look at from the very beginning -- I think David Gergen was on TV today remembering that I was very skeptical about it.\n\nIt has worked in some parts of America. It has not worked in Ohio. It has not worked in upstate New York. And since I've been in the Senate -- neither of us voted on this. That wasn't something either of us got to cast an independent vote on. Since I have been in the Senate, I have worked to try to ameliorate the impact of these trade agreements.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But let me button this up. Absent the change that you're suggesting, you are willing to opt out of NAFTA in six months?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that NAFTA had been helpful. The Associated Press today ran a story about NAFTA, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue. Simple question: Will you, as president, say to Canada and Mexico, \"This has not worked for us; we are out\"?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that Senator Clinton talked about. And I think actually Senator Clinton's answer on this one is right. I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced. And that is not what has been happening so far.\n\nThat is something that I have been consistent about. I have to say, Tim, with respect to my position on this, when I ran for the United States Senate, the Chicago Tribune, which was adamantly pro-NAFTA, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to NAFTA.\n\nAnd that conversation that I had with the Farm Bureau, I was not ambivalent at all. What I said was that NAFTA and other trade deals can be beneficial to the United States because I believe every U.S. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody. And we can't shy away from globalization. We can't draw a moat around us. But what I did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is we've been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and what's good for multinationals, and we haven't been looking at what's good for communities here in Ohio, in my home state of Illinois, and across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd as president, what I want to be is an advocate on behalf of workers. Look, you know, when I go to these plants, I meet people who are proud of their jobs. They are proud of the products that they've created. They have built brands and profits for their companies. And when they see jobs shipped overseas and suddenly they are left not just without a job, but without health care, without a pension, and are having to look for seven-buck-an-hour jobs at the local fast-food joint, that is devastating on them, but it's also devastating on the community. That's not the way that we're going to prosper as we move forward.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator, two journalists here in Ohio wrote a piece called \"Business as Usual,\" which is very well known, suggesting it wasn't trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the Ph.D.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state.\n\nThe fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever. Ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to Canada and Mexico. Are you sure this has not been better for Ohio than you're suggesting?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm positive it hasn't been better for Ohio. But you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/can't ?) be the only part of our economic agenda. But we've seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers.\n\nWhat do we have to do? We're going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that we're competitive. And I've got a plan to do that. We're going to have to invest in science and technology. We've got to vastly improve our education system. We have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in Ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient.\n\nWe can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade. So there are all sorts of things that we're going to have to do to make the United States economy much more competitive, and those are plans that I have put forward in this campaign and I expect to pursue as president of the United States of America.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, on the issue of jobs, I watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in Wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable. And I've had a chance to read it very carefully. It does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years.\n\nAnd I was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in Buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down Route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate New York. There's been a net loss of 30,000 jobs. And when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told The Buffalo News, \"I might have been a little exuberant.\" Tonight will you say that the pledge of 5 million jobs might be a little exuberant?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No, Tim, because what happened in 2000 is that I thought Al Gore was going to be president. And when I made the pledge I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity.\n\nAnd as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term I have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal. And the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- I mean, this is not a big leap. Twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the Clinton administration under my husband. We can create at least 5 million new jobs.\n\nI'm not just talking about it. I helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs. I want to see people throughout Ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and I know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the Democrats wanted, as I originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.\n\nYou know, take a country like Germany. They made a big bet on solar power. They have a smaller economy and population than ours.\n\nThey've created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that have to be done in Youngstown, in Dayton, in Cincinnati. These are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through. So I do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Brian?\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, yesterday Senator Clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and I'm going to read you a quote from it. Quote, \"We've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We cannot let that happen again. America has already taken that chance one time too many.\" Some of the comments in the speech were more pointed. The senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of George W. Bush at the same period. Provided you could be going into a general election against a Republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Senator Clinton I think equates experience with longevity in Washington. I don't think the American people do and I don't think that if you look at the judgments that we've made over the last several years that that's the accurate measure. On the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into Iraq -- I was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-American sentiment -- that it would distract us from Afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and I do not believe it has made us more safe.\n\nAl Qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both Senator Clinton and I are talking about. So on Pakistan, during the summer I suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards Musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd many people said at the time well, you can't target those terrorists because Musharraf is our ally and we don't want to offend him. In fact, what we had was neither stability in Pakistan nor democracy in Pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in Pakistan we would be much further along now than we are. So on the critical issues that actually matter I believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that I think has been superior to Senator Clinton's as well as Senator McCain's.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, Senator Clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not Senator Obama was qualified to be commander in chief. Is your contention in this latest speech that America would somehow be taking a chance on Senator Obama as commander in chief?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to Beijing and standing up for women's rights as human rights and so much else. And every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, Senator Obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. He's to be commended for having given the speech. Many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didn't have responsibility, he didn't have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war. And when he came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same. We have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently. So the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasn't just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference? Where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?\n\nAnd on a number of other issues, I just believe that, you know, as Senator Obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take. I have long advocated a much tougher approach to Musharraf and to Pakistan, and have pushed the White House to do that.\n\nAnd I disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.\n\nSo I think you've got to look at, you know, what I have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee for now five years. And I think that, you know, standing on that stage with Senator McCain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, I will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really America must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Let me just follow up. My objections to the war in Iraq were simply -- not simply a speech. I was in the midst of a U.S. Senate campaign. It was a high-stakes campaign. I was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and I was very specific as to why.\n\nAnd so when I bring this up, it is not simply to say \"I told you so,\" but it is to give you an insight in terms of how I would make decisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder. It was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then we've voted the same way. Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out. The question is, who's making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch? And the fact is that Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to George Bush on day one on this critical issue. So the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we can't afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the United States of America.\n\nWith respect to Pakistan, I never said I would bomb Pakistan. What I said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin Laden or other key al Qaeda officials, and we -- and Pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should. And just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al Qaeda official.\n\nThat is the position that we should have taken in the first place. And President Musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we don't know how the new legislature in Pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.\n\nAnd so my claim is not simply based on a speech. It is based on the judgments that I've displayed during the course of my service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while I've been in the United States Senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, I think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against Bush and Cheney. And that is how we're going to be able to debate John McCain. Having a debate with John McCain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, I think, does not put you in a strong position.\n\nTim Russert.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I guess that --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about Iraq, because this is important, I think, to Democratic voters particularly. You both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. You both have said you'd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al Qaeda, to neutralize Iran. If the Iraqi government said, President Clinton or President Obama, you're pulling out your troops this quickly?\n\nYou're going to be gone in a year, but you're going to leave a residual force behind? No. Get out. Get out now. If you don't want to stay and protect us, we're a sovereign nation. Go home now.\" Will you leave?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, if the Iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there. This is a sovereign government, as George Bush continually reminds us.\n\nNow, I think that we can be in a partnership with Iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of Iraqis and to meet our national security interests.\n\nBut in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why I have said that as soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed. We will provide them continued support. But it is important for us not to be held hostage by the Iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, that's distracting us from Afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in America that will make us more competitive and more safe.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, if the Iraqis said I'm sorry, we're not happy with this arrangement; if you're not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. And I believe that there is no military solution that the Americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the Iraqi government. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let me ask -- let me ask you this, Senator. I want to ask you --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: And they need to take responsibility for themselves. And --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask both of you this question, then. If we -- if this scenario plays out and the Americans get out in total and al Qaeda resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals. And I believe that what's --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But this is reality.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: No -- well, it isn't reality. You're -- you're -- you're making lots of different hypothetical assessments.\n\nI believe that it is in America's interests and in the interests of the Iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal. I've been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and I've been pushing them to actually do it. I've also said that I would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that I asked begun to be put together as soon as I became president.\n\nAnd I think we can take out one to two brigades a month. I've also been a leader in trying to prevent President Bush from getting us committed to staying in Iraq regardless for as long as Senator McCain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.\n\nSo, when you talk about what we need to do in Iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of America. And I believe this is in the best interest.\n\nBut I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.\n\nYou have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, I want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee. But also, do you reserve a right as American president to go back into Iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI have been very clear in talking to the American people about what I would do with respect to Afghanistan.\n\nI think we have to have more troops there to bolster the NATO effort. I think we have to show that we are not maintaining permanent bases in Iraq because Secretary Gates, our current Defense secretary, indicated that we are getting resistance from our allies to put more troops into Afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in Iraq and I think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in Afghanistan in part because of what's happened in Iraq.\n\nNow, I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests. And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad. So that is true, I think, not just in Iraq, but that's true in other places. That's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan.\n\nI think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on Americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator, I need to reserve --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but I have -- I just have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Senator, I've got to --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Now wait a minute, I have to add --\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: I've got to get us to a break because television doesn't stop.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- Iraq.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Can you hold that thought until we come back from a break? We have limited commercial interruptions tonight, and we have to get to one of them now. Despite the snowstorm swirling outside here in Cleveland, we're having a warm night in the arena. We'll return to it right after this. (Laughter, applause.)\n\n(Announcements.)\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back, and because our first segment went long and we are in a large arena -- (cheers, applause) --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mike) -- for Hillary!\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: -- we are just now welcoming back both of our candidates to the stage and asking our cooperation of the audience.\n\nWe're back live tonight in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSenator Obama, we started tonight talking about what could be construed as a little hyperbole. Happens from time to time on the campaign trail. You have recently been called out on some yourself. I urge you to look at your monitor and we'll take a look.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (From videotape.) Now I could stand up here and say: Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open -- (laughter) -- the light will come down -- (laughter) -- celestial choirs will be singing -- (laughter) -- and everyone will know we should do the right thing, and the world will be perfect!\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Sounds good! (Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Of all the charges -- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (Chuckles.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: That was Senator Clinton. But since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: How did you take those remarks when you heard them?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I thought Senator Clinton showed some good humor there. I would give her points for delivery.\n\nSEN. CLINTON: (Laughs.)\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Look, I understand the broader point that Senator Clinton's been trying to make over the last several weeks. You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service, that's how I brought Democrats and Republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, that's how I helped to reform a welfare system that wasn't working in Illinois, that's how I've provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so I'm very proud of that track record.\n\nAnd if Senator Clinton thinks that it's all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at Walter Reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before I got to the Senate. And I changed that law. Or talk to those folks who I think have recognized that special interests are dominating Washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in Ohio.\n\nAnd so when I pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists can't get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of Congress and they have to disclose who they're getting money from and who they're bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.\n\nJust one point I'll make, I was in Cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one. And these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they don't have health care. One of them doesn't have a job. One of them is looking after an aging parent. Two of them were looking after disabled children. One of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job. And you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them. That is not who George Bush or Dick Cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.\n\nAnd so I am not interested in talk. I am not interested in speeches. I would not be running if I wasn't absolutely convinced that I can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the American dream.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, let me ask you, Senator Clinton: What did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I was having a little fun. You know, it's hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.\n\nBut the larger point is that I know trying to get health insurance for every American that's affordable will not be easy. It's not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody it's the right thing to do. You know, 15 years ago I tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and I know it takes a fighter. It takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.\n\nYou know, I have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies. These have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the White House did, but because members of Congress went along. And I want to get that money back and invest it in the American middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout Ohio, because what I hear as I go from Toledo to Parma to Cleveland to, you know, Dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but they're not getting ahead. They feel like they're invisible to their government. So when it came time to vote on Dick Cheney's energy bill, I voted no, and Senator Obama voted yes. When it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which I think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- I voted yes and Senator Obama voted no.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: And Senator -- Senator --\n\nSEN. CLINTON: So part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight. And I believe that I am a fighter, and I will fight for the people of Ohio and the people of America.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: What I was attempting to do here is to show something Senator Obama said about you, and I'm told it's ready.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Let's try it.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's try it. Hang on. Watch your monitor.\n\nLet's try it. We're going to come back to you.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: But I'm going to have an opportunity to respond to this.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: (From videotape.) -- herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of. And so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isn't politically convenient, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Now, Senator Obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but I've been wanting to ask you about this assertion that Senator Clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that when Senator Clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, \"Here's what I did.\"\n\n\"Here's what we did.\" \"Here's what we accomplished\" -- which is fine.\n\nAnd I have not -- I have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and I don't begrudge her claiming that as experience. What I've said, and what I would continue to maintain, is you can't take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like NAFTA, you say, well, I -- behind the scenes, I was disagreeing. That doesn't work. So you have to, I think, take both responsibility as well as credit.\n\nNow there are several points that I think Senator Clinton made that I -- we need to discuss here. First of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards. Keep in mind, I objected to the entire bill -- a bill that Senator Clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for. And in one of the debates with you guys said, well, I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass -- which, as a general rule, doesn't work. If you don't want it to pass, you vote against it. (Laughter.)\n\nYou know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care. And look -- I do not in any way doubt that Senator Clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all Americans.\n\nWhat I have said is that the way she approached it back in '93, I think, was wrong in part because she had the view that what's required is simply to fight. And Senator Clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party. And as a consequence, there were a number of people, like Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Bill Bradley and Pat Moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations. And we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.\n\nI am absolutely clear that hope is not enough. And it is not going to be easy to pass health care. If it was, it would have already gotten done. It's not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country. ExxonMobil made $11 billion last quarter. They are not going to give up those profits easily.\n\nBut what I also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, we're going to have to mobilize and inspire the American people so that they're paying attention to what their government is doing. And that's what I've been doing in this campaign, and that's what I will do as president.\n\nAnd there's nothing romantic or silly about that. If the American people are activated, that's how change is going to happen.\n\nThe second thing we've going to have to do is we're actually going to have to go after the special interests.\n\nSenator Clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you can't just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away. That is absolutely true, but it doesn't help if you're taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests. They are less likely to go away.\n\nSo it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence Congress. And yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the American people to get involved and pay attention.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word. Nothing more important. Last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out. You checked \"Yes\" on a questionnaire. And now Senator McCain has said, calling your bluff, let's do it. You seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.\n\nWhy won't you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Tim, I am not yet the nominee. Now, what I've said is, is that when I am the nominee, if I am the nominee -- because we've still got a bunch of contests left and Senator Clinton's a pretty tough opponent. If I am the nominee, then I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because Tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.\n\nSenator McCain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people aren't exactly clear whether all the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.\n\nNow what I want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign. I said very early on I would not take PAC money. I would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists. That -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because I had confidence that the American people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.\n\nWe have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50. We average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the American people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody who's interested in good government and politics supports.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So you may opt out of public financing. You may break your word.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: What I -- what I have said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility. You have loaned your campaign $5 million. You and your husband file a joint return. You refuse to release that joint return, even though former President Clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.\n\nYour chief supporter here in Ohio, Governor Strickland, made releasing his opponent's tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, \"Accountability, transparency.\" If he's not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding? We should question what's going on.\n\nWhy won't you release your tax return, so the voters of Ohio, Texas, Vermont, Rhode Island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, the American people who support me are bankrolling my campaign. That's -- that's obvious. You can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that I've gotten. And ever since I lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously. I'm thrilled at so many people getting involved. And we're raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the Internet. And if anybody's out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to HillaryClinton.com, because that's who's funding my campaign.\n\nAnd I will release my tax returns. I have consistently said that. And I will --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Why not now?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, Tim, because I have been as open as I can be.\n\nYou have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and I have very extensive filings with the Senate where --\n\nMR. RUSSERT: So, before next Tuesday's primary?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I can't get it together by then, but I will certainly work to get it together. I'm a little busy right now; I hardly have time to sleep. But I will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: One other issue. You talked about releasing documents. On January 30th, the National Archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady. It's now in the custody of former President Clinton. Will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. I've urged that the process be as quick as possible. It's a cumbersome process, set up by law. It doesn't just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position. And I have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can. Now, also, President Bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and I would urge the Bush White House to move as quickly as possible.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: But you've had it for more than a month. Will you get to him -- will you get it to the White House immediately?\n\nSEN. CLINTON: As soon as we can, Tim. I've urged that, and I hope it will happen.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.\n\nOn Sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, Chicago Tribune: \"Louis Farrakhan Backs Obama for President at Nation of Islam Convention in Chicago.\" Do you accept the support of Louis Farrakhan?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can't censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we're not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: Do you reject his support?\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, Tim, you know, I can't say to somebody that he can't say that he thinks I'm a good guy. (Laughter.) You know, I -- you know, I -- I have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and I think that indicates to the American people what my stance is on those comments.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: The problem some voters may have is, as you know, Reverend Farrakhan called Judaism \"gutter religion.\"\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I think -- I am very familiar with his record, as are the American people. That's why I have consistently denounced it.\n\nThis is not something new. This is something that -- I live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I've been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.\n\nRUSSERT: The title of one of your books, \"Audacity of Hope,\" you acknowledge you got from a sermon from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the head of the Trinity United Church. He said that Louis Farrakhan \"epitomizes greatness.\"\n\nHe said that he went to Libya in 1984 with Louis Farrakhan to visit with Moammar Gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, \"your Jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in Hell.\"\n\nRUSSERT: What do you do to assure Jewish-Americans that, whether it's Farrakhan's support or the activities of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding Israel and not in any way suggesting that Farrakhan epitomizes greatness?\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have some of the strongest support from the Jewish community in my hometown of Chicago and in this presidential campaign. And the reason is because I have been a stalwart friend of Israel's. I think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and I think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the United States is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the Jewish community.\n\nAnd the reason that I have such strong support is because they know that not only would I not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what I want to do is rebuild what I consider to be a historic relationship between the African-American community and the Jewish community.\n\nYou know, I would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of Jewish Americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the South. And that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.\n\nBut, you know, the reason that I have such strong support in the Jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my U.S. Senate campaign and it's true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that I consistently have not only befriended the Jewish community, not only have I been strong on Israel, but, more importantly, I've been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.\n\nWhen I was -- just last point I would make -- when I was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in conjunction with Martin Luther King's birthday in front of a large African-American audience, I specifically spoke out against anti- Semitism within the African-American community. And that's what gives people confidence that I will continue to do that when I'm president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator...\n\nCLINTON: I just want to add something here, because I faced a similar situation when I ran for the Senate in 2000 in New York. And in New York, there are more than the two parties, Democratic and Republican. And one of the parties at that time, the Independence Party, was under the control of people who were anti-Semitic, anti- Israel. And I made it very clear that I did not want their support. I rejected it. I said that it would not be anything I would be comfortable with. And it looked as though I might pay a price for that. But I would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either Israel or Jewish people in our country.\n\nAnd, you know, I was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of New York supported me and I won. But at the time, I thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.\n\nRUSSERT: Are you suggesting Senator Obama is not standing on principle?\n\nCLINTON: No. I'm just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it. And there's a difference between denouncing and rejecting. And I think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- I have no doubt that everything that Barack just said is absolutely sincere. But I just think, we've got to be even stronger. We cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.\n\nOBAMA: Tim, I have to say I don't see a difference between denouncing and rejecting. There's no formal offer of help from Minister Farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it. But if the word \"reject\" Senator Clinton feels is stronger than the word \"denounce,\" then I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce.\n\nCLINTON: Good. Good. Excellent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWILLIAMS: Rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.\n\nWe're going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks. We'll be back live from Cleveland right after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWILLIAMS: We are back from Cleveland State University. We continue with our debate.\n\nThe question beginning this segment is for you, Senator Obama.\n\nThe National Journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of Ted Kennedy.\n\nIn a general election, going up against a Republican Party, looking for converts, Republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than Ted Kennedy?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, let's take a look at what the National Journal rated us on.\n\nIt turned out that Senator Clinton and I had differences on two votes. The first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldn't go back, and I thought it was bad policy.\n\nThe second -- and this, I think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- I supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the Senate, because I thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the Senate, that they weren't being investigated by the Senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.\n\nThis is something that I've tried to push as part of my ethics package.\n\nOBAMA: It was rejected. And according to the National Journal, that position is a liberal position.\n\nNow, I don't think that's a liberal position. I think there are a lot of Republicans and a lot of Independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated. So the categories don't make sense.\n\nAnd part of the reason I think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that Senator Obama's campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more Independent votes than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, and Republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head? It's because people don't want to go back to those old categories of what's liberal and what's conservative.\n\nThey want to see who is making sense, who's fighting for them, who's going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense? That's what I've been doing, and that's why, you know, the proof is in the pudding. We've been attracting more Independent and Republican support than anybody else, and that's why every poll shows that right now I beat John McCain in a match-up in the general election.\n\nWILLIAMS: Let's go from domestic to foreign affairs and Tim Russert.\n\nRUSSERT: Before the primary on Tuesday, on Sunday, March 2, there's an election in Russia for the successor to President Putin. What can you tell me about the man who's going to be Mr. Putin's successor?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I can tell you that he's a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by Putin, who Putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know. You know, there's a lot of information still to be acquired. That the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against Putin's hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising Putin. So this is a clever but transparent way for Putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how we're going to deal with Russia going forward.\n\nI have been very critical of the Bush administration for what I believe to have been an incoherent policy toward Russia. And with the reassertion of Russia's role in Europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting Iran's nuclear ambitions, for example, it's imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward Russia. But I have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by Putin.\n\nRUSSERT: Who will it be? Do you know his name?\n\nCLINTON: Medvedev -- whatever.\n\nRUSSERT: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yes.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, do you know anything about him?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think Senator Clinton speaks accurately about him. He is somebody who was hand-picked by Putin. Putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in Russia in terms of running the government. And, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of President Bush's administration when he said -- you know, he met with Putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.\n\nHe then proceeded to neglect our relationship with Russia at a time when Putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his European neighbors, as well as satellites of the former Soviet Union. And so we did not send a signal to Mr. Putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us. That is something that we have to change.\n\nRUSSERT: He's 42 years old, he's a former law professor. He is Mr. Putin's campaign manager. He is going to be the new president of Russia. And if he says to the Russian troops, you know what, why don't you go help Serbia retake Kosovo, what does President Obama do?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that we work with the international community that has also recognized Kosovo, and state that that's unacceptable. But, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in NATO to deal with this issue.\n\nWe don't have to work in isolation. And this is an area where I think that the Clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.\n\nOBAMA: It has not been perfect, but it saved lives. And we created a situation in which not only Kosovo, but other parts of the former Yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader European community.\n\nBut, you know, be very clear: We have recognized the country of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has Great Britain and many other countries in the region. And I think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.\n\nRUSSERT: Before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service. Looking back through them, is there any words or vote that you'd like to take back?\n\nSenator Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, obviously, I've said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding Iraq was a sincere vote, I would not have voted that way again.\n\nI would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in Iraq. And I regret deeply that President Bush waged a preemptive war, which I warned against and said I disagreed with.\n\nBut I think that this election has to be about the future. It has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what we're going to inherit.\n\nYou know, we've just been talking about Russia. We could have gone around the world. We could have gone to Latin America and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy. We could have talked about Africa and the failure to end the genocide in Darfur.\n\nWe could have gone on to talk about the challenge that China faces and the Middle East, which is deteriorating under the pressures of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the interference that is putting Israel's security at stake.\n\nWe could have done an entire program, Tim, on what we will inherit from George Bush.\n\nAnd what I believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with Putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we don't have much time to try to make up for our losses.\n\nRUSSERT: But to be clear, you'd like to have your vote back?\n\nCLINTON: Absolutely. I've said that many times.\n\nRUSSERT: Senator Obama, any statements or vote you'd like to take back?\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, when I first arrived in the Senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding Terri Schiavo. And I remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed Congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.\n\nIt wasn't something I was comfortable with, but it was not something that I stood on the floor and stopped. And I think that was a mistake, and I think the American people understood that that was a mistake. And as a constitutional law professor, I knew better.\n\nAnd so that's an example I think of where inaction...\n\nRUSSERT: This is the young woman with the feeding tube...\n\nOBAMA: That's exactly right.\n\nRUSSERT: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.\n\nOBAMA: And I think that's an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.\n\nBut let me say this, since we're wrapping up this debate. We have gone through 20 debates now. And, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and we've got four coming up, and maybe more after that.\n\nBut the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is Senator Clinton has campaigned magnificently. She is an outstanding public servant. And I'm very proud to have been campaigning with her.\n\nAnd part of what I think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the American people.\n\nYou know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics. But when you spend as much time as Senator Clinton and I have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that people's expectations are so modest.\n\nYou know, they're not looking for government to solve all of their problems. They just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if they're about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the American dream.\n\nYou know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in Washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.\n\nAnd, you know, I have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the Democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government. That's why I think we're both running, and I'm very pleased that I've had this opportunity to run with Senator Clinton.\n\nRUSSERT: But the voters can only choose one, Brian.\n\nRUSSERT: And I think you have a question.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, we don't have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but I am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both. And I'll ask it of you fist, Senator Obama.\n\nWhat is the fundamental question you believe Senator Clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in Ohio and in Texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee? And then we will ask the same question of Senator Clinton.\n\nOBAMA: I have to say, Brian, I think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee. Now, I think I'd be better. Otherwise, I wouldn't be running. But there's no doubt that Senator Clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than John McCain, who I respect and I honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of George Bush over the last seven years.\n\nOn economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we can't afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we can't afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe. We can't afford it in terms of strategy.\n\nSo I don't think that Senator Clinton has to answer a question as to whether she's capable of being president or our standard bearer.\n\nI will say this, that the reason I think I'm better as the nominee is that I can bring this country together I think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region. And that is what's going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both Senator Clinton and I care so much about.\n\nAnd I also think I have a track record, starting from the days I moved to Chicago as a community organizer, when I was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a United States senator, I think I bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the American people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.\n\nThose are things -- those are qualities that I bring to this race, and I hope that the people of Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the United States.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question Senator Obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Brian, there isn't any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the White House.\n\nAs I said last week, you know, it's been an honor to campaign. I still intend to do everything I can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.\n\nYou know, obviously I am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which I think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.\n\nSo I feel that either one of us will make history.\n\nThe question that I have been posing is, who can actually change the country? And I do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.\n\nYou know, when I wasn't successful about getting universal health care, I didn't give up. I just got to work and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. And, you know, today in Ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance. And yet this morning in Lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident. And she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, \"will you help us?\"\n\nThat's what my public life has been about. I want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have. And I will do whatever I can here in Ohio, in Texas, Rhode Island, in the states to come making that case. Because I think we do need a fighter back in the White House.\n\nYou know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president. It's time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can. And they deserve somebody who gets up in that White House and goes to bat for them.\n\nAnd that's what I will do.\n\nWILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.", "comment_3": "\"Transcript: Democratic Presidential Debate in Brooklyn\" by Unknown Author via NYT https://t.co/Ief3Pr0sUD", "split": "train"}

It has to do with standing up for our human rights, including freedom of religion.\"\n\nAmong the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 were more than 30 Muslims, she noted.\n\nOpponents of the Islamic center project argue it's insensitive to the families and memories of Sept. 11 victims to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion.\n\nThe new coalition was started by members of 40 civic and religious organizations that \"spontaneously called each other, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,\" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York office of the watchdog group Common Cause.\n\nThe controversy was triggered by \"irresponsible politicians\" using it as an election issue, she said. Names mentioned at the rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nGingrich has suggested that building the mosque near ground zero is akin to putting a Nazi sign \"next to the Holocaust Museum.\" Reid has broken ranks with President Barack Obama by saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere.\n\nCoalition members are now contacting officials, asking them to support the project as a reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of \"crude stereotypes meant to frighten and divide us.\"\n\nThey plan a candlelight vigil near ground zero on Sept. 10, the eve of the ninth Sept. 11 anniversary.\n\n\"This is not just about Muslims; this is about who we are as Americans,\" said Lerner, adding that to oppose the Islamic center is \"a slippery slope. There will always be people who are offended standing next to people who are different from others.\"\n\nRabbi Arthur Waskow, director of New York's Shalom Center, said the project will show the world a form of Islam that espouses peace \u2014 not the Islam of the terrorists.\n\n\"It is right; it is wise to build it,\" he told hundreds of people gathered under the arches of Manhattan's Municipal Building, a short walk from ground zero.\n\nSeveral coalition members noted that the mosque site's developer, Sharif el-Gamal, modeled it after the Jewish Community Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

Trump Seeks Distance From 'Advisor' With Past Ties Mafia - ABC News - https://t.co/2u7SBTidK6", "target": "real", "comment_1": "From Dec 2015: Memory Lapse? Trump Seeks Distance From 'Advisor' With Past Ties to Mafia - ABC News - https://t.co/u8CnvHJozR via @ABC", "article": "Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss.\n\nEven though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country.\n\n\u201cIf he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,\u201d Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.\n\nAway from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title \u201cSenior Advisor to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. \"Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,\" he told the reporter. \"I'm not that familiar with him.\"\n\nTrump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump\u2019s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a \u201csenior advisor\" to Trump.\n\nSater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his \u201cmost prized project.\u201d For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a \"senior advisor\" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump\u2019s attorney about it, that portion of Sater\u2019s online resume was deleted.\n\nThe \u201csenior advisor\u201d title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.\n\nAlan Garten, Trump\u2019s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump \u201chad no real direct relationship with Felix Sater\u201d and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump \u201cin my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater\u2019s Trump business card with the \u201csenior advisor\u201d title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater\u2019s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles \u201cin order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.\u201d\n\nCyrus McCrimmon/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nGarten said Sater was \u201cnever employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization\u201d and that \u201cno deals ever came from those activities\u201d in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater\u2019s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.\n\nTrump\u2019s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe cast of characters who participated in Trump\u2019s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his \u201ctremendous\u201d record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.\n\nThe connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.\n\nAs Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when \u201csomebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children\u201d with a proposal for a development deal. \u201cIt could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut somebody from Bayrock.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nSater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.\u201d Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.\n\nAs he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million \u201cpump and dump\u201d stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had \u201cplanned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,\u201d the release said.\n\nProsecutors said Sater and others had \u201cenlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.\u201d\n\nSater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past \"at your own risk\" but did not cite specific concerns.\n\nDuring this period, Sater\u2019s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the \u201cchief operating officer\u201d or \u201cmanaging director.\u201d In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. \u201cI was probably number two man in the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actual position, I don't remember what it was.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.\n\nDuring this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, \u201cexquisite gardens,\u201d and \u201ca world-class celebrity chef restaurant.\u201d\n\nThe project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against \u201cthe Trump/Bayrock Organization,\u201d the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to \u201celectrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.\u201d\n\nSater\u2019s lawyer calls the allegation \u201can outright fabrication\u201d made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.\n\nReached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump\u2019s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.\n\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Garten told ABC News, \u201cMr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.\u201d\n\nSater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater\u2019s ties to Trump and describing his \u201ctangled past.\u201d The article reported that Sater \u201chad been an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.\u201d\n\nSater told the Times that activity was in the past. \u201cI\u2019m trying to lead an exemplary existence,\u201d he said then. \u201cOld, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.\u201d\n\nWhile Sater\u2019s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a \u201ccooperator\u201d on a range of matters.\n\nSater\u2019s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.\n\n\u201cThe defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,\u201d her statement said. He provided information \u201ccrucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.\u201d\n\nGarten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was \u201csurprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no idea,\u201d Garten said. It \u201cwas the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.\u201d\n\nGarten added, \u201cWhen you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it\u2019s just not appropriate.\"\n\nOnce that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump \u201ccut all ties\u201d with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.\n\nAsked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, \u201cYou\u2019re going to look at the deal, you\u2019re not going to look at the broker.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater\u2019s past, Trump said he knew Sater had \u201cgot into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.\u201d And, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well, but I don\u2019t think he was connected to the mafia.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn\u2019t say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.\n\n\u201cI hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,\u201d he said, walking out of the room.\n\nTrump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.\n\nIn August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul\u2019s past dealings with Sater. \"I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,\" Lewandowski replied. \"I've never heard of the guy.\u201d\n\nFor investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.\n\nCathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown \u2013 which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump\u2019s photos and such slogans as \"There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.\"\n\n\u201cI invested because it was Trump,\u201d Cather told ABC News.\n\nABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report.", "comment_3": "Memory Lapse?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nGRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Forty Republican members of Congress are furious at ABC News. They say ABC News is unprofessional and violating the ethics of journalism and slanting the news for President Obama. ABC News has been given all access to the White House, and in a primetime special on ABC News, President Obama will talk about his health care plan. Any problem with that? A group called the Media Fairness Caucus says yes and wrote a letter to ABC News slamming the network.\n\nCongressman Lamar Smith heads the Media Fairness Caucus. He was supposed to be with us live but is busy voting, but he does join us by phone. Congressman, nice to at least hear from you. Tell me, Congressman, what's wrong with this?\n\nREP. LAMAR SMITH - R - TEXAS (VIA TELEPHONE): Very good to be with you. Well, what's wrong with this is, as you just mentioned, ABC devoted all their newscasts today, morning, noon, evening, and then they culminated in a town hall meeting from the White House tonight with a hand-picked audience, and the president had the last word. That really amounts to a day-long informational (SIC). It's not giving the American people the facts. It's not letting them make up their own minds. It's telling them what to think. And it is unprofessional. The code of ethics for journalists says that they have a duty to provide a fair and comprehensive account (INAUDIBLE) issues. Clearly, this is not...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you -- OK, all right, I haven't seen this code of ethics. Lawyers have a code of professional responsibility, which I'm always quick to point out. Here's the thing. Everything that happened today on ABC is recorded or Tivoed or we have access to it. Now that ABC News has done that, we now know the White House -- we should know the comprehensive view of the White House on health care. Doesn't it instead give all of us an opportunity to go over it with a fine-toothed comb tomorrow to see what we like and what we don't like? Is there any problem with that?\n\nSMITH: No, we should, but the problem is, we only heard one side. Anybody who was watching ABC today...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: We'll hear it tomorrow. We'll hear it tomorrow. I mean, people are going to pick it apart tomorrow. In some ways, now at least we know what the White House, what the president's doing.\n\nSMITH: We certainly know...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Tomorrow we can pick apart.\n\nSMITH: Yes. Well, I hope -- you know, if ABC allows individuals to pick it apart tomorrow, those watching ABC will get both sides. But right now, they've only gotten one side. And it was like...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Yes, but...\n\nSMITH: It was like a rigged football game. They had -- the president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, the ads is a wholly different thing. And I'll agree with you on the ads. But tomorrow, I bet that FOX, CNN, even MSNBC and NBC and CBS -- I bet they will all be critiquing what the president said about health care.\n\nSMITH: Well...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: And but for this forum tonight -- and it's almost like a direct examination was tonight and now tomorrow, everybody can cross- examine it. And but for today, we wouldn't have that chance.\n\nSMITH: Right. But the problem with that is that the three networks, who have 10 times the number of viewers as FOX, for example -- they have 24 million viewers. FOX has 2.5 million. But the problem is that those three networks have all been given slanted coverage to the president's health care plan. You have ABC -- since January, for example, they interviewed 58 people in favor of the health care plan, only 18 opposed, three to one. They are not presenting both sides. And the American people deserve to get both sides if they're going to be able to make good decisions.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, one hour on ABC is 44 minutes, taking into account all the -- ABC News -- taking into account all the commercials. Tomorrow, there's going to be -- you know, the 24/7 of all the cables, so I'm not so sure -- and I realize that they have more viewers on broadcast as opposed to cable news, but we have so much more time on it that I'm not -- you know, that I don't know how it'll balance out.\n\nBut I guess -- I guess the other thing is, that -- you know, it's, like, it seems to me that this is an opportunity for all of us, for Americans to now -- to look at it with a fine-toothed comb. And I may be the only one who's not scandalized by it, and frankly, I haven't yet seen it, so I got to take a look at it, so...\n\nSMITH: Well, it's...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... it may even be premature for me to be scandalized anyway.\n\nSMITH: If you'd seen how one-sided it is, you'd be scandalized because it is not representing good journalism. It has not presented both sides. It is not giving the American people the facts. You have a recent Gallup poll, for example, that says on 9 percent of the American people think the news media reports the news accurately and fairly -- 9 percent. So the...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, that's another -- that's -- that's a whole other issue, but Congressman, maybe -- let's see in 24 hours whether or not everybody has gone over this and -- with a fine-toothed comb. You may be right, but let's at least give it a shot tomorrow, see whether this has been...\n\nSMITH: Well, I...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... dissected.\n\nSMITH: I hope people will take the time to look at the other side. They certainly didn't get it from ABC.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, for joining us.\n\nSMITH: Thank you.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Sorry it couldn't be in person because I know you're busy voting. Thank you, sir.\n\nSMITH: All right. Bye-bye.\n\n\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2009 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's a pleasure to be here, and especially to receive the Keeper of the Flame Award in the company of so many good friends.\n\nI'm told that among those you've recognized before me was my friend Don Rumsfeld. I don't mind that a bit. It fits something of a pattern. In a career that includes being chief of staff, congressman, and secretary of defense, I haven't had much that Don didn't get first. But truth be told, any award once conferred on Donald Rumsfeld carries extra luster, and I am very proud to see my name added to such a distinguished list.\n\nTo Frank Gaffney and all the supporters of Center for Security Policy, I thank you for this honor. And I thank you for the great energy and high intelligence you bring to as vital a cause as there is - the advance of freedom and the uncompromising defense of the United States.\n\nMost anyone who is given responsibility in matters of national security quickly comes to appreciate the commitments and structures put in place by others who came before. You deploy a military force that was planned and funded by your predecessors. You inherit relationships with partners and obligations to allies that were first undertaken years and even generations earlier. With the authority you hold for a little while, you have great freedom of action. And whatever course you follow, the essential thing is always to keep commitments, and to leave no doubts about the credibility of your country's word.\n\nSo among my other concerns about the drift of events under the present administration, I consider the abandonment of missile defense in Eastern Europe to be a strategic blunder and a breach of good faith.\n\nIt is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls. It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic. Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved, just like that - with apparently little, if any, consultation. Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland, it was an odd way to mark the occasion.\n\nYou hardly have to go back to 1939 to understand why these countries desire - and thought they had - a close and trusting relationship with the United States. Only last year, the Russian Army moved into Georgia, under the orders of a man who regards the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century. Anybody who has spent much time in that part of the world knows what Vladimir Putin is up to. And those who try placating him, by conceding ground and accommodating his wishes, will get nothing in return but more trouble.\n\nWhat did the Obama Administration get from Russia for its abandonment of Poland and the Czech Republic, and for its famous \"Reset\" button? Another deeply flawed election and continued Russian opposition to sanctioning Iran for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn the short of it, President Obama's cancellation of America's agreements with the Polish and Czech governments was a serious blow to the hopes and aspirations of millions of Europeans. For twenty years, these peoples have done nothing but strive to move closer to us, and to gain the opportunities and security that America offered. These are faithful friends and NATO allies, and they deserve better. The impact of making two NATO allies walk the plank won't be felt only in Europe. Our friends throughout the world are watching and wondering whether America will abandon them as well.\n\nBig events turn on the credibility of the United States - doing what we said we would do, and always defending our fundamental security interests. In that category belong the ongoing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the need to counter the nuclear ambitions of the current regime in Iran.\n\nCandidate Obama declared last year that he would be willing to sit down with Iran's leader without preconditions. As President, he has\n\ncommitted America to an Iran strategy that seems to treat engagement as an objective rather than a tactic. Time and time again, he has outstretched his hand to the Islamic Republic's authoritarian leaders, and all the while Iran has continued to provide lethal support to extremists and terrorists who are killing American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic continues to provide support to extremists in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, the regime continues to spin centrifuges and test missiles. And these are just the activities we know about.\n\nI have long been skeptical of engagement with the current regime in\n\nTehran, but even Iran experts who previously advocated for engagement have changed their tune since the rigged elections this past June and the brutal suppression of Iran's democratic protestors. The administration clearly missed an opportunity to stand with Iran's\n\ndemocrats, whose popular protests represent the greatest challenge to the Islamic Republic since its founding in 1979. Instead, the\n\nPresident has been largely silent about the violent crackdown on Iran's protestors, and has moved blindly forward to engage Iran's authoritarian regime. Unless the Islamic Republic fears real consequences from the United States and the international community, it is hard to see how diplomacy will work.\n\nNext door in Iraq, it is vitally important that President Obama, in his rush to withdraw troops, not undermine the progress we've made in recent years. Prime Minister Maliki met yesterday with\n\nPresident Obama, who began his press availability with an extended\n\ncomment about Afghanistan. When he finally got around to talking\n\nabout Iraq, he told the media that he reiterated to Maliki his\n\nintention to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq. Former President\n\nBush's bold decision to change strategy in Iraq and surge U.S. forces there set the stage for success in that country. Iraq has the potential to be a strong, democratic ally in the war on terrorism, and an example of economic and democratic reform in the heart of the Middle East. The Obama Administration has an obligation to protect this young democracy and build on the strategic success we have achieved in Iraq.\n\nWe should all be concerned as well with the direction of policy on Afghanistan. For quite a while, the cause of our military in that country went pretty much unquestioned, even on the left. The effort was routinely praised by way of contrast to Iraq, which many wrote off as a failure until the surge proved them wrong. Now suddenly - and despite our success in Iraq - we're hearing a drumbeat of defeatism over Afghanistan. These criticisms carry the same air of hopelessness, they offer the same short-sighted arguments for walking away, and they should be summarily rejected for the same reasons of national security.\n\nHaving announced his Afghanistan strategy last March, President Obama now seems afraid to make a decision, and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete his mission.\n\nPresident Obama has said he understands the stakes for America. When he announced his new strategy he couched the need to succeed in the starkest possible terms, saying, quote, \"If the Afghan government falls to the Taliban - or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged - that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.\" End quote.\n\nFive months later, in August of this year, speaking at the VFW, the President made a promise to America's armed forces. \"I will give you a clear mission,\" he said, \"defined goals, and the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That's my commitment to you.\"\n\nIt's time for President Obama to make good on his promise. The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger.\n\nMake no mistake, signals of indecision out of Washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries. Waffling, while our troops on the ground face an emboldened enemy, endangers them and hurts our cause.\n\nRecently, President Obama's advisors have decided that it's easier to blame the Bush Administration than support our troops. This weekend they leveled a charge that cannot go unanswered. The President's chief of staff claimed that the Bush Administration hadn't asked any tough questions about Afghanistan, and he complained that the Obama Administration had to start from scratch to put together a strategy.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, fully aware of the need to meet new challenges being posed by the Taliban, we dug into every aspect of Afghanistan policy, assembling a team that traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan, reviewing options and recommendations, and briefing President-elect Obama's team. They asked us not to announce our findings publicly, and we agreed, giving them the benefit of our work and the benefit of the doubt. The new strategy they embraced in March, with a focus on counterinsurgency and an increase in the numbers of troops, bears a striking resemblance to the strategy we passed to them. They made a decision - a good one, I think - and sent a commander into the field to implement it.\n\nNow they seem to be pulling back and blaming others for their failure to implement the strategy they embraced. It's time for President Obama to do what it takes to win a war he has repeatedly and rightly called a war of necessity.\n\nIt's worth recalling that we were engaged in Afghanistan in the 1980's, supporting the Mujahadeen against the Soviets. That was a successful policy, but then we pretty much put Afghanistan out of our minds. While no one was watching, what followed was a civil war, the takeover by the Taliban, and the rise of bin Laden and al-Qaeda. All of that set in motion the events of 9/11. When we deployed forces eight years ago this month, it was to make sure Afghanistan would never again be a training ground for the killing of Americans. Saving untold thousands of lives is still the business at hand in this fight. And the success of our mission in Afghanistan is not only essential, it is entirely achievable with enough troops and enough political courage.\n\nThen there's the matter of how to handle the terrorists we capture in this ongoing war. Some of them know things that, if shared, can save a good many innocent lives. When we faced that problem in the days and years after 9/11, we made some basic decisions. We understood that organized terrorism is not just a law-enforcement issue, but a strategic threat to the United States.\n\nAt every turn, we understood as well that the safety of the country required collecting information known only to the worst of the terrorists. We had a lot of blind spots - and that's an awful thing, especially in wartime. With many thousands of lives potentially in the balance, we didn't think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all.\n\nThe intelligence professionals who got the answers we needed from terrorists had limited time, limited options, and careful legal guidance. They got the baddest actors we picked up to reveal things they really didn't want to share. In the case of Khalid Sheik Muhammed, by the time it was over he was not was not only talking, he was practically conducting a seminar, complete with chalkboards and charts. It turned out he had a professorial side, and our guys didn't mind at all if classes ran long. At some point, the mastermind of 9/11 became an expansive briefer on the operations and plans of al-Qaeda. It happened in the course of enhanced interrogations. All the evidence, and common sense as well, tells us why he started to talk.\n\nThe debate over intelligence gathering in the seven years after 9/11 involves much more than historical accuracy. What we're really debating are the means and resolve to protect this country over the next few years, and long after that. Terrorists and their state sponsors must be held accountable, and America must remain on the offensive against them. We got it right after 9/11. And our government needs to keep getting it right, year after year, president after president, until the danger is finally overcome.\n\nOur administration always faced its share of criticism, and from some quarters it was always intense. That was especially so in the later years of our term, when the dangers were as serious as ever, but the sense of general alarm after 9/11 was a fading memory. Part of our responsibility, as we saw it, was not to forget the terrible harm that had been done to America \u2026 and not to let 9/11 become the prelude to something much bigger and far worse.\n\nEight years into the effort, one thing we know is that the enemy has spent most of this time on the defensive - and every attempt to strike inside the United States has failed. So you would think that our successors would be going to the intelligence community saying, \"How did you did you do it? What were the keys to preventing another attack over that period of time?\"\n\nInstead, they've chosen a different path entirely - giving in to the angry left, slandering people who did a hard job well, and demagoguing an issue more serious than any other they'll face in these four years. No one knows just where that path will lead, but I can promise you this: There will always be plenty of us willing to stand up for the policies and the people that have kept this country safe.\n\nOn the political left, it will still be asserted that tough interrogations did no good, because this is an article of faith for them, and actual evidence is unwelcome and disregarded. President Obama himself has ruled these methods out, and when he last addressed the subject he filled the air with vague and useless platitudes. His preferred device is to suggest that we could have gotten the same information by other means. We're invited to think so. But this ignores the hard, inconvenient truth that we did try other means and techniques to elicit information from Khalid Sheikh Muhammed and other al-Qaeda operatives, only turning to enhanced techniques when we failed to produce the actionable intelligence we knew they were withholding. In fact, our intelligence professionals, in urgent circumstances with the highest of stakes, obtained specific information, prevented specific attacks, and saved American lives.\n\nIn short, to call enhanced interrogation a program of torture is not only to disregard the program's legal underpinnings and safeguards. Such accusations are a libel against dedicated professionals who acted honorably and well, in our country's name and in our country's cause. What's more, to completely rule out enhanced interrogation in the future, in favor of half-measures, is unwise in the extreme. In the fight against terrorism, there is no middle ground, and half-measures keep you half exposed.\n\nFor all that we've lost in this conflict, the United States has never lost its moral bearings - and least of all can that be said of our armed forces and intelligence personnel. They have done right, they have made our country safer, and a lot of Americans are alive today because of them.\n\nLast January 20th, our successors in office were given the highest honors that the voters of this country can give any two citizens. Along with that, George W. Bush and I handed the new president and vice president both a record of success in the war on terror, and the policies to continue that record and ultimately prevail. We had been the decision makers, but those seven years, four months, and nine days without another 9/11 or worse, were a combined achievement: a credit to all who serve in the defense of America, including some of the finest people I've ever met.\n\nWhat the present administration does with those policies is their call to make, and will become a measure of their own record. But I will tell you straight that I am not encouraged when intelligence officers who acted in the service of this country find themselves hounded with a zeal that should be reserved for America's enemies. And it certainly is not a good sign when the Justice Department is set on a political mission to discredit, disbar, or otherwise persecute the very people who helped protect our nation in the years after 9/11.\n\nThere are policy differences, and then there are affronts that have to be answered every time without equivocation, and this is one of them. We cannot protect this country by putting politics over security, and turning the guns on our own guys.\n\nWe cannot hope to win a war by talking down our country and those who do its hardest work - the men and women of our military and intelligence services. They are, after all, the true keepers of the flame.\n\nThank you very much.", "comment_3": "Press Briefs: Remarks by the President on Strengthening Missile Defense in Europe", "split": "train"}

CDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Galesburg! (Applause.) Well, it\u2019s good to be home in Illinois! (Applause.) It is good to be back. It\u2019s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.\n\n\n\nI want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who\u2019s here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nI see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he\u2019s got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they\u2019ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn\u2019t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.\n\n\n\nDick Durbin couldn\u2019t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He\u2019s doing a great job. And we\u2019ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we\u2019re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd all of you are here, and it\u2019s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn\u2019t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn\u2019t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.\n\n\n\nAnd on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what\u2019s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nSee, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.\n\n\n\nIn the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.\n\n\n\nBut over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.\n\n\n\nAnd so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people\u2019s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\n\n\n\nAnd towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.\n\n\n\nNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we\u2019re off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.\n\n\n\nAnd because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda\u2019s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they\u2019re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they\u2019re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We\u2019re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.\n\n\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.\n\n\n\nBut -- and here's the big \u201cbut\u201d -- I\u2019m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who\u2019ve been out of work for some time.\n\n\n\nToday, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven\u2019t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they\u2019re going to be able to retire.\n\n\n\nSo in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.\n\n\n\nThis growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why reversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It\u2019s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn\u2019t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we\u2019ve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.\n\n\n\nThen, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don\u2019t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks who\u2019ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAlmost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.\n\n\n\nThen, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.\n\n\n\nBut you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won\u2019t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they\u2019ll shift the topic to \u201cout-of-control government spending\u201d \u2013- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nOr they\u2019ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they\u2019ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who\u2019ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they\u2019ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we've been fighting for.\n\n\n\nBut with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.\n\n\n\nThis moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That\u2019s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That\u2019s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need to be talking about. That\u2019s what Washington needs to be focused on.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That\u2019s what we need. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need right now. That\u2019s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, some of these ideas I\u2019ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, of course, we\u2019ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We\u2019ve got to standing up for civil rights. We\u2019ve got to stand up for women\u2019s rights. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo all those issues are important, and we\u2019ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don\u2019t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won\u2019t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won\u2019t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.\n\n\n\nNow, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what\u2019s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\u2019ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can\u2019t act on my own and Congress isn\u2019t cooperating, I\u2019ll pick up the phone -- I\u2019ll call CEOs; I\u2019ll call philanthropists; I\u2019ll call college presidents; I\u2019ll call labor leaders. I\u2019ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future, for all Americans.\n\nSo let me give you a quick preview of what I\u2019ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.\n\n\n\nNow, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I\u2019m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe want to make sure that -- we\u2019re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I\u2019m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let\u2019s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there\u2019s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let\u2019s put some folks to work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we\u2019ve got work to do all across the country. We\u2019ve got ports that aren\u2019t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years\u2019 time. If we don\u2019t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We\u2019ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nBusinesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can\u2019t be outsourced. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, this isn\u2019t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that\u2019s inefficient at a time when it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s been since the 1950s to build things. It\u2019s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nThe longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They\u2019ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we\u2019ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIn an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they\u2019ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they\u2019ll reward those folks with good pay.\n\n\n\nThe days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn\u2019t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they\u2019re not going away. Those old days aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\n\nSo we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That\u2019s what we have to do. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they\u2019re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t make this investment, we\u2019re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don\u2019t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America\u2019s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We\u2019re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn\u2019t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to challenge CEOs from some of America\u2019s best companies to hire more Americans who\u2019ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 an honest look.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that\u2019s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that\u2019s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn\u2019t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That\u2019s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we\u2019re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo this is all a good start -- but it isn\u2019t enough. Families and taxpayers can\u2019t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We\u2019ll never have enough loan money, we\u2019ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We\u2019ve got to get more out of what we pay for.\n\n\n\nNow, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they\u2019re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.\n\n\n\nSo this afternoon, I\u2019ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who\u2019s willing to work for it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, so you\u2019ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that\u2019s your biggest asset. For most families, that\u2019s where your life\u2019s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we\u2019ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn\u2019t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.\n\n\n\nSo already, I\u2019ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney\u2019s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We\u2019ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that\u2019s rock-solid for future generations.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It\u2019s getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.\n\n\n\nNow, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don\u2019t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nGood job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.\n\n\n\nFifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you\u2019ve worked a lifetime to build.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if you\u2019re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don\u2019t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you\u2019d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who\u2019ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act does. That\u2019s what it does. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don\u2019t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don\u2019t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that\u2019s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.\n\n\n\nSo just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today -- 50 percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who\u2019ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you\u2019ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nFinally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I\u2019m going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we\u2019ve never guaranteed success -- that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. That's the American idea. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that\u2019s a betrayal of the American idea. And that\u2019s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.\n\n\n\nThe best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life\u2019s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we\u2019ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\nSo good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that's where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.\n\n\n\nThese are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won\u2019t be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We\u2019ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I\u2019ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I\u2019m going to highlight the ones that do just that.\n\n\n\nThere are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it\u2019s not just good for the employees, it\u2019s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It\u2019s good for America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to be willing to -- we\u2019ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just -- Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we\u2019ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we\u2019ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you\u2019ve said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won\u2019t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I\u2019ll be proposing. I know because they\u2019ve said so. But they worry they\u2019ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.\n\n\n\nNow, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they\u2019re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.\n\n\n\nIn either case, I say to these members of Congress: I\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You can't just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEven if you think I\u2019ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it\u2019s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you\u2019re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s go. If you\u2019ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let\u2019s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you\u2019re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I\u2019m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don\u2019t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we\u2019re older and wiser. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wiser, but I\u2019m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn\u2019t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don\u2019t shut down the government just because I\u2019m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don\u2019t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we\u2019ve already racked up, something that we\u2019ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don\u2019t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, that\u2019s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money\u2019s power will distort our politics even more.\n\n\n\nSocial tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn\u2019t improving. And the fundamental optimism that\u2019s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the vision I have for this country. It\u2019s not the vision you have for this country. That\u2019s not the America we know. That\u2019s not the vision we should be settling for. That\u2019s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.\n\n\n\nI have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019ll tell you, Galesburg, that\u2019s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that\u2019s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we\u2019re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\u2019ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven\u2019t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWhen we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for \u201cnumber one.\u201d Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That\u2019s why we don\u2019t call it John\u2019s dream or Susie\u2019s dream or Barack\u2019s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that\u2019s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we're fighting for.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that\u2019s not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters.\n\n\n\nOne of America\u2019s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, \u201cI speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, America, we\u2019ve made it through the worst of yesterday\u2019s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.\n\n\n\nSo thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge.\n\n\"I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,\" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director \"would tell the president that, in fact, today\u2019s modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person.\"\n\nObama\u2019s exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently , in journalist David Maraniss\u2019 biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang \u2014 friends from Hawaii who frequently got high.\n\nBut has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate.\n\nWhat is THC?\n\nCannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant.\n\nThe level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.\n\nTHC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years.\n\nBut what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent?\n\nThe answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time.\n\nThe University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period.\n\nBack in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss.\n\nFurther, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007.\n\nBut while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn\u2019t likely to increase, ElSohly said.\n\nHow did it get so strong?\n\nThe former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. That\u2019s not quite right.\n\nGenetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substance\u2019s DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market don\u2019t have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications.\n\nHowever, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes.\n\nGenetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost.\n\nCultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC.\n\nThere is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but it\u2019s not widespread yet and it\u2019s not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhat does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Let\u2019s start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency.\n\nNoting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that \"daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\nResearchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned.\n\nThose concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia.\n\nBut for the average adult recreational or habitual user, there\u2019s a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean.\n\nOnly a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level.\n\nIn that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs.\n\nRoger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don\u2019t know everything about its potential impact.\n\nBeyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks.\n\nHospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors.\n\nThis is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling.\n\nOur ruling\n\nKennedy said that marijuana today is \"genetically modified,\" with THC levels that \"far surpass the marijuana\" of the 1970s.\n\nGenerally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obama\u2019s youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuana\u2019s negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedy\u2019s claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from \"genetic modification.\" It\u2019s actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.", "comment_3": "Has the potency of pot changed since President Obama was in high school? @PolitiFact | So have drug war costs. http://t.co/EQO9FlVPVg", "split": "train"}

Click here to connect to part two or part three.\n\n\n\nSen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards answered questions from CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Joe Johns and Suzanne Malveaux in a debate sponsored by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Monday night.\n\nHillary Clinton, left, Barack Obama, center, and John Edwards answer questions on Monday night.\n\nJOE JOHNS, CNN: Senator Clinton, good evening.\n\nThe number-one issue for Americans of both parties is the economy, and today the news is simply not good. Markets around the world are in a tailspin because of fears of a U.S. recession. So far this year, the Dow has lost nearly 9 percent.\n\nHow much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?\n\nSEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Joe, I'm glad you started with the economy, because that is the number-one issue. What's been happening in the markets, what's been happening with the home mortgage crisis, $100-a- barrel oil, so many of the issues that are really at the kitchen tables of Americans today and what they're talking to me about.\n\nWe have to stimulate the economy. I began calling for some kind of economic action plan back at the beginning of December. I have a package of $110 billion; $70 billion of that would go towards dealing with the mortgage crisis, which, unfortunately, I don't think that President Bush has really taken seriously enough.\n\nI would have a moratorium on home foreclosures for 90 days to try to help families work it out so that they don't lose their homes. We're in danger of seeing millions of Americans become basically, you know, homeless and losing the American dream.\n\nI want to have an interest rate freeze for five years, because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, the problem will just get compounded. And we need more transparency in the market.\n\nThen, I think we need to give people about $650, if they qualify -- which will be millions of people -- to help pay their energy bills this winter. You know, there are so many people on fixed incomes and working people who are not going to be able to afford the spike in energy costs.\n\nWe need to make sure that we start jumpstarting the jobs in this country again. That's why I want to put money into clean energy jobs, green-collar jobs, and also make sure we have a fund that will help communities deal with the consequences of the home foreclosure crisis and make sure the unemployment system is up to the task.\n\nAnd then we will have money for rebates, but let's make them the right rebates. Everything we know about President Bush's plans would leave 50 million to 70 million Americans out, because a lot of our seniors on fixed incomes don't pay income taxes. But that doesn't mean they're immune from the energy costs and the health care costs and everything else that's going up around them.\n\nAnd we have a huge number of working people who thankfully don't pay income tax. They pay payroll tax. They pay a lot of other taxes. President Bush's plan would do nothing to help them.\n\nBut thankfully we've got leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus here who are going to make sure that we get the right kind of stimulus. And that's what the Democrats are going to support.\n\nIt's imperative we do it. It's a part of economic justice, which on Dr. King's holiday is part of his unfinished legacy.\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN: All right.\n\nSenator Obama?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA: Well, we do meet on the King holiday. And I think it's important to remember that, in the march on Washington, where Dr. King always talks about -- or it's always repeated, the dream speech that is so famous -- that march was for jobs, as well as justice.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, we have not made the kind of progress that we need in having a balanced economy, and George Bush has made it worse.\n\nGeorge Bush has consistently skewed our tax code to the wealthy. He has squandered billions of dollars in a war that I believe should never have been authorized and should have never been waged.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have not made the investments that are needed in our school system. You travel around South Carolina along the corridor of shame, and you've got children who are going to schools that were built in the 1800s. And they are not able to compete in an international economy.\n\nSo it is absolutely critical right now to give a stimulus to the economy. And Senator Clinton mentioned tax rebates. That wasn't the original focus of her plan. I think recently she has caught up with what I had originally said, which is we've got to get taxes into the -- tax cuts into the pockets of hard-working Americans right away.\n\nAnd it is important for us to make sure that they are not just going to the wealthy. They should be going to folks who are making $75,000 a year or less, and they should be going to folks who only pay payroll tax, but typically are not paying income tax.\n\nIf we do that, then not only can we stimulate the economy, those are the folks who are most likely to spend money right away.\n\nBLITZER: Do you agree with her, $650 is a good number for a tax rebate?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that we are going to have to get some immediate money. What I do is I say, for a typical family, $500 for a tax rebate per family.\n\nBut also, for senior citizens, get a supplement to their Social Security check, because they get that every month. We know exactly how to do it. And that would provide seniors all across the country right away some money to help pay for their heating bills and other expenses that they've got right now.\n\nBLITZER: Correct me if I'm wrong, Senator Edwards. Your plan does not call for a tax rebate, does it?\n\nFORMER SEN. JOHN EDWARDS: No, that's exactly right. Can I start by saying how proud I am to be here tonight, a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus on Dr. King's holiday?\n\nAnd particularly on this night, when we're honoring the legacy of Dr. King, central to his work was the idea of fighting for real equality between the races, fighting to end poverty in America, his famous Poor People's Campaign, which he was engaged in at the time of his death, fighting for garbage workers, actually, in Memphis.\n\nAnd the chasm between the rich and the poor in America is wide. It is getting worse. The rich are get richer. And we've added five million people to the poverty rolls in just over the course of the last seven years, which is...\n\nBLITZER: But what about the stimulus package?\n\nEDWARDS: Here's what we should do. That's why I'm getting to this. What Bush does is he leaves 50 million -- as Hillary pointed out -- 50 million Americans. They're low-income Americans and moderate-income Americans. They are completely left out of the stimulus package.\n\nIf we're actually going to deal with the legacy of Dr. King, if we're going to deal with this issue of poverty -- and I have a comprehensive plan to do that, it is the cause of my life, to end poverty in this country -- we also have to include all Americans in this stimulus plan.\n\nNow, one difference between what I have proposed and what my two colleagues have proposed is I have done something that not only stimulates the economy, but creates long-term benefits, investment in green infrastructure, which creates jobs.\n\nInstead of just getting money out in the short term, this will actually create jobs over the long term, create green infrastructure.\n\nYes, we need to do something about the mortgage crisis. I want to mention one last thing.\n\nThere is one other issue that was mentioned in passing by the two of them, which is the issue of jobs. And there is a difference between myself and my colleagues on this issue of jobs, because they both supported the Peru trade deal.\n\nMy view is the Peru trade deal was similar to NAFTA. And this is crucial to the state of South Carolina...\n\nBLITZER: But...\n\nEDWARDS: ... no, no -- and crucial to the state of the South Carolina and jobs in South Carolina. South Carolina has been devastated by NAFTA and trade deals like NAFTA.\n\nBLITZER: I just want to be precise. What you're proposing are really long-term objectives. In terms of a short-term stimulus package, you disagree with them on an immediate tax rebate.\n\nEDWARDS: No, no. What I'm saying is if we do what we should do to green the economy, if we change our unemployment insurance laws, modernize them to make them available to more people, to more Americans, if we in fact give help to the states, which gets money straight into the economy and we deal with the mortgage crisis in a serious way with a home rescue fund to provide transitional financing for those people who are about to lose their homes, all those things will stimulate the economy.\n\nBLITZER: I'll let both of you respond, but let me let Senator Obama respond first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Let me just respond to a couple of things. I think the idea of bringing jobs is important, which is why that's central to my energy plan. But, Wolf, you're exactly right, that is a long-term agenda. That is not going to deal with the immediate crisis we have right now.\n\nYou've got the European markets dropped 5 percent. The expectation is that the Dow Jones tomorrow may do the same. We could be sliding into an extraordinary recession unless we stimulate the economy immediately. That's point number one.\n\nPoint number two, on trade, John is exactly right that you travel around South Carolina and you see the textile mills that John's father worked in closed, all over the region. And it is absolutely true that NAFTA was a mistake.\n\nI know that Hillary on occasion has said -- just last year said this was a boon to the economy. I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal.\n\nBut the only thing I want to differ on John is this whole notion of Peru. The Peru trade deal had labor and environmental agreements in it. Peru is an economy the size of New Hampshire. Over 90 percent of the goods coming from Peru already come in under various free trade agreements.\n\nAnd, John, you voted for permanent trade relations with China, which I think anybody who looks at how we structure trade in this country would tell you has been the biggest beneficiary and the biggest problem that we have with respect to trade, particularly because they're still manipulating the currency.\n\nBLITZER: I'll let you respond, but, Senator Clinton, I want to get back to the issue of an immediate stimulus for the economy.\n\nCLINTON: That's what I want to get back to.\n\nBLITZER: Because who knows what the markets are going to be like tomorrow and there are a lot of people out there who are suffering already. But go ahead and respond.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I want to just clarify a couple of points. My original plan was $70 billion in spending with a $40 billion contingency that was part of the original plan, in order to have that money available for tax rebates.\n\nI hope that we could do it through spending, and here's why: I don't want to necessarily open up the tax code while we've got Republicans in the Senate who are going to try to come back and open up making Bush's tax cuts permanent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI understand that that's a real risk. So I was hoping to be able to do it through spending, but the crisis has gotten too deep, and what happened in the markets globally today is a huge wakeup call.\n\nThe president should convene the working group on financial markets. He should ask the secretary of treasury to do this immediately. I know that there's been talking going on, but the president's proposed stimulus package is not adequate. It is too little too late and it doesn't give enough money to the people who are hardest hit by the increased costs in energy and everything else.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs a further point, I do believe that the green-collar job piece of this is important. That's why I have $5 billion to do it. There are programs already. Oakland, California, Mayor Dellums is working to have a green-collar job program. We could put hundreds and hundreds of young people to work right now, putting solar panels in, insulating homes.\n\nThat would give them jobs and it would move us more quickly to a green economy. And I think that if you look at this from a jobs and justice, a stimulation and long-term planning effort, we need to lay down the markers now. And that's why the Congress, under the leadership of a lot of the people who are chairs of committees and subcommittees who are here today are going to play a major role in this. And we've got to hold the line against President Bush with his ill-advised approach to stimulating the economy.\n\nBLITZER: All right. We're staying on topic. We're staying on this subject, but I want to ask Suzanne Malveaux to ask a question and then all of you will be able to weigh...\n\nEDWARDS: You have to give me a chance to respond to Senator Obama.\n\nBLITZER: All right, go ahead, respond quickly and then Suzanne.\n\nEDWARDS: Thank you.\n\nWell, first of all, what I have proposed for green-collar jobs will create jobs within 30 or so days, so we will have an immediate impact on the economy and stimulate the economy. Second, no one has to explain to me what these trade deals have done to South Carolina, to North Carolina. My father, who's sitting right out there in the audience, worked in the mills for 36 years and we have seen what these trade deals have done to people who have worked hard all their lives.\n\nEDWARDS: And the problem with Peru, Barack, is you are leaving the enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in the hands of George Bush.\n\nI wouldn't trust George Bush to enforce anything, certainly no trade obligations.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: All right. Ten seconds, go ahead.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Well, the only point I would make is that in a year's time, it'll be me who's enforcing them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd so we're going to make sure that the right thing is being done. And, John, you tell an extraordinarily powerful story. I mean, you understand what's happened with respect to trade here and I think it is powerful when you talk about it.\n\nBut keep in mind, I first moved to Chicago to be a community organizer with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed in that region. And so I spent 3.5 years working alongside folks who had lost their jobs.\n\nAnd I know what it's like for families to have put their life and their heart and soul into a company, building profits for shareholders, and then suddenly they had the rug pulled out from under them. Not only have they lost their job, they've lost their health care, they've lost their pension benefits.\n\nAnd it is absolutely critical for us to understand that NAFTA was an enormous problem. The permanent trade relations with China, without some of the enforcement mechanisms that were in there, that you voted for, was also a significant problem.\n\nAnd we've got to all move forward as Democrats to make sure that we've got trade deals that work for working people and not just for corporate profits.\n\nBLITZER: All right. Suzanne Malveaux, go ahead.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN: I'd like to follow-up with Senator Obama. It was just a few days ago that Senator Clinton asserted that she was the strongest candidate when it comes to fiscal responsibility.\n\nShe says that the new programs that she proposes she essentially can pay for. She says that you have failed in that regard in the tune of some $50 billion worth of new programs that you cannot account for.\n\nHow do you respond to that charge?\n\nOBAMA: What she said wasn't true. We account for every single dollar that we propose.\n\nNow, this, I think, is one of the things that's happened during the course of this campaign, that there's a set of assertions made by Senator Clinton, as well as her husband, that are not factually accurate.\n\nAnd I think that part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody who's going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that we've seen in Washington.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat is something that I hear all across the country. So when Senator Clinton says -- or President Clinton says that I wasn't opposed to the war from the start or says it's a fairytale that I opposed the war, that is simply not true.\n\nWhen Senator Clinton or President Clinton asserts that I said that the Republicans had had better economic policies since 1980, that is not the case.\n\nNow, the viewers aren't concerned with this kind of back-and- forth. What they're concerned about is who's actually going to help the get health care, how are they going to get their kids...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... going to college, and that's the kind of campaign I've tried to run. I think that's the kind of campaign we should all try to run.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I couldn't agree more. But I do think that your record and what you say does matter. And when it comes to...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... a lot of the issues that are important in this race, it is sometimes difficult to understand what Senator Obama has said, because as soon as he is confronted on it, he says that's not what he meant.\n\nThe facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10 to 15 years, and we can give you the exact quote.\n\nNow, I personally think they had ideas, but they were bad ideas. They were bad ideas for America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThey were ideas like privatizing Social Security, like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt.\n\nAnd with respect to putting forth how one would pay for all of the programs that we're proposing in this campaign, I will be more than happy, Barack, to get the information, because we have searched for it.\n\nYou have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid, a very worthy program. There is no evidence from your Web site, from your speeches, as to how you would pay for it.\n\nNow, why is this important? It's important because I think elections are about the future. But how do you determine what will happen in the future? Well, you have to look to the record, you have to look to what we say in campaigns, and what we have done during our careers.\n\nAnd I want to be just very explicit about this. We are not, neither my campaign nor anyone associated with it, are in any way saying you did not oppose the war in Iraq.\n\nCLINTON: You did. You gave a great speech in 2002 opposing the war in Iraq. That was not what the point of our criticism was.\n\nIt was after having given that speech, by the next year the speech was off your Web site. By the next year, you were telling reporters that you agreed with President Bush in his conduct of the war. And by the next year, when you were in the Senate, you were voting to fund the war time after time after time.\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\nCLINTON: So it was more about the distinction between words and action. And I think that is a fair assessment for voters to make.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: OK. Thank you, Senator. Senator, we're a little off topic. I have to let Senator Obama respond, then Senator Edwards, who's going to come...\n\nOBAMA: We're off topic, but...\n\nBLITZER: But go ahead and respond, and then I want to get back to this issue that we're talking about, fiscal responsibility. But go ahead.\n\nOBAMA: Let's talk about it.\n\nHillary, I will be happy to provide you with the information about all -- all the spending that we do. Now, let's talk about Ronald Reagan. What you just repeated here today is...\n\nCLINTON: Barack...\n\nOBAMA: Wait. No. Hillary, you just spoke.\n\nCLINTON: I did not say anything about Ronald Reagan.\n\nOBAMA: You just spoke for two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: You said two things.\n\nOBAMA: You just...\n\nCLINTON: You talked about admiring Ronald Reagan and you talked about the ideas...\n\nOBAMA: Hillary, I'm sorry. You just...\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\nCLINTON: I didn't talk about Reagan.\n\nOBAMA: Hillary, we just had the tape. You just said that I complimented the Republican ideas. That is not true.\n\nWhat I said -- and I will provide you with a quote -- what I said was is that Ronald Reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get Democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda, an agenda that I objected to. Because while I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: I was fighting these fights. I was fighting these fights. So -- but I want to be clear.\n\nSo I want to be clear. What I said had nothing to do with their policies. I spent a lifetime fighting a lifetime against Ronald Reagan's policies. But what I did say is that we have to be thinking in the same transformative way about our Democratic agenda.\n\nWe've got to appeal to Independents and Republicans in order to build a working majority to move an agenda forward. That is what I said.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Now, you can dispute that, but let me finish.\n\nHillary, you went on for two minutes. Let me finish.\n\nThe irony of this is that you provided much more fulsome praise of Ronald Reagan in a book by Tom Brokaw that's being published right now, as did -- as did Bill Clinton in the past. So these are the kinds of political games that we are accustomed to.\n\nCLINTON: Now, wait a minute.\n\nWolf, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just a minute.\n\nBLITZER: Senator Edwards, let them wrap up. Then I'm going to come to you.\n\nYes?\n\nCLINTON: I just want -- I just to clarify -- I want to clarify the record. Wait a minute.\n\nEDWARDS: There's a third person in this debate.\n\nBLITZER: Wait a minute, Senator Edwards. Hold on.\n\nThere has been a specific charge leveled against Hillary Clinton, so she can respond. Then I'll bring in Senator Edwards.\n\nCLINTON: I just want to be sure...\n\nOBAMA: Go ahead and address what you said about...\n\nBLITZER: We have got a long time to. You'll have a good opportunity.\n\nCLINTON: We're just getting warmed up.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Now, I just -- I just want to be clear about this. In an editorial board with the Reno newspaper, you said two different things, because I have read the transcript. You talked about Ronald Reagan being a transformative political leader. I did not mention his name.\n\nOBAMA: Your husband did.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I'm here. He's not. And...\n\nOBAMA: OK. Well, I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I think we both have very passionate and committed spouses who stand up for us. And I'm proud of that.\n\nBut you also talked about the Republicans having ideas over the last 10 to 15 years.\n\nOBAMA: I didn't say they were good ones.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you can read the context of it.\n\nOBAMA: Well, I didn't say they were good ones.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it certainly...\n\nOBAMA: All right, Wolf.\n\nCLINTON: It certainly came across in the way that it was presented, as though the Republicans had been standing up against the conventional wisdom with their ideas. I'm just reacting to the fact, yes, they did have ideas, and they were bad ideas.\n\nOBAMA: I agree.\n\nCLINTON: Bad for America, and I was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Resco, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: No, no, no.\n\nBLITZER: Hold on one second. Hold on.\n\nSenator Edwards -- Senator Edwards has been remarkably patient during this exchange. And I want him -- I don't know if you want to get involved in this, Senator Edwards.\n\nEDWARDS: What I want to say first is, are there three people in this debate, not two?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEDWARDS: And I also want to know -- I also want to know on behalf of voters here in South Carolina, this kind of squabbling, how many children is this going to get health care? How many people are going to get an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this?\n\nEDWARDS: We have got to understand -- you know, and I respect both of my fellow candidates -- but we have got to understand this is not about us personally. It is about...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in.\n\nNow, fiscal responsibility, which I think was the question. It was a little hard to tell there at the end of that. But I think the question was about fiscal responsibility.\n\nI have proposed, I think, the most aggressive, most progressive agenda of the three of us up here. And I was the first to come out with a universal health care plan, first to come out with a global warming plan, first -- and, to the best of my knowledge, only at this point -- to come out with a comprehensive, detailed plan to end poverty in America, since we are on Dr. King's day.\n\nThis is the cause of my life. Everything I have proposed, I have come up with a way to pay for it. And I've been very explicit about how it should be paid for, not abstract, not rhetoric, very, very explicit.\n\nBut I do have to say, in response to something Senator Clinton said just a minute ago, both Senator Obama and I have said Social Security needs a solution. And we have said we won't privatize, we won't cut benefits, we won't raise the retirement age. Same thing that Hillary has said.\n\nBut she has proposed nothing about how we're going to create revenue to keep Social Security alive and talked about fiscal responsibility. Here's the problem: If you don't have -- this is not complicated. The American people understand it. If you've got more money going out than is coming in, you're going to eventually run out of money.\n\nAnd you've got to have a way to pay for it, which is why -- now, let me finish this. Lord knows you let them go on forever.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat I'm saying is we have to be consistent in what we're saying. I have said I think Hillary doesn't want to talk about raising taxes. Let's just be honest about that.\n\nBarack and I have both said that you've got to do something about the cap on Social Security taxes, which is now capped at $97,000. It means if somebody is making $80,000 a year, every dime of their income is taxed for Social Security. But if you are making $50 million a year, only the first $97,000 is taxed.\n\nThat's not right. And people ought to be paying their Social Security taxes. But the American people deserve to know what we're going to do.\n\nWe can disagree. There's nothing wrong with that, so they can make an informed choice, but they at least deserve to know where they stand and what we'd do.\n\nBLITZER: We're staying on the economy, but I want Joe Johns to ask another question so we can continue this dialogue.\n\nJOHNS: All right. Well, Senator Edwards, let's dig a little deeper on the economic mess we're in currently.\n\nIn 2006, a study from the Center for Responsible Lending found that African-Americans are something like 30 percent more likely to be sold a subprime loan than white borrowers with similar credit histories and income.\n\nThe South Carolina NAACP said last month that the American dream for too many Americans, too many African-Americans is a national nightmare. The national NAACP has even filed a class-action lawsuit against 12 nationwide lenders.\n\nSo the bottom-line question really is: Do you believe that lenders have specifically targeted African-Americans? Is this subprime mess really also an issue of race?\n\nEDWARDS: Yes, is the answer. I think they have targeted -- if they haven't been racially motivated, I don't know. There's no way for me to know what's inside their head.\n\nBut what they have done is they have targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families. And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African- American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.\n\nThis is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat history and that legacy has consequences. And the consequence has been that African-American families are more vulnerable. They're more vulnerable to payday lenders. They're more vulnerable to predatory lenders, which is why we desperately need a national law, which I have proposed, which would crack down on these predatory payday lenders.\n\nIt's not enough to do it state-by-state, because these predators just move from place to place to place.\n\nI was in a neighborhood in Cleveland a few months ago, one-block radius, 38 houses under foreclosure, middle-class, African-American neighborhood. These people work. They put everything they had into their homes. And they were about to lose them because these predators have come into the neighborhood and taken everything they have.\n\nSo here are the solutions. Number one, we need a national predatory lending law. Number two, we've got to help low-income families save.\n\nEDWARDS: They have nothing to fall back on. Many have no bank account. They don't deal with financial institutions. We need to teach financial literacy, we need to match what they're able to save so that they actually have something that they can fall back on in case they get in a place where they need more money.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: All right. I want both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama to respond.\n\nBut, briefly, Senator Clinton, your proposal calls for a five- year moratorium on interest rates, 90-day moratorium on foreclosure, five year keeping those interest rates the same. Alan Greenspan suggested that we simply have to let this housing crisis exhaust itself. Trying to prevent the housing markets from going down merely prolongs the agony.\n\nDoes your plan, as he would seem to be suggesting, prolong the agony?\n\nCLINTON: No. I think it helps to mitigate the agony. I mean, what I hear as I go in and out of people's homes and talk to so many who have already lost their homes, they're in foreclosure, they see these interest rates that are about to go up and they know they can't pay them, is that we take action now.\n\nI've been calling for action since last March. When I first started calling for it, a lot of the same economists who now say don't do anything about it said, well, it won't be that bad. We'll be able to weather the crisis.\n\nWell, the fact is, the mortgage crisis is not only destroying the dreams of Americans for home ownership, it is having a ripple effect across the world. So my moratorium for 90 days is a work-out. It's not a bailout. I want people to be able to see whether they can stay in their homes paying a rate that is affordable for them.\n\nAnd the interest rate freeze is I think merited, because look at what's happening -- if you're a big bank that helped get us into this mess, you go borrow money from Abu Dhabi or somewhere. If you're a homeowner who has been at the bottom of this incredible scheme that was established, you're left holding the bag and you don't have the house anymore.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nCLINTON: So I just disagree with those who say don't try to do anything to help the people who need the help right now.\n\nBLITZER: Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: I think that we need to help them. I think it is important to make sure that we're not helping out the speculators, but instead are helping out the homeowners who are actually living in their homes, who have the capacity to make the payments if they're not seeing a huge increase in their mortgage payments.\n\nBut understand this, this is not new. We have a history in this country of preying on low-income peoples because they don't have access to banks. The Community Reinvestment Act is oftentimes not enforced as it should be.\n\nWe've got to open up bank branches. We've got to give people access to financing so that they're not going to a payday loan operation.\n\nI two years ago introduced a provision that would eliminate predatory lending, something that I had already helped to get passed at the state level. But it is important for us to understand that we've got to give ordinary working people access to financing. And it's important to understand that part of the reason that they are borrowing on their homes, they're borrowing on credit cards, is that the banks and financial institutions have dominated policy in Washington.\n\nAnd this is an area where I've got a policy disagreement with Senator Clinton. When we talked a while back, just in the last debate, we talked about the bankruptcy bill, which had been pushed by the banks and the financial institutions, that said, basically, it will be harder for folks who have been lured into these teaser rates and then see their credit cards go up to 30 percent, that they would have a tougher time getting out of bankruptcy.\n\nIn the last debate, Senator Clinton said she voted for it but hoped that it wouldn't pass. Now, I don't understand that approach to legislation. I think it is important for us to stand up to these special interests consistently, all the time, and that's what I've done and that's what I will continue to...\n\nBLITZER: I'm going to go to Suzanne...\n\nCLINTON: Wait, Wolf, I have to answer this.\n\nBLITZER: I'm going to go to Suzanne Malveaux in a second, but I just want to give you a chance, Senator Obama, if you want to respond. Senator Clinton made a serious allegation that you worked for a slumlord. And I wonder if you want to respond.\n\nOBAMA: I'm happy to respond. Here's what happened: I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project. That's what she's referring to.\n\nNow, it's fine for her to throw that out, but the larger reason that I think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say. That is important, because if we can't, then we're not going to be able to mobilize the American people behind bringing about changes in health care reform, bringing about changes in how we're going to put people back to work, changing our trade laws. And consistency matters. Truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd that's what I've tried to do and I will continue to try to do as president of the United States.\n\nCLINTON: Now, let me start with the claim about the bankruptcy bill. I said very clearly I regretted voting for it and I was happy that it didn't get into law.\n\nBy 2005, there was another run at a bankruptcy reform, motivated by the credit card companies and the other big lenders. I opposed that bill. I said very forcefully I opposed that bill.\n\nThere was a particular amendment that I think is very telling. It was an amendment to prohibit credit card companies from charging more than 30 percent interest.\n\nSenator Obama voted for it. I voted against it. It was one of the biggest lobbyist victories on that very bad bill that the bankruptcy bill represented.\n\nAnd I think it's important. You know, if you look at the recent article about Senator Obama's work on health care reform in the Illinois legislature, it's a very interesting piece about how he basically did the bidding of the insurance companies during that effort.\n\nNow, I'm just saying that if we're going to...\n\nOBAMA: That's...\n\nCLINTON: ... be hurling these charges against one another, I'm used to taking the incoming fire. I've taken it for 16 years. But when you get into this arena...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you can't expect to have a hands-off attitude about your record. And it is perfectly fair to have comparisons and contrasts. I voted against a 30 -- I voted for limiting to 30 percent what credit card companies could charge.\n\nSenator Obama did not. That's a fact.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. It is a fact, because I thought 30 percent potentially was too high of a ceiling. So we had had no hearings...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... on that bill. It had not gone through the Banking Committee. I don't know about a lot of folks here, most folks here, if they've got a credit card, are paying 29 percent. So under this provision, that would've been fine.\n\nAnd we had not created the kind of serious...\n\nEDWARDS: You voted against it because the limit was too high, is that what you just said?\n\nOBAMA: That is exactly what I just said, John, because...\n\nEDWARDS: So there's no limit at all.\n\nOBAMA: ... there had been no discussions...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHold on, John. Hold on. Listen to this. There had been no discussion about how we were going to structure this and this was something that had not gone through the committee and we hadn't talked about.\n\nIt didn't make sense for us to cap interest rates...\n\nCLINTON: So you voted with the credit card companies.\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nCLINTON: That's the bottom line.\n\nOBAMA: Hillary, I opposed that bill and you know I did.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well...\n\nOBAMA: And consistently did and unlike you and John who voted for it previously.\n\nBut here's the point. What we have to do is we've got to have consistency in how we vote. You can't say one thing during the campaign trail and then apologize afterward and say it was a mistake, and that has repeatedly happened during the course of this campaign...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and I think that tells you the kind of president that folks are going to be.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you know, Senator Obama, it is very difficult having a straight-up debate with you, because you never take responsibility for any vote, and that has been a pattern.\n\nYou, in the -- now, wait a minute. In the Illinois state legislature...\n\n(AUDIENCE BOOING)\n\nCLINTON: Just a minute. In the Illinois state senate, Senator Obama voted 130 times present. That's not yes, that's not no. That's maybe. And on issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you know, voted present on keeping sex shops away from schools, voted present on limiting the rights of victims of sexual abuse, voted present time and time again.\n\nAnd anytime anyone raises that, there's always some kind of explanation like you just heard about the 30 percent. It's just very difficult to get a straight answer, and that's what we are probing for.\n\nOBAMA: I feel bad for John...\n\nBLITZER (?): I know.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: ... because I know John's not getting a lot of time here.\n\nLet me just respond to this.\n\nBLITZER (?): You can...\n\nOBAMA: I feel pretty bad, I do. I feel pretty bad. But let's just respond to the example that was just thrown out.\n\nThe bill with respect to privacy for victims of sexual abuse is a bill I had actually sponsored, Hillary. I actually sponsored the bill. It got through the senate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat was on the back of 12 other provisions that I was able to pass in the state legislature. Nobody has worked harder than me in the Illinois state legislature to make sure that victims of sexual abuse were dealt with, partly because I've had family members who were victims of sexual abuse and I've got two daughters who I want to protect.\n\nWhat happened on that particular provision was that after I had sponsored it and helped to get it passed, it turned out that there was a legal provision in it that was problematic and needed to be fixed so that it wouldn't be struck down.\n\nBut when you comb my 4,000 votes in Illinois, choose one...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... try to present it in the worst possible light, that does have to be answered. That does have to be answered.\n\nOBAMA: And as I said before, the reason this makes a difference -- and I understand that most viewers want to know, how am I going to get helped in terms of paying my health care? How am I going to get help being able to go to college?\n\nAll those things are important. But what's also important that people are not just willing to say anything to get elected. And...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\nOBAMA: ... that's what I have tried to do in this campaign, is try to maintain a certain credibility.\n\nI don't mind having policy debates with Senator Clinton or Senator Edwards. But what I don't enjoy is spending the week or two weeks or the last month having to answer to these kinds of criticisms that are not factually accurate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: And the press has looked at them. They are not accurate. And you need to present them as accurate.\n\nBLITZER: We're going to be coming back.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that law is still on the books. It was never struck down. That was there.\n\nBLITZER: We're going to be visiting all these subjects, but I just want Senator Edwards to weigh in. Suzanne has got an excellent question coming up.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nEDWARDS: She's been wanting to ask it, too.\n\nCan I just ask, though, before I do -- I mean, I hear the back and forth on this one particular vote, but it is -- I do think it's important, and I mentioned this about Senator Clinton earlier, to be fair, about Social Security. I do think it's important whether you are willing to take hard positions.\n\nI mean, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus who are sitting in front of me right know they have to go to the floor of the House every day and vote on hard issues. And they have to vote up or down or not show up to vote -- one of those three choices. What I didn't hear was an explanation for why over 100 times you voted present instead of yes or no when you had a choice to vote up or down.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: I'll be happy to answer it. Because in Illinois -- in Illinois, oftentimes you vote present in order to indicate that you had problems with a bill that otherwise you might be willing to vote for. And oftentimes you would have a strategy that would help move the thing forward.\n\nKeep in mind, John, I voted for 4,000 bills. And if you want to know whether or not I worked on tough stuff, I passed the first racial...\n\nEDWARDS: I don't question whether you worked on tough stuff.\n\nOBAMA: No, no, no. Hold on a second.\n\nEDWARDS: I don't question whether you worked on tough stuff.\n\nOBAMA: No, no. But you...\n\nEDWARDS: The question is, why would you over 100 times vote present? I mean, every one of us -- every one -- you've criticized Hillary. You've criticized me for our votes.\n\nOBAMA: Right.\n\nEDWARDS: We've cast hundreds and hundreds of votes. What you're criticizing her for, by the way, you've done to us, which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that we've cast.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nEDWARDS: And what -- all I'm saying is, what's fair is fair. You have every right to defend any vote. You do.\n\nOBAMA: Right.\n\nEDWARDS: And I respect your right to do that on any -- on any substantive issue. It does not make sense to me -- and what if I had just not shown up...\n\nOBAMA: John -- John, Illinois...\n\nEDWARDS: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me finish.\n\nOBAMA: Hold on a second.\n\nEDWARDS: What if I had just not shown up to vote on things that really mattered to this country? It would have been safe for me politically. It would have been the careful and cautious thing to do, but I have a responsibility to take a position...\n\nOBAMA: John, you...\n\nEDWARDS: ... even when it has political consequences for me.\n\n(APPLAUSE) consequences. This -- most of these were technical problems with a piece of legislation that ended up getting modified.\n\nBut let's talk about taking on tough votes. I mean, I am somebody who led on reforming a death penalty system that was broken in Illinois, that nobody thought was good politics, but was the right thing to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: I opposed legislation that now is being used against me politically to make sure that juveniles were not put in the criminal justice system as adults, even though it was not the smart thing to do politically. It was not smart for me to oppose the war at the start of this war, but I did so because it was the right thing to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: So I understand that Illinois has a different system than Congress, and that it is fine to try to use that politically. But don't question, John, the fact that on issue after issue that is important to the American people, I haven't simply followed, I have led.

Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3\n\nMcCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0\u2014yes, zero\u2014from the League of Conservation Voters last year.10\n\nJohn McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

It's started at 9 p.m. The Fix team and other Washington Post reporters are using Genius annotations to explain what it all meant.\n\nTo see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\nWOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.\n\nWOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook.\n\nWe also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.\n\nIFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight.\n\nThis is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you're watching -- whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or neither -- because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too.\n\nWith that, let's welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you.\n\nAnd former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nVery good to be here with you.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\nIFILL: Welcome to you both.\n\nWOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.\n\nIFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.\n\nSANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you.\n\nNine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months.\n\nAnd what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.\n\nSANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.\n\nAnd then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.\n\nThey see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them.\n\nI think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nThank you.\n\nIFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n\nSecretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.\n\nI know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.\n\nWe both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.\n\nBut I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.\n\nHardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.\n\nI think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you both.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions.\n\nWOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let's get right to the questions.\n\nSenator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?\n\nSANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.\n\nWhat I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.\n\nI do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.\n\nYeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.\n\nWOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...\n\nSANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.\n\nLast week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.\n\nSANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.\n\nI have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We're not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth.\n\nTwenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.\n\nIn my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.\n\nCLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.\n\nAnd it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.\n\nSo if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.\n\nIFILL: Final thought, Senator.\n\nSANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.\n\nPlease do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.\n\nAnd we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: I'd like to move along. I'd like to move along.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you might -- you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: \"The era of big government is over.\" You may remember that.\n\nWhen asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?\n\nCLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?\n\nIn my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.\n\nI've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I'm aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.\n\nCLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.\n\nIFILL: But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your -- you say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.\n\nAnd I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.\n\nBut I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.\n\nIFILL: Senator?\n\nSANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?\n\nWho denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.\n\nWe need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.\n\nYes, I'm going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.\n\nYes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.\n\nWe bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.\n\nWe differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.\n\nAnd Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Next, we're going to...\n\nSANDERS: A brief response.\n\nWOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.\n\nSANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.\n\nAnd that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.\n\nSo, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign -- you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.\n\nBut in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.\n\nAnd I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I'm going to keep making that case. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.\n\nBut I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women. Do you agree with what she said?\n\nCLINTON: Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for.\n\nAnd when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.\n\nI would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you're in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.\n\n(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.\n\nI am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.\n\nI'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.\n\nCLINTON: I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.\n\nSo I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Final comment.\n\nSANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit.\n\nAll over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.\n\nBut, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.\n\nIf that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you both.\n\nIFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.\n\nThe first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: \"Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?\"\n\nSenator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable.\n\nSo what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.\n\nThe reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.\n\nWe need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.\n\nWhat we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.\n\nThe statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.\n\nHis family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.\n\nCLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.\n\nAnd, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.\n\nBut, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do.\n\nBut, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.\n\nWe will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.\n\n(APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.\n\nSo, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.\n\nWe now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.\n\nBut, we can't rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator Sanders?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.\n\nSo when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.\n\nWOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been?\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.\n\nAnd I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?\n\nSANDERS: White people?\n\nIFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER)\n\nSo many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don't they have a reason to be resentful, Senator -- Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.\n\nAnd that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?\n\nAnd I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.\n\nI particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.\n\nSo, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator -- Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to -- am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.\n\nSANDERS: And here's what the economic issue is.\n\nThe wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.\n\nBut view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.\n\nYou once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They're off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.\n\nWhat have you got now? You are working at McDonald's? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.\n\nAnd that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.\n\nSuicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Thank you.\n\nSenator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.\n\nWould you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?\n\nSANDERS: The answer is yes. We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.\n\nI believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.\n\nAnd in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.\n\nAnd let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those.\n\nBottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I strongly support the president's executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.\n\nI am against the raids. I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.\n\nI'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.\n\nSenator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.\n\nHopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.\n\nIn terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.\n\nSo it wasn't just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.\n\nBut we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.\n\nCLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.\n\nI've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.\n\nAnd with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: I'd like... SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote.\n\nBut in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don't think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.\n\nSo we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we've been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, \"My father\" -- she's a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, \"My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?\"\n\nStart with you, Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.\n\nSANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.\n\nAnd here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.\n\nYes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\nI have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.\n\nSANDERS: In all due respect...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal?\n\nNow, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then.\n\nI would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...\n\nSANDERS: That's my bill. Check it out.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen. I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I'm going to come up with the best way forward. We're going to end up in the same place. We're going to get more revenue. I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: We're going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.\n\nWOODRUFF: You have said that there's no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?\n\nCLINTON: I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions.\n\nLet's talk about our campaigns. I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.\n\nI think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.\n\nThe Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: I'm asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.\n\nSANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy.\n\nWhen extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.\n\nNow, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...\n\nCLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I'm very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.\n\nBut, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It's not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.\n\nI would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.\n\nNow, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's. So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: The people aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWhy does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?\n\nWhy does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that's a major accomplishment.\n\nI agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.\n\nAnd I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate. But let's not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...\n\nSANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That's my view.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we're going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.\n\nIFILL: There's a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.\n\n(BREAK)\n\nWOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders.\n\nSenator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: \"Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?\"\n\nSANDERS: Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.\n\nI believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.\n\nIFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton -- Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.\n\nI would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore. And that's what I intend to do.\n\nSANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America's role in the world.\n\nAmericans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can't win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?\n\nCLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.\n\nSo we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.\n\nWe have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.\n\nAnd we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.\n\nHere at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.\n\nBut the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country.\n\nBut we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It's not only offensive; it's dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.\n\nSo this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.\n\nIFILL: Senator Sanders...\n\nSANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...\n\n... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.\n\nI voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them. And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.\n\nNow I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.\n\nAnd God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.\n\nAnd in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.\n\nBut this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences.\n\nSo I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nHe voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.\n\nI do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.\n\nWhen people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.\n\nAs we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.\n\nI was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.\n\nBut judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it.\n\nBut more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.\n\nSANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.\n\nCLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.\n\nI looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I'm proud that I gave him that advice. And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...\n\nWOODRUFF: Just a final word.\n\nSANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.\n\nSANDERS: Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger. That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: That's fine. That's fine.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.\n\nSANDERS: It is.\n\nCLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.\n\nAnd then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Senator, let me -- let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that's Russia. On the one hand, we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.\n\nWOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead -- that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all -- have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS.\n\nSo my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared -- how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.\n\nSANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.\n\nAs you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable. It is a real horror.\n\nNow, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.\n\nI happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.\n\nSANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.\n\nThe agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.\n\nBut I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.\n\nThis is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.\n\nThis is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.\n\nSo let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.\n\nSo as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Let me just -- just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.\n\nI think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let's hope that it holds.\n\nSANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.\n\nAnd by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.\n\nAnd I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That's how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.\n\nI do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.\n\nYes, they've got to get out of Syria. They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.\n\nI have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It's easier to talk to your friends. It's harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.\n\nNearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.\n\nIf we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.\n\nAnd it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.\n\nWith respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.\n\nAnd we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.\n\nCLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.\n\nSANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.\n\nIt seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about.\n\nSo I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well.\n\nBut I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He's a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, \"The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders -- one American and one foreign -- who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as -- why are they influential?\"\n\nSANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.\n\nAnd then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That's not the role of the government.\n\nAnd when FDR said, \"Yeah, it is,\" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.\n\nAnd kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process. don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.\n\nIn the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.\n\nCLINTON: But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment.\n\nHe wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.\n\nAnd I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: ... who got us out of that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.\n\nSANDERS: That is...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.\n\nAs a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.\n\nSo I have voiced criticisms. You're right. Maybe you haven't. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.\n\nThat's what I said. That is what I believe.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re-election. His first election and his re-election.\n\nBut I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.\n\nAs a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.\n\nIFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to -- you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.\n\nSANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this.\n\nThere is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.\n\nThis campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.\n\nYoung people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. It ain't going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.\n\nSANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\n\nBut here's the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.\n\nAnd here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You're right.\n\nBut if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That's coming up next here on PBS stations and online at PBS.org/NewsHour.\n\nIFILL: I'm going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS.\n\nWOODRUFF: And I'm going to be returning to Washington. I hope you'll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That's it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you.\n\nIFILL: Good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)", "comment_3": "Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated https://t.co/72M80YNoqO", "split": "train"}

The piece was published today in Newsweek.\n\nPresident Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX\n\nBy President Obama\n\nCoaching my daughter Sasha\u2019s basketball team is one of those times when I just get to be \u201cDad.\u201d I snag rebounds, run drills, and have a little fun. More importantly, I get to watch Sasha and her teammates improve together, start thinking like a team, and develop self-confidence.\n\nAny parent knows there are few things more fulfilling than watching your child discover a passion for something. And as a parent, you\u2019ll do anything to make sure he or she grows up believing she can take that ambition as far as she wants; that your child will embrace that quintessentially American idea that she can go as far as her talents will take her.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t so long ago that something like pursuing varsity sports was an unlikely dream for young women in America. Their teams often made do with second-rate facilities, hand-me-down uniforms, and next to no funding.\n\nWhat changed? Well, 40 years ago, committed women from around the country, driven by everyone who said they couldn\u2019t do something, worked with Congress to ban gender discrimination in our public schools. Title IX was the result of their efforts, and this week, we celebrated its 40th anniversary\u201440 years of ensuring equal education, in and out of the classroom, regardless of gender.\n\nI was reminded of this milestone last month, when I awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt. When she started out as a basketball coach, Pat drove the team van to away games. She washed the uniforms in her own washing machine. One night she and her team even camped out in an opponent\u2019s gym because they had no funding for a hotel. But she and her players kept their chins up and their heads in the game. And in 38 years at the University of Tennessee, Pat won eight national championships and tallied more than 1,000 wins\u2014the most by any college coach, man or woman. More important, every single woman who ever played for Pat has either graduated or is on her way to a degree.\n\nToday, thanks in no small part to the confidence and determination they developed through competitive sports and the work ethic they learned with their teammates, girls who play sports are more likely to excel in school. In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men. This is a great accomplishment\u2014not just for one sport or one college or even just for women but for America. And this is what Title IX is all about.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, Title IX isn\u2019t just about sports. From addressing inequality in math and science education to preventing sexual assault on campus to fairly funding athletic programs, Title IX ensures equality for our young people in every aspect of their education. It\u2019s a springboard for success: it\u2019s thanks in part to legislation like Title IX that more women graduate from college prepared to work in a much broader range of fields, including engineering and technology. I\u2019ve said that women will shape the destiny of this country, and I mean it. The more confident, empowered women who enter our boardrooms and courtrooms, legislatures, and hospitals, the stronger we become as a country.\n\nAnd that is what we are seeing today. Women are not just taking a seat at the table or sitting at the head of it, they are creating success on their own terms. The women who grew up with Title IX now pioneer scientific breakthroughs, run thriving businesses, govern states, and, yes, coach varsity teams. Because they do, today\u2019s young women grow up hearing fewer voices that tell them \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d and more voices that tell them \u201cYou can.\u201d\n\nWe have come so far. But there\u2019s so much farther we can go. There are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make. As president, I\u2019ll do my part to keep Title IX strong and vibrant, and maintain our schools as doorways of opportunity so every child has a fair shot at success. And as a dad, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure that this country remains the place where, no matter who you are or what you look like, you can make it if you try.", "comment_3": "Op-ed by President Obama: President Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX | The White House: http://t.co/VqGaZE3M @whitehouse", "split": "train"}

Barack Obama, D-Ill., looks on as he walks along his tour of the National Gypsum plant Sunday, Feb. 24, 2008, in Lorain, Ohio. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nObama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support\n\nLORAIN, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary.\n\nAt the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal \"would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.\"\n\nOne day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words.\n\n\"Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,\" Obama said. \"Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America \u2014 and I never have.\"\n\n\"The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,\" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland.\n\n\"A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, \"I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,\" he said.\n\nThe trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nOhio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nVermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.\n\nOn another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nAsked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, \"The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.\"\n\nHe also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war \"in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed\" or were sent into the war zone without enough training.\n\nPolls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.\n\nGiven that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.\n\nAt the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.\n\nHe said Clinton has \"essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals \"unless they are positive for American workers.\"\n\nTo an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.\n\n\"Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,\" he said. \"But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas.\"", "comment_3": "POLITICS: Obama Hits Clinton On NAFTA Support: Barack Obama accused Democratic presidenti..", "split": "train"}

Pelosi holds weekly news conference \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi holds her weekly news #invest  https://t.co/ybPyjbyf6X", "article": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.\n\n\n\nNoting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.\n\n\n\n\"This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,\" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. \"But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation \u2014 sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) \u2014 to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.\"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\"The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.\"When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It's time for it to be increased again.\"", "comment_3": "Watch Live: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi holds weekly news conference https://t.co/i0WRZ7sqRV via @YouTube", "split": "train"}

The Real Fight Will Be for Crimea http://t.co/FiaRUGYgo7 #opinion", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Forget Kiev -- Real Fight Will Be for Crimea - http://t.co/WdlysgS9rR", "article": "Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.\n\nAs a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading \"Putin is our president\" and \"Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!\" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city \u2014 essentially protecting it \u2014 after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.\n\nNow that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the \"interests of Russians\" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.\n\nI was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as \"Sevastopol\" but makes no mention of \"Ukrainian SSR,\" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.\n\nHowever, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.\n\nSurprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations \u2014 the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.\n\nMy father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.\n\nThe Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.\n\nMany people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.\n\nThe only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.\n\nThere is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.\n\nCrimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.", "comment_3": "Forget #Kiev.

So much so that I felt compelled to bring back our segment where we hold politicians, leaders, and pundits accountable for what comes out of their mouths. It's time now, again, for No Talking Points.\n\n\n\nThe Trayvon Martin murder case got just about everybody talking about race, and not just specifically how it related to the case. It got some, many on the political right, wondering why the so-called liberal media wasn't talking about other problems in the black community.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJUDY MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Let's talk about race. Let's talk about black-on-black violence.\n\n\n\nDAVID WEBB, HOST \"THE DAVID WEBB SHOW\": The outrage that I have is in the lack of really the national attention to what is an epidemic of crime in the black community committed largely by blacks.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: Why aren't we talking about it? Good question. Actually, that's not a good question. We talked about it many times on this show and on CNN. It's actually a good deflection as I've said a number of times to a number of guests here on CNN and also on the radio.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLEMON: David, do not that false equivalent. That is not --\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not trying to equivocate --\n\n\n\nLEMON: But, listen, crime happens all the time and because a crime happens, it does not mean that you should shift the focus from what happened here. Let's stick to this particular point so continue and let's talk about this case.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: On this case --\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: So, that's the reason I didn't want to discuss at length crime in the African-American community or how to fix other ills that seem to be plaguing the community in general. But now that the jury has reached one that everyone must accept it's time now for some tough love on the subject.\n\n\n\nSomeone on another network got the chance to go first because I couldn't go during the week. I'm only here on the weekend, so listen to this --\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African- American family.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: He's got a point. In fact, he's got more than a point. Bill?\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nO'REILLY: Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs. Nobody forces them to do that, again, it is a personal decision.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: He is right about that, too. But in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough. Because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five, and if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you.\n\n\n\nHere's number five. Pull up your pants. Some people, a lot of them black, gave me flak for saying that recently on \"The Wendy Williams Show.\"\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLEMON: If you're sagging, I mean -- I think it's your self-esteem that is sagging and who you are as a person it's sagging. Young people need to be taught respect and there are rules.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLEMON: Sagging pants, whether Justin Bieber or No-name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not OK. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoners so that they can't make a weapon. And then it evolved into which role a prisoner would have during male-on-male prison sex. The one with the really low pants is the submissive one. You get my point?\n\n\n\nNumber four now is the n-word. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJAY-Z, RAPPER: For our generation what we did was we took the word and we took the power out of that word.\n\n\n\nCHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: We took this word, and we made it into poetry.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: I understand poetic license, but consider this: I hosted a special on the n-word, suggesting that black people stop using it and that entertainers stop deluding yourselves or themselves and others that you're somehow taking the word back.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLEMON: By promoting the use of that word when it's not germane to the conversation, have you ever considered that you may be just perpetuating the stereotype the master intended acting like a nigger?\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLEMON: A lot of African-Americans took offense to that, too. I wonder if I gave the right advice, I really did. But confirmation came the very next day on my way home when I exited the subway in 125th Street in Harlem. This little kid in a school uniform no older than seven years old, he was crying his eyes out as he walked down the sidewalk with his mother.\n\n\n\nI'm going to be honest here, she turned to me, and she said \"I'm sick of you. You act like an old ass man, stop all that crying, nigger.\" Is that taking the word back? Think about that.\n\n\n\nNow number three. Respect where you live. Start small by not dropping trash, littering in your own communities. I've lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life, I rarely, if ever, witnessed people littering. I live in Harlem now, it's an historically black neighborhood, every single day I see adults and children dropping their trash on the ground when a garbage can is just feet away. Just being honest here.\n\n\n\nNumber two, finish school. You want to break the cycle of poverty? Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money.\n\n\n\nAnd number one, and probably the most important, just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should. Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues. So, please, black folks, as I said if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior. Pay close attention to the hip-hop and rap culture that many of you embrace. A culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you. And it's not going to. That said, though, the political right is not off the hook.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKRISTEN POWERS, DAILY BEAST COLUMNIST: If conservatives are so concerned about black-on-black crime, it's a little concerning the only time I hear them talking about it is when they want to stick it to the black community.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nLEMON: And that's today's \"No Talking Points.\"", "comment_3": "President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on North Korea aren\u2019t the only thing spinning Leftmedia heads.

If we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponent\u2019s patriotism to win an election, then the American people will lose. The times are too serious for this kind of politics. The calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great. So let me begin by offering my judgment about what we\u2019ve done, where we are, and where we need to go. Six years ago, I stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in Iraq, and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Senator McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that \u2013 as despicable as Saddam Hussein was \u2013 posed no imminent threat to the American people. Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al Qaeda\u2019s leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America\u2019s focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region. In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, I warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the Middle East, create new centers of terrorism, and tie us down in a costly and open-ended occupation. Senator McCain predicted that we\u2019d be greeted as liberators, and that the Iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues. For the good of our country, I wish he had been right, and I had been wrong. But that\u2019s not what history shows. Senator McCain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors, his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge. Let me once again praise General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker \u2013 they are outstanding Americans. In Iraq, gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military, the increasing capability of Iraq\u2019s Security Forces, the ceasefire of Shiite militias, and the decision taken by Sunni tribes to take the fight to al Qaeda. Those are the facts, and all Americans welcome them. But understand what the essential argument was about. Before the surge, I argued that the long-term solution in Iraq is political \u2013 the Iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future. That holds true today. We have lost over a thousand American lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars since the surge began, but Iraq\u2019s leaders still haven\u2019t made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country. Our military is badly overstretched \u2013 a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world. And while we pay a heavy price in Iraq \u2013 and Americans pay record prices at the pump \u2013 Iraq\u2019s government is sitting on a $79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits. Let\u2019s be clear: our troops have completed every mission they\u2019ve been given. They have created the space for political reconciliation. Now it must be filled by an Iraqi government that reconciles its differences and spends its oil profits to meet the needs of its people. Iraqi inaction threatens the progress we\u2019ve made and creates an opening for Iran and the \u201cspecial groups\u201d it supports. It\u2019s time to press the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. The best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades, carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground. We can safely redeploy at a pace that removes our combat brigades in 16 months. That would be well into 2010 \u2013 seven years after the war began. After this redeployment, we\u2019ll keep a residual force to target remnants of al Qaeda; to protect our service members and diplomats; and to train Iraq's Security Forces if the Iraqis make political progress. Iraq\u2019s democratically-elected Prime Minister has embraced this timeframe. Now it\u2019s time to succeed in Iraq by turning Iraq over to its sovereign government. We should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched. We should not keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq while Americans struggle in a sluggish economy. Ending the war will allow us to invest in America, to strengthen our military, and to finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and the border region of Pakistan. This is the central front in the war on terrorism. This is where the Taliban is gaining strength and launching new attacks, including one that just took the life of ten French soldiers. This is where Osama bin Laden and the same terrorists who killed nearly 3,000 Americans on our own soil are hiding and plotting seven years after 9/11. This is a war that we have to win. And as Commander-in-Chief, I will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten America, and finishing the job against the Taliban. For years, I have called for more resources and more troops to finish the fight in Afghanistan. With his overwhelming focus on Iraq, Senator McCain argued that we could just \u201cmuddle through\u201d in Afghanistan, and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month. Now, we need a policy of \u201cmore for more\u201d \u2013 more from America and our NATO allies, and more from the Afghan government. That's why I've called for at least two additional U.S. combat brigades and an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance for Afghanistan, with a demand for more action from the Afghan government to take on corruption and counternarcotics, and to improve the lives of the Afghan people. We must also recognize that we cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure America as long as there is a terrorist safe-haven in northwest Pakistan. A year ago, I said that we must take action against bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and Pakistan cannot or will not act. Senator McCain criticized me and claimed that I was for \u201cbombing our ally.\u201d So for all of his talk about following Osama bin Laden to the Gates of Hell, Senator McCain refused to join my call to take out bin Laden across the Afghan border. Instead, he spent years backing a dictator in Pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people. I argued for years that we need to move from a \u201cMusharraf policy\u201d to a \u201cPakistan policy.\u201d We must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man. Now, with President Musharraf\u2019s resignation, we have the opportunity to do just that. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve cosponsored a bill to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al Qaeda in the tribal regions of Pakistan. Today, our attention is also on the Republic of Georgia, and Senator McCain and I both strongly support the people of Georgia and the Americans delivering humanitarian aid. There is no possible justification for Russia\u2019s actions. Russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease-fire signed by their president, and we are hearing reports of Russian atrocities: burning wheat fields, brutal killing, and the destruction of Georgia\u2019s infrastructure and military assets. This crisis underscores the need for engaged U.S. leadership in the world. We failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted, our resources overstretched, and our alliances frayed. American leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that we\u2019re not merely responding to them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to renewing our leadership and rebuilding our alliances as President of the United States. For months, I have called for active international engagement to resolve the disputes over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. I made it crystal clear before, at the beginning of, and during this conflict that Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity must be respected, and that Georgia should be integrated into transatlantic institutions. I have condemned Russian aggression, and today I reiterate my demand that Russia abide by the cease-fire. Russia must know that its actions will have consequences. They will imperil the Civil Nuclear Agreement, and Russia\u2019s standing in the international community \u2013 including the NATO-Russia Council, and Russia\u2019s desire to participate in organizations like the WTO and the OECD. Finally, we must help Georgia rebuild what has been destroyed. That is why I\u2019m proud to join my friend, Senator Joe Biden, in calling for an additional $1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of Georgia. These are the judgments I\u2019ve made and the policies that we have to debate, because we do have differences in this election. But one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people can\u2019t disagree without challenging each other\u2019s character and patriotism. I have never suggested that Senator McCain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition. I have not suggested it because I believe that he genuinely wants to serve America\u2019s national interest. Now, it\u2019s time for him to acknowledge that I want to do the same. Let me be clear: I will let no one question my love of this country. I love America, so do you, and so does John McCain. When I look out at this audience, I see people of different political views. You are Democrats and Republicans and Independents. But you all served together, and fought together, and bled together under the same proud flag. You did not serve a Red America or a Blue America \u2013 you served the United States of America. So let\u2019s have a serious debate, and let\u2019s debate our disagreements on the merits of policy \u2013 not personal attacks. And no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run, I will honor Senator McCain\u2019s service, just like I honor the service of every veteran in this room, and every American who has worn the uniform of the United States. One of those Americans was my grandfather, Stanley Dunham. My father left when I was 2, so my grandfather was the man who helped raise me. He grew up in El Dorado, Kansas \u2013 a town too small to warrant boldface on a road map. He worked on oil rigs and drifted from town to town during the Depression. Then he met my grandmother and enlisted after Pearl Harbor. He would go on to march across Europe in Patton\u2019s Army, while my great uncle fought with the 89th Infantry Division to liberate Buchenwald, my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line, and my mother was born at Fort Leavenworth. After my grandfather left the Army, he went to college on the GI Bill, bought his home with help from the Federal Housing Authority, and he and my grandmother moved west in a restless pursuit of their dreams. They were among the men and women of our Greatest Generation. They came from ordinary places, and went on to do extraordinary things. They survived a Depression and faced down fascism. And when the guns fell silent, America stood by them, because they had a government that didn\u2019t just ask them to win a war \u2013 it helped them to live their dreams in peace, and to become the backbone of the largest middle class that the world has ever known. In the five years after World War II, the GI Bill helped 15 million veterans get an education. Two million went to college. Millions more learned a trade in factories or on farms. Four million veterans received help in buying a home, leading to the biggest home construction boom in our history. And these veterans didn\u2019t just receive a hand from Washington \u2013 they did their part to lift up America, just as they\u2019d done their duty in defending it. They became teachers and doctors, cops and firefighters who were the foundation of our communities. They became the innovators and small business owners who helped drive the American economy. They became the scientists and engineers who helped us win the space race against the Soviets. They won a Cold War, and left a legacy to their children and grandchildren who reached new horizons of opportunity. I am a part of that legacy. Without it, I would not be standing on this stage today. And as President, I will do everything that I can to keep the promise, to advance the American Dream for all our veterans, and to enlist them in the cause of building a stronger America. Our young men and women in uniform have proven that they are the equal of the Greatest Generation on the battlefield. Now, we must ensure that our brave troops serving abroad today become the backbone of our middle class at home tomorrow. Those who fight to defend America abroad must have the chance to live their dreams at home \u2013 through education and their ability to make a good living; through affordable health care; and through a retirement that is dignified and secure. That is the promise that we must keep with all who serve. It starts with those who choose to remain in uniform, as well as their families. My wife Michelle has net with military families in North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia over the last several months. Every time, she passes on their stories \u2013 stories of lives filled with patriotism and purpose, but also stories of spouses struggling to pay the bills, kids dealing with an absent parent, and the unique burden of multiple deployments. The message that Michelle has heard is what you all know and have lived: when a loved one is deployed, the whole family goes to war. The VFW has done an extraordinary job of standing by our military families \u2013 helping out with everything from a phone card for a soldier who is overseas, to an extra hand around the house. As President, I will stand with you. We need a Military Families Advisory Board to identify new ways to ease the burden. We need more official support for the volunteer networks that help military spouses get by. And we need to make sure that military pay does not lag behind the private sector, so that those who serve can raise their families and live the life they\u2019ve earned. For those who return to civilian life, I will support their American Dream in this 21st century just as we supported generations of veterans in the 20th. That starts with education. Everyone who serves this country should have the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the GI Bill. That\u2019s why, unlike my opponent, I was a strong and early supporter of Jim Webb\u2019s GI Bill for the 21st Century \u2013 a bill that Senator McCain called too generous. At a time when the skyrocketing cost of tuition is pricing thousands of Americans out of a college education, this bill provides every veteran with a real chance to afford a world-class college education. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to stand up for as President. We must also stand up for affordable health care for every single veteran. That's why I've pledged to build a 21st century VA. We need to cut through the red tape \u2013 every service-member should get electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge. We need to close shortfalls \u2013 it\u2019s time to fully fund VA health care, and to add more Vet Centers. We need to get rid of means-testing - every veteran should be allowed into the VA system. My opponent takes a different view. He wants to ration care so the VA only serves combat injuries, while everyone else gets an insurance card. While the VA needs some real reform to better serve those who have worn the uniform, privatization is just not the answer. We cannot risk our veterans\u2019 health care by turning the VA into just another health insurer. We need to make sure the VA is strong enough to treat every veteran who depends on it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as President. And we must expand and enhance our ability to identify and treat PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury at all levels: from enlistment, to deployment, to civilian life. No one should suffer in silence, or slip through the cracks in the system. That's why I've passed measures to increase screening for these unseen wounds, and helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from them. This is something I\u2019ve fought for in the Senate, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ll make a priority as President. Economic security for our veterans also depends on revamping an overburdened benefits system. I congratulate the VFW for what you\u2019ve done to help veterans navigate a broken VBA bureaucracy. Now it\u2019s time for the government to do a better job. We need more workers, and a 21st century electronic system that is fully linked up to military records and the VA\u2019s health network. It\u2019s time to ensure that those who\u2019ve served get the benefits that they\u2019ve earned. Just as we give veterans the support they deserve, we must also engage them and all Americans in a new cause: renewing America. I am running for President because I believe that there is no challenge too great for the American people to meet if they are called upon to come together. In America, each of us is free to seek our dreams, but we must also serve a common purpose, a higher purpose. No one embodies that commitment like a veteran. Just think of the skills that our troops have developed through their service. They have not simply waged war in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 they have rebuilt infrastructure, supported new agriculture, trained police forces, and developed health care systems. For those leaving military service, it\u2019s time to apply those skills to our great national challenges here at home. That means expanding programs like Troops-to-Teachers that put veterans at the front of the classroom. That means tapping the talent of engineers who\u2019ve served as we make a substantial investment to rebuild our infrastructure and create millions of new jobs. That means dramatically expanding national service programs to give Americans of all ages, skills and stations the chance to give back to their communities and their country. I\u2019ll also enlist veterans in forging a new American energy economy. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a Green Veterans initiative to give our veterans the training they need to succeed in the Green Jobs of the future \u2013 so that they put themselves on a pathway to a successful career, while ensuring that our national security is never held hostage to hostile nations. This is how we can help our veterans live their dreams while helping our country meet the challenges of the 21st century. And this is what we have learned from so many generations of veterans, including those of you here today \u2013 that your contribution to the American story does not end when the uniform comes off. We need those who serve in our military to live their dreams \u2013 and to continue serving the cause of America \u2013 when the guns fall silent. That\u2019s what the VFW stands for, and if I have the honor of being your President, that\u2019s what my Administration will work for every single day. Because I believe that we have a sacred trust with those who serve in our military. That trust is simple: America will be there for you just as you have been there for America. It\u2019s a trust that begins at enlistment, and it never ends. I thought of that trust last week when I visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial. I saw where the bombs fell on the USS Arizona, and where a war began that would reshape the world order while reshaping the lives of all who served in it \u2013 from our great generals and admirals, to the enlisted men like my grandfather. Then I visited his grave at the Punchbowl, the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. I still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest. In a cemetery lined with the graves of Americans who have sacrificed for our country, we heard the solemn notes of Taps and the crack of guns fired in salute; we watched as a folded flag was handed to my grandmother and my grandfather was laid to rest. It was a nation's final act of service and gratitude to Stanley Dunham - an America that stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform, and never left his side. This is what we owe our troops and our veterans. Because in every note of Taps and in every folded flag, we hear and see an unwavering belief in the idea of America. The idea that no matter where you come from, or what you look like, or who your parents are, this is a place where anything is possible; where anyone can make it; where we look out for each other, and take care of each other; where we rise and fall as one nation - as one people. It's an idea that's worth fighting for - an idea for which so many Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. Now it falls to us to advance that idea just as so many generations have before.\n\n", "comment_3": "d: The Long Run - Response to 9/11 Offers Outline of McCain Doctrine - Series - NYTimes.com http://tinyurl.com/3hybdo", "split": "train"}

You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.\n\nAnd I believe it's a new partnership -- a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio?\n\nRUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.\n\nRUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.\n\nThis election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before -- 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old -- never voted before.\n\nWe're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.\n\nWe're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nLet's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in -- on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls \"disastrous trade deals\" in order to bring jobs back to America.\n\nGovernor Kasich, I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?\n\nKASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.\n\nBut my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"Oh, America was right,\" and people are out of work.\n\nThe fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.\n\nBut we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.\n\nTrade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.\n\nAnd Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.\n\nWhy should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.\n\nSo I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, \"generally very much in favor of free trade.\" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?\n\nRUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.\n\nThe problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.\n\nThere are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.\n\nOn the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\n\nCRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.\n\nAnd the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.\n\nAnd you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.\n\nNumber one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?\n\nRUBIO: If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.\n\nThe second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire -- Disney or some other company hires this company.\n\nWhat they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.\n\nIt is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou've -- in the -- in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.\n\nRUBIO: Correct.\n\nDINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.\n\nRUBIO: Well first, I think -- well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.\n\nIf there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not -- what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.\n\nThey are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \"lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?\n\nKAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.\n\nImmigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we -- I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.\n\nI would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.\n\nAnd I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nWe can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\n\nTRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\n\nWhen it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of -- and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.\n\nAnd I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.\n\nWe have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just -- we're leading with the chin.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWe're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\n\nDINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.\n\nAnd the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.\n\nWe're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.\n\nThe Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.\n\nCRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.\n\nThe problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.\n\nBut today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.\n\nMr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?\n\nTRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.\n\nAnd it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.\n\nSo there are a lot of things. But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.\n\nTAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say \"education by Washington, D.C.,\" what do you mean?\n\nTRUMP: You're right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.\n\nNow in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?\n\nKASICH: Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.\n\nSecondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.\n\nNot only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.\n\nNow on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.\n\nWe need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.\n\nFrankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.\n\nSo let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What's wrong with that?\n\nCRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.\n\nNow, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBeyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.\n\nAnd let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child -- African American, Hispanic -- every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.\n\nLet me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \"We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\" they're not being honest with you.\n\nSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.\n\nFor example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIf I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.\n\nThese are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.\n\nBut again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.\n\nThat's -- all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.\n\nAnd that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.\n\nI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.\n\nTRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.\n\nYou have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...\n\nI mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a -- it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.\n\nWe've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?\n\nTRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take -- every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.\n\nWe have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?\n\nRUBIO: No. And I -- and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.\n\nFraud is not enough. Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don't add up.\n\nThe bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.\n\nAnd here's the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It's barely been asked in any of these debates. And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up. What's your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it. I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don't bid things out. We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don't go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That's what they're paying.\n\nAnd the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don't bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?\n\nI'm self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don't want anybody's money. I will tell you something. We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We're going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?\n\nCRUZ: Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible. And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.\n\nIt's like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Here's my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.\n\nBASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?\n\nCRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can't take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nIf we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you Senator Cruz.\n\nMr. Trump, would you like to respond?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and -- at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.\n\nBASH: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.\n\nWhen I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... against Washington. And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?\n\nBASH: OK. Mr. Trump, I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there's no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.\n\nAnd there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, \"Get over cuts to Social Security benefits\" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?\n\nKASICH: Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.\n\nI also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.\n\nKASICH: I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.\n\nIf you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. That's the way it will work. And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I've done all this before.\n\nThis is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn't mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.\n\nSo not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We're up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.\n\nAnd I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nLet's take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.\n\nHow are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.\n\nYou look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.\n\nYou look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that's that.\n\nBut I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.\n\nIf you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.\n\nAnd if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: ... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision?\n\nCRUZ: Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.\n\nNow he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don't know where he'll be tonight. But I'll tell you what happens. You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.\n\nAnd the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.\n\nA much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond.\n\nTRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don't behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can't. China won't let them. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.\n\nChina dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can't get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.\n\nThe 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz?\n\nCRUZ: Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It's not China that pays the tax. It's you, the working men and women.\n\nSo ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, \"I'm going to jack -- I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.\" That hurts you.\n\nIt's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\nTRUMP: Jake, I have to say -- honestly, it's just the opposite. What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we'll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.\n\nSo we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products. And that's the way it should be done. And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country -- our country is in serious, serious trouble. It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.\n\nTAPPER: All right. We're going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, \"Islam hates us?\" Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.\n\nTRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.\n\nDINAN: Do you want to clarify the comment at all?\n\nTRUMP: Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today. And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry -- Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree?\n\nRUBIO: Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It's a very tough place to be a missionary. It's Muslim.\n\nAnd their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.\n\nI can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be.\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems.\n\nNow you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don't want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nNow I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.\n\nDINAN: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: We better solve the problem before it's too late.\n\nDINAN: Senator Rubio?\n\n(APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Well, here we go. See, I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line. We do work. There is -- Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.\n\nThere is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other -- with Muslims, who do not -- who are not radicals. We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.\n\nWe're going to have to work with the Saudis. We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.\n\n(BELL RING)\n\nRUBIO: It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.\n\nAnd so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?\n\nKASICH: No, I don't. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn't any question. And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states.\n\nAnd we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just -- they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.\n\nLook, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view. But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\nMr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, \"take out\" the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, \"So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?\"\n\nIt is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?\n\nTRUMP: Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting \"death to the USA.\" Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.\n\nAs far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law -- this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we're working on a different set of parameters.\n\nNow, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.\n\nWe better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\nRUBIO: No, of course not. And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It's difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They're going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.\n\nAnd then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because -- because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.\n\nWe are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.\n\n(APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\nCRUZ: No, of course not. We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening.\n\nBut the answer is not simply to yell, \"China bad, Muslims bad.\" You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.\n\nCRUZ: And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's a mistake.\n\nThe Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I'll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nAs president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Thank you Senator Cruz.\n\nMr. Trump. we're going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, \"sort of a neutral guy\". He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.\n\nHe was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am. OK. There's nobody.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: I am pro-Israel.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nTRUMP: I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I've made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of -- I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is -- I'm a negotiator. If I go in, I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.\n\nBut I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.\n\nHEWITT: Senator Trump...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen. I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.\n\nCRUZ: You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region.\n\nWe get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.\n\nThey pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad.\n\nLet me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\n\nCRUZ: He's hunting them down and stomping them.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you.\n\nCRUZ: Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.\n\nHEWITT: I want to go back to the Israeli government's assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree.\n\nRUBIO: Well, that's undeniable. First of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so. And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.\n\nBut let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn't.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: Because there's no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that's what will happen again.\n\nThese groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nSo maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, and then I'll come to you Senator Kasich.\n\nRUBIO: And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich.\n\nTRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.\n\nBut I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.\n\nAnd some believe it's possible. It may not be, in which case we'll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.\n\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence?\n\nKASICH: Well, there's no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?\n\nSecondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground.\n\nAnd I just have to tell you this, I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix -- to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq.\n\nFrom the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?\n\nCRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We're not using our overwhelming air power. We're not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.\n\nBut, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.\n\nThey're not able to fight. They're not able to defend themselves. They're not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?\n\nKASICH: Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years.\n\nWe absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer -- is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.\n\nAnd you bring all the force you need. It has got to be \"shock and awe\" in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, more troops? TRUMP: We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.\n\nHEWITT: How many...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we're not allowed to fight. We can't fight. We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.\n\nI mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we're kidding. They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint. We don't fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don't even know what we're doing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nLet's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.\n\nSenator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.\n\nWhat specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He's struggling with the V.A.\n\nThe other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, \"Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.\" Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen -- one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.\n\nPeople need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit -- Bernie Sanders was a part of this -- we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.\n\nSenior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working. The problem is no one's being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one's been disciplined. No one's been demoted.\n\nWhen I'm president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. (APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\nShould veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?\n\nKASICH: I don't -- I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.\n\nNumber two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.\n\nAnd secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.\n\nAnd when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.\n\nTwo of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made -- after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.\n\nIt will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.\n\nThere has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.\n\nAnd we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.\n\nHe asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't really agree with President Obama. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making -- as usual with our country, we don't make good deal. We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.\n\nAs an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.\n\nAll that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don't want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be -- should take place. After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.\n\nThis was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?\n\nTRUMP: I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor. It the same way as the Iran deal.\n\nWe never walked -- we never -- all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give.\n\nBASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana.\n\nTRUMP: I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. (APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It's the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don't have to close it that way. Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose.\n\n(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)\n\nThird, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified. Here's a good deal -- Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That's a good deal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?\n\nCRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\n\nThere's a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.\n\nBASH: Senator Cruz, your response?\n\nCRUZ: Well, look. I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.\n\nCRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don't just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.\n\nWe need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don't come back early -- three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way. If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate. They come back early.\n\nWhat you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster.\n\nTed, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.\n\nBASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let's refocus this back on Cuba.\n\nGovernor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?\n\nKASICH: No, I wouldn't. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.\n\nYou won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.\n\nAnd then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake.\n\nYou need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: ... and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don't own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.\n\nWe will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.\n\nAnd a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nWhen I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.\n\nMayor Regalado told me, quote, \"Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?\" Unquote.\n\nSenator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?\n\nRUBIO: Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: There's never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?\n\nSo on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.\n\nAnd I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.\n\nLet me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.\n\nRUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.\n\nAnd you know what passing those laws would have -- what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.\n\nTAPPER: So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.\n\nWhen you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?\n\nRUBIO: I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass -- if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.\n\nOne, because America is not a planet. It's a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here's what he will immediately -- and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend -- but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.\n\nHe will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami? KASICH: Well, I -- I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both.\n\nIn our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.\n\nAnd you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.\n\nNow, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.\n\nSo the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nSenator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, \"foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed.\" Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?\n\nCRUZ: Of course it does. And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.\n\nThen he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, \"it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us.\"\n\nAnd that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.\n\nIt's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said: \"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\"\n\nHow do you respond...\n\nTRUMP: That doesn't mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.\n\nAs far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin.\n\nTAPPER: But the word strong obviously is a compliment...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: ... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.\n\nTRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think?\n\nKASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front -- that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.\n\nNumber two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.\n\nAnd they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will.\n\nAnd when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.\n\nWe're going to take another quick break. When we come back, we'll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.\n\nMr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.\n\nToday, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, \"this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.\" Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?\n\nTRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people -- you've seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest -- in some cases -- you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like. But when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable. They have anger.\n\nThey love this country. They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know -- I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: Some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates -- at these rallies including February 23rd, \"I'd like to punch him in the face,\" referring to a protesters. February 27th, \"in the good ol' days, they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\" February 1st, \"knock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\"\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind. But doing serious damage. And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.\n\nAnd it's not me. It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It's usually the police -- and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo we should pay -- we should truly give our police. They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?\n\nCRUZ: Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for. You know, we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people.\n\nAnd let me -- let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Washington isn't listening to the people. And that's the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald's rallies recently, he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.\n\nNow, I got to say to me, I think that's exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.\n\nTAPPER: Thank you senator.\n\nMr. Trump, if you'd like to respond.\n\nTRUMP: It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having -- on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you're going to vote for Donald Trump?\n\nEveryone's laughing, we're all having a good time. That's why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: But we're all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show ", "comment_3": "The CNN Miami Republican debate transcript, annotated:    Donald Trump, Sen.

He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile\u2019s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile\u2019s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile\u2019s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video \u201cis pretty horrific,\u201d said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. \u201cThere are things we don\u2019t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases \u2014 whether explicit or implicit \u2014 about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.\u201d\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile\u2019s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son \u201cwas just black in the wrong place.\u201d Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n\u201cPolice understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,\u201d said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can\u2019t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n\u201cWhen people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,\u201d said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. \u201cThat counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.\u201d\n\nLast year, the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n\u201cOur implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we\u2019re facing ambiguous situations,\u201d Fridell said. \u201cA person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren\u2019t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.\n\n\n\nRyan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.\n\n\n\nToday, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.\n\n\n\nRyan\u2019s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called \"premium support.\")\n\n\n\nThough House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan\u2019s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.\n\n\n\nThe Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut \"$700 billion\" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!\n\n\n\nFor this check, we\u2019re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.\n\n\n\n\"You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,\" Cutter said. \"You know what those cuts are? It\u2019s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to digest if you\u2019re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them \"cuts\" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.\n\n\n\n$700 billion in Medicare cuts?\n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?\n\n\n\nWell, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally \"cut\" a dollar from the Medicare program\u2019s budget.\n\n\n\nRather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.\n\n\n\nHospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\n\n\n\nStill, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would \"cut\" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we\u2019ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.\n\n\n\nBecause Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law\u2019s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.\n\n\n\nThe CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s timing that\u2019s making the \"cuts\" bigger, not changes to Medicare.\n\n\n\nDoes the Ryan budget \u2018protect those cuts\u2019?\n\n\n\nNow onto our second question: Does Ryan\u2019s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney\u2019s running mate:\n\n\n\nStephanopoulos: \"You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.\n\n\n\nRyan: \"Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ...\" (Read the full exchange.)\n\n\n\nSo Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.\n\n\n\nThe Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter\u2019s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.\n\n\n\n\"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama\u2019s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\" said Lanhee Chen, Romney\u2019s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. \"A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.\"\n\n\n\nCutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn\u2019t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn\u2019t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n\nStill, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nCutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but \"Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.\n\nCutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney\u2019s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.\n\n\n\nStill, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.", "comment_3": "CBO: The Long-Term Budgetary Impact of Paths for Federal Revenues and Spending Specified by Chairman Ryan http://t.co/v1w7qdJW", "split": "train"}

{"comment_2": "Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States https://t.co/cGZlIdWDfC via @BernieSanders", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States https://t.co/ssBkJXvjxL", "article": "Prepared Remarks Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States November 19, 2015 Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail Link\n\nIn his inaugural remarks in January 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and this is what he saw.\n\nHe saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life.\n\nHe saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day.\n\nHe saw millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.\n\nHe saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty and lack of disposable income denying employment to many other millions.\n\nHe saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\n\nAnd he acted. Against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists, Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government. He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country. He combatted cynicism, fear and despair. He reinvigorated democracy. He transformed the country.\n\nAnd that is what we have to do today.\n\nAnd, by the way, almost everything he proposed was called \u201csocialist.\u201d Social Security, which transformed life for the elderly in this country was \u201csocialist.\u201d The concept of the \u201cminimum wage\u201d was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as \u201csocialist.\u201d Unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as \u201csocialist.\u201d Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class.\n\nThirty years later, in the 1960s, President Johnson passed Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children, persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this county. Once again these vitally important programs were derided by the right wing as socialist programs that were a threat to our American way of life.\n\nThat was then. Now is now.\n\nToday, in 2015, despite the Wall Street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Depression, the American people are clearly better off economically than we were in 1937.\n\nBut, here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge and address. Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, despite major growth in the U.S. and global economy, tens of millions of American families continue to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families. The reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.\n\nThe rich get much richer. Almost everyone else gets poorer. Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections. Ordinary people don\u2019t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it.\n\nIf we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.\n\nWe need to create a culture which, as Pope Francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets.\n\nToday, in America, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top. In fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth \u2013 trillions of wealth \u2013 going from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent \u2013 a handful of people who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own over that period.\n\nUnbelievably, and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\n\nToday, in America, millions of our people are working two or three jobs just to survive. In fact, Americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country. Despite the incredibly hard work and long hours of the American middle class, 58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent.\n\nToday, in America, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income, is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago, after adjusting for inflation. Last year, the median female worker earned more than $1,000 less than she did in 2007.\n\nToday, in America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings \u2013 zero \u2013 while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death. \u201cHow will I retire with dignity?,\u201d they ask?\n\nToday, in America, nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of African American children, are living in poverty \u2014 the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth.\n\nToday, in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. Further, with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.\n\nToday, in America, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent. Meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.\n\nThe bottom line is that today in America we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality. A handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress.\n\nIn 1944, in his State of the Union speech, President Roosevelt outlined what he called a second Bill of Rights. This is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but, unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves.\n\nIn that remarkable speech this is what Roosevelt stated, and I quote: \u201cWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\u201d End of quote. In other words, real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt\u2019s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved. It is time that we did.\n\nIn that speech, Roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every American was entitled to: The right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing, and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. The right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care.\n\nWhat Roosevelt was stating in 1944, what Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today, is that true freedom does not occur without economic security.\n\nPeople are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours. People are not truly free when they have no health care.\n\nSo let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me. It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that; \u201cThis country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.\u201d It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in America today which is not only grossly unfair but, in many respects, corrupt.\n\nIt is a system, for example, which during the 1990s allowed Wall Street to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated. Then, ten years later, after the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of Wall Street led to their collapse, it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out. Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out. Quite a system!\n\nAnd, then, to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, the bankers were too big to jail. Kids who get caught possessing marijuana get police records. Wall Street CEOs who help destroy the economy get raises in their salaries. This is what Martin Luther King, Jr. meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.\n\nIn my view, it\u2019s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs. It means that we create a government that works for works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for.\n\nIt means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. This is not a radical idea. It exists in every other major country on earth. Not just Denmark, Sweden or Finland. It exists in Canada, France, Germany and Taiwan. That is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system. Yes. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country. But we must build on it and go further.\n\nMedicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, it would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy.\n\nPeople who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment. They could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees. Workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans. Instead, they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy. And by the way, moving to a Medicare for all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that, in the year 2015, a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago \u2013 and that public education must allow every person in this country, who has the ability, the qualifications and the desire, the right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free. This is also not a radical idea. It exists today in many countries around the world. In fact, it used to exist in the United States.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy. It makes far more sense to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10%. It is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for unemployed young people, than to lock them up and spend $80 billion a year through mass incarceration.\n\nDemocratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty: that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage \u2013 $15 an hour over the next few years. It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong Paid Family and Medical Leave legislation now in Congress. How can it possibly be that the United States, today, is virtually the only nation on earth, large or small, which does not guarantee that a working class woman can stay home for a reasonable period of time with her new-born baby? How absurd is that?\n\nDemocratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet, and that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.\n\nDemocratic socialism means, that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. Yes. Innovation, entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded. But greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support. It is not acceptable that in a rigged economy in the last two years the wealthiest 15 Americans saw their wealth increase by $170 billion, more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. Let us not forget what Pope Francis has so elegantly stated; \u201cWe have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.\u201d\n\nIt is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion in taxes each and every year. It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. It is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax. It is not acceptable that Wall Street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on those transactions.\n\nDemocratic socialism, to me, does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice. It also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote. It is extremely sad that the United States, one of the oldest democracies on earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country, and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely. Every American should be embarrassed that in our last national election 63% of the American people, and 80% of young people, did not vote. Clearly, despite the efforts of many Republican governors to suppress the vote, we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process, not harder. It is not too much to demand that everyone 18 years of age is registered to vote \u2013 end of discussion.\n\nFurther, it is unacceptable that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires, billionaires and large corporations to contribute as much as they want to Super Pacs to elect candidates who will represent their special interests. We must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.\n\nSo the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist, remember this:\n\nI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.\n\nI believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas.\n\nI believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes \u2013 if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in special treatment for the top 1%, but I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that Black Lives Matter.\n\nI despise appeals to nativism and prejudice, and I do believe in immigration reform that gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in some foreign \u201cism\u201d, but I believe deeply in American idealism.\n\nI\u2019m not running for president because it\u2019s my turn, but because it\u2019s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, not for the few, but for all.\n\nNo one understood better than FDR the connection between American strength at home and our ability to defend America at home and across the world. That is why he proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944, and said in that State of the Union:\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad, but to rebuild America\u2019s strength at home. I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight.\n\nAnd when we discuss foreign policy, let me join the people of Paris in mourning their loss, and pray that those who have been wounded will enjoy a full recovery. Our hearts also go out to the families of the hundreds of Russians apparently killed by an ISIS bomb on their flight, and those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere.\n\nTo my mind, it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric ISIS regime, and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing. But we cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 do it alone.\n\nOur response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy. It begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort, and that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades. It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past \u2013 rushing to war, regime change in Iraq, or toppling Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, or Guatemalan President \u00c1rbenz in 1954, Brazilian President Goulart in 1964, Chilean President Allende in 1973. These are the sorts of policies do not work, do not make us safer, and must not be repeated.\n\nAfter World War II, in response to the fear of Soviet aggression, European nations and the United States established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2013 an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy. It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror.\n\nWe must create an organization like NATO to confront the security threats of the 21st century \u2013 an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts. We must work with our NATO partners, and expand our coalition to include Russia and members of the Arab League.\n\nBut let\u2019s be very clear. While the U.S. and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations \u2013 with the strong support of their global partners.\n\nThese same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region. Jordan\u2019s King Abdallah II said in a speech on Sunday that terrorism is the \u201cgreatest threat to our region\u201d and that Muslims must lead the fight against it. He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility, and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology.\n\nAnd let me congratulate King Abdallah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region.\n\nA new and strong coalition of Western powers, Muslim nations, and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counter-terrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing, and to end support for exporting radical ideologies.\n\nWhat does all of this mean? Well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.\n\nEqually important, and this is a point that must be made \u2013 countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE \u2013 countries of enormous wealth and resources \u2013 have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little.\n\nSaudi Arabia has the 3rd largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by U.S. troops after the first Gulf War, has been a well-known source of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists. It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event \u2013 $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against ISIS. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups, including al Nusra and ISIS.\n\nAll of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them. As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need.\n\nFurther, we all understand that Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered many of his own people. I am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over world, known as the International Syria Support Group, set a timetable for a Syrian-led political transition with open and fair elections. These are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and to move to political transition.\n\nThe diplomatic plan for Assad\u2019s transition from power is a good step in a united front. But our priority must be to defeat ISIS. Nations all over the world, who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist, must make the destruction of ISIS the highest priority. Nations in the region must commit \u2013 that instead of turning a blind eye \u2014 they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq. We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism \u2013 rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders.\n\nThis is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face.\n\nWhile individual nations indeed have historic disputes \u2013 the U.S. and Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia \u2013 the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying ISIS. Sadly, as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized.\n\nThus, we must work with our partners in Europe, the Gulf states, Africa, and Southeast Asia \u2013 all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose.\n\nThe bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed, but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone. A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground, while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need.", "comment_3": "Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States - Bernie Sanders  https://t.co/tSeSbjfIR4 In his inaugural remarks in \u2026", "split": "train"}

PAUL, Minn. - The remarks, as prepared for delivery, of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in her address to the 2008 Republican National Convention accepting the party\u2019s vice presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored to be considered for the nomination for Vice President of the United States...\n\nI accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America.\n\nStory continues below \u2193 advertisement advertisement\n\nI accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country.\n\nAnd I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S. McCain.\n\nIt was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.\n\nWith their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war.\n\nBut the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.\n\nThey overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve, and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better.\n\nAnd maybe that's because they realize there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first.\n\nOur nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.\n\nHe's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight.\n\nAnd as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way.\n\nOur son Track is 19.\n\nAnd one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country.\n\nMy nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.\n\nMy family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children.\n\nIn our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow, and Piper.\n\nAnd in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.\n\nThat's how it is with us.\n\nOur family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys.\n\nSometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.\n\nAnd children with special needs inspire a special love.\n\nTo the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.\n\nI pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House.", "comment_3": "Posted on Skewz: ReviewJournal.com - News - Reid shares Senate ideas: \"I told him last nigh.. http://tinyurl.com/6hydf2", "split": "train"}

But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.\n\nTrump said, \"China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.\"\n\nWith the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nWhen we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea\u2019s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of \"total control.\"\n\n\"China does not \u2018control\u2019 North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,\" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.\n\nRobert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.\n\n\"It\u2019s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,\" Ross said. \"Do the parents have total control? Perhaps \u2013 they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive \u2013 driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.\"\n\nChina\u2019s leverage over North Korea\n\nThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.\n\nNorth Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea\u2019s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.\n\n\"North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,\" Haggard told PolitiFact.\n\nWhy \u2018total control\u2019 is an exaggeration\n\nYet while China\u2019s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn\u2019t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump\u2019s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\n\nFor starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.\n\n\"China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,\" Haggard said.\n\nIt also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn\u2019t exactly listen to outsiders.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,\" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. \"This is hardly control.\"\n\nNot only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country\u2019s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.\n\n\"North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,\" Revere said. \"This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.\"\n\nIndeed, despite North Korea\u2019s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, \"it is not clear that the leadership cares,\" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. \"For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea\u2019s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China\u2019s situation.\n\nThis was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.\n\n\"China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,\" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.\"\n\nThat does not sound like a country in \"total control\" of another.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim \"suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,\" Revere said. \"It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\"\n\nHe has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea\u2019s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump\u2019s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government\u2019s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching \"total control\" over North Korea.\n\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "comment_3": "Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea: Trump said, \"China, they don... https://t.co/3ouvu8YRTY", "split": "train"}

Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.", "comment_3": "PolitiFact | Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003 http://t.co/rDXwIYB via @politifact", "split": "train"}

He's president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.\n\nNo, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\n\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at.\n\nAnd you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?\n\nAnd we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.\n\nDAVID KEENE: I know they do.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband.\n\nThey wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\n\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\n\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\n\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\n\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\n\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\n\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\n\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\n\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\n\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\n\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\n\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\n\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\n\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keep databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\n\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\n\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\n\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they in fact train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\n\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\n\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\n\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\n\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\n\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\n\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\n\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\n\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\n\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\n\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\n\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\n\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\n\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\n\nBut, given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\n\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\n\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always.

That is and must be the roleof the private sector. But at this particular moment, with theprivate sector so weakened by this recession, the federal government isthe only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy backinto life. It is only government that can break the vicious cyclewhere lost jobs lead to people spending less money, which leads to evenmore layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the planthat's moving through Congress is designed todo.\n\nWhen passed, this plan will ensure thatAmericans who'velost their jobs through no fault of their own can receivegreater unemployment benefits and continue their health carecoverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are strugglingto pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth ofbadly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. Thesesteps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who aremost likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and getour economymoving.\n\nBut as we've learned very clearly andconclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all of our economicproblems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiestfew Americans.\n\nWe have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it'sonly helped lead us to the crisis we face rightnow.\n\nAnd that's why we have come together,around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for the middle class withdirect investment in areas like health care, energy, educationand infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, create new jobsand new businesses and help our economy grow again, now and in thefuture.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the jobs createdby this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to be make-work jobsbut jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobsrebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our dangerouslydeficient dams and levees, so that we don't face anotherKatrina.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey'll be jobs building the wind turbinesand solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower our dependence on foreign oiland modernizing our costly health care system that will save usbillions of dollars and countlesslives.\n\nThey'll be jobs creating the 21st-centuryclassrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children across America. And they'llbe the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide states with somerelief.\n\nNow after many weeks of debate and discussion, the planthat ultimately emerges from Congress must be big enough and bold enoughto meet the size of the economic challenges that we face rightnow. It's a plan that is already supported by businesses representingalmost every industry in America, by both the Chamber of Commerce andthe AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from bothDemocrats and Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented levelof transparency and accountability, so that every American will beable to go online and see where and how we're spending everydime.\n\nWhat it does not contain, however, is asingle pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped of the projects membersof both parties found mostobjectionable.\n\nNow despite all of this, the plan's notperfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this plan will workexactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that afailure to act will only deepen this crisis, as well as the pain feltby millions ofAmericans.\n\nMy administration inherited a deficit ofover $1 trillion,but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergencysince the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will resultin ever -- even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence.\n\nThose are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as I hold this office, Iwill do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and putthis country back towork.\n\nI want to thank the members of Congresswho've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also want to urge all membersof Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolvetheir differences and pass thisplan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe find ourselves in a rare moment wherethe citizens of our country and all countries are watching and waiting for us tolead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, butone that we must accept for the future of our children andour grandchildren.\n\nThe strongest democracies flourish fromfrequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of every background andbelief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of agreater purpose. That's the test facing the United States of Americain this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders and citizensto stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and monthsahead.\n\nAfter a day of speaking with and listeningto the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nation home, I have full faithand confidence that we can do it.\n\nBut we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead.\n\nAnd with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let mego to Jennifer Loven at AP. There youare.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. Earlier today in Indianayou said something striking. You said that this nation could endup in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead youto say that our recession might be permanent when others in ourhistory have not? And do you think that you risk losing somecredibility or even talking down the economy by using dire language likethat?\n\nMR. OBAMA: No, no, no,no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum,which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, thenyou potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much moredifficult for us to get outof.\n\nWe saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s,where they did notact boldly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered whatwas called the \"lost decade,\" where essentially for theentire '90s, they did not see any significant economicgrowth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo what I'm trying to underscore is whatthe people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not your ordinary,run-of-the-mill recession.\n\nWe are going through the worst economic crisis since theGreat Depression.\n\nWe've lost now 3.6 million jobs. Butwhat's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken placeover the last three months, which means that the problems areaccelerating instead of getting better.\n\nNow, what I said in Elkhart today is whatI'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solvethis problem, but it's going to require us to take somesignificant, importantsteps.\n\nStep number one, we have to pass aneconomic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was avote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. Wealready have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next severaldays that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences andget that bill on mydesk.\n\nThere have been criticisms from a bunch ofdifferent directions about this bill. So let me just address a few ofthem.\n\nSome of the criticisms really are with thebasic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace.\n\nAnd in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles thatI thought were resolved a pretty long timeago.\n\nMost economists, almost unanimously,recognize that evenif philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening inthe economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now --what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businessescan't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they startlaying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending --that when you have that situation, that government is an importantelement of introducing some additional demand into the economy. Westand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and anothertrillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole inthe economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat's why the -- the figure that weinitially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't justsome random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. Thatwas Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists thatI spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis andthe fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to havea bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net jobloss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in theright direction.\n\nNow, the recovery and reinvestment packageis not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are stillgoing to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get thecredit markets flowing again, because that's the lifeblood of theeconomy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are goingto start loosening up credit once again.\n\nAnd that means having some transparency and oversight in the system.\n\nIt means that we correct some of themistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity,in terms of how the program was going to moveforward.\n\nIt means that we condition taxpayerdollars that arebeing provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when itcomes to executive compensation, not using the money to chartercorporate jets when they're notnecessary.\n\nIt means that we focus on housing and howare we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who arestill making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline.\n\nSo there's going to be a whole range ofapproaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is tomake sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making surethat the financial system is working again, that homeowners aregetting somerelief.\n\nAnd I'm happy to get good ideas fromacross the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhat I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, becausethose theories have been tested and they have failed. And that'spart of what the election in November was all about. Okay?\n\nCaren Bohan ofReuters.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. I'd like to shift gearsto foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, andwhen will you start to implement it? Will your time table beaffected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting anyindications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the UnitedStates?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I said during thecampaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary historyand traditions, but that its actions over many years now havebeen unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both inthe region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their-- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah andHamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel,their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclearweapon -- that all of those things create the possibility ofdestabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I thinkare contrary to the interests of international peace.\n\nWhat I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal,and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security teamis currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areaswhere we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engagewith them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will belooking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting acrossthe table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow usto move our policy in a new direction.\n\nThere's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nAnd it's important that even as we engagein this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that wehave as a country, that Iran understands that we find the fundingof terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about thefact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in theregion that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going tobe a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but Ithink that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship ofmutual respect andprogress.\n\nAnd I think that if you look at howwe've approached theMiddle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy tohelp deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews thatI've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to dothings differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to sendsome signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognizethat even as it is has some rights as a member of theinternational community, with those rights come responsibilities.\n\nOkay.\n\nMR. OBAMA: ChipReid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nYou have often said that bipartisanship isextraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now whenwe ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votesin the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not thenumber of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will becreated.\n\nIs that a sign that you are moving away,your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And whatwent wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to changethe way Washingtonworked?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I don't think -- Idon't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimatedit. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up herein Washington. And it's going to take time to break down some ofthose badhabits.\n\nYou know, when I made a series ofovertures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know,putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, totalk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designedsimply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try tobuild up some trust over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated.\n\nBut understand the bottom line that I'vegot right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happeningacross the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usualpolitical games. What we have to do right now is deliver for theAmerican people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recoverypackage is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, becauseeverybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting peopleback to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, thatthey can send their kids tocollege.\n\nThat doesn't negate the continuing effortsthat I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues. Andhopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civiland respectful, will pay some dividends over the longterm.\n\nThere are going to be areas where wedisagree and there are going to be areas where we agree.\n\nAs I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been saidin Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don'tdoubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should donothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing positionin negotiations, then we're probably not going to make muchprogress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't thinkwhat -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand byand donothing.\n\nThere are others who recognize that we'vegot to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what'sin there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy tohave conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut orthis infrastructure project versus that infrastructureproject.\n\nBut what I -- what I've been concernedabout is some ofthe language that's been used suggesting that this is full of porkand this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling ofthe national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage insome revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we haveright now and the economic crisis that we have rightnow.\n\nNumber two is that, although there aresome programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't jobcreators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs shouldbe out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal withthem later.\n\nBut when they start characterizing this as porkwithout acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package --something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then youget a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actuallytrying to solve problems for the Americanpeople.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo I'm going to keep on engaging. Ihope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing togive a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is notgoing to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is,arewe creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation forlong- term economicgrowth?\n\nThis is another concern that I've had insome of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste ofmoney to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that bea waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately byretrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economicstimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federalbuildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they willsee more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence onforeign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make thatkind of investment?\n\nNow, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen todisagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselvesimporting more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s,when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate aboutwhether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don'tsuggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly whatthis countryneeds.\n\nThe same applies when it comes toinformation technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businessesand making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks offamilies all across America. And part of the reason is we've got themost inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still usingpaper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nursescan't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have writtenout. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on anelectronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-termcost of health care, and create jobs rightnow?\n\nEducation, yet another example. Thesuggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad,and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacherhas to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium iscompletely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need forthe 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, rightnow will createjobs?\n\nSo, you know, we can differ on some of theparticulars,but again, the question I think that the American people are asking is,do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it todo something? If you want it to do something, then we can havea conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option frommy perspective.\n\nAll right. Chuck Todd. Where'sChuck?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. In your opening remarks,you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work,it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumerspending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people getmoney back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or payingdown debt first, before they start spending money into theeconomy?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, first of all,I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What gotus into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild riskswith other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because ofthe enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets and theywere betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in thefinancial system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat led to a contraction of credit, whichin turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meantthat everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy.\n\nSo people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made thingsworse.\n\nNow, you are making a legitimate point,Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has beendriven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's notgoing to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending andwe're not making things, then over time, other countries are going to gettired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to beover.\n\nWell, in fact, the party now isover. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is tostop the downward spiral. And that means putting money intoconsumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit.\n\nIt means putting forward investments thatnot only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economicgrowth. And that by the way is important, even if you're afiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have,with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which thereare no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at thesame time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we'vegot more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demandfor food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget.\n\nSo the most important thing we can do forour budget crisisright now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue totank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thingto do, even though I recognize that it's expensive.\n\nLook, I would love not to have to spendmoney right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned upto spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn'thow I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt toexisting circumstances.\n\nNow, what we are going to also have to dois to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we'reno longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm andlong-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true forindividual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying tofigure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financialplanning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce the economy stabilizes and people areless fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how dowe operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a freelunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house,then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably notaffordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has tobe reconsidered.\n\nSo we're going to have to change our --our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out ofthe economic slump that we'rein.\n\nAll right. Julianna Goldman,Bloomberg.\n\nQUESTION Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nMany experts, from Nouriel Roubini toSenator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, youpromised the American people that you won't just tell them what they wantto hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government needfar more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fundto really solve the credit crisis?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it'snot over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing the TARPlegislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistencyin how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- in -- in how themoney went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as weshould have.\n\nMy immediate task is making sure that thesecond half ofthat money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my firstjob. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is tomake sure that my secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, workingwith Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, are comingup with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a waythat's transparent, in a way that provides clear oversight; that weare conditioning any money that we give to banks on themreducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and to make surethat they're not wasting thatmoney.\n\nWe are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restoredwithin the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is thatnobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank,they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open thingsup and restore sometrust.\n\nWe also have to deal with the housingissue in a clearand consistentway.\n\nI don't want to preempt my secretary ofthe Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's createa template in which we're restoring market confidence. And thereason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we'regoing to need additional money or how much additional money we'll needuntil we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidencein a marketplace that the federal government and the Federal ReserveBank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing.\n\nThat can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace. Andultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that hasbeen withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence,so that private capital goes backin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOkay.\n\nJake.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. My question followsJulianna's incontent.\n\nThe American people have seen hundreds ofbillions ofdollars spent already. And still the economy continues tofree-fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, onceall the legs of your stool are in place--\n\nMR. OBAMA: Right.\n\nQUESTION: -- how canthe American people gauge whether or notyour programs areworking?\n\nCan they -- should they be looking at themetric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric shouldthey use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether ornot we need to go to a Plan B?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I think my initialmeasure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line numberone, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidenceto make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeingthat consumers are out there with a little more confidence. Andthey start making investments, which means they start hiring workers.\n\nSo step number one, jobcreation.\n\nStep number two, are we seeing the creditmarketsoperate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businessesthat I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't getcredit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was thefact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch ofRV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, buteven though their credit is good, they can't get theloan.\n\nNow, the businesses also can't get loansto make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumerscan't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit marketsis, I think, step number two.\n\nStep number three is going to behousing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn'thave complete control over that. But if our plan is effective,working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think whatwe can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can startstabilizing housing values over time.\n\nAnd the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this isan unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficultyear -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businessesstart investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, infact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumersstart feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they startmaking purchases again. And if we get things right then, startingnext year, we can start seeing some significantimprovement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEd Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There heis.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. You've promised to sendmore troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear abouta time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months,I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventuallyfrom Afghanistan?\n\nAnd related to that, there's a Pentagonpolicy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming into Dover AirForce Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that itwas shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into thecountry under the cover ofnight.\n\nYou've promised unprecedentedtransparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the Americanpeople can see the full human cost of war?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Your question is timely. We got reportsthat four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to thefamilies.\n\nI've said before that, you know, peoplehave asked me, \"When did it hit you that you are now president?\" And what I toldthem was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of ourfallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carryin this office and the consequences of decisions that youmake.\n\nNow with respect to the policy of openingup media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewingthose policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. SoI don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that reviewand understand all the implicationsinvolved.\n\nWith respect to Afghanistan, this is goingto be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops andsome very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, wejust saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and youget a sense that the political system is now functioning in ameaningful way.\n\nYou do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national government seems verydetached from what's going on in the surrounding community. Inaddition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA andthese border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what wehaven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safehavens that would ultimately make our missionsuccessful.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo we are undergoing a thorough-goingreview. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his ownreview, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sentover -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluatea regional approach. We are going to need more effectivecoordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts withdevelopment efforts with more effective coordination with our allies in orderfor us to be successful.\n\nThe bottom line, though -- and I just want to rememberthe American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is thisis a situation in which a region served as the base to launch anattack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met withfamilies of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs ofallowing those safe havens toexist.\n\nMy bottom line is that we cannot allow alQaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're goingto have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, inorder to make sure that those safe havens don'texist.\n\nI do not have yet a timetable for how longthat's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allowal Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks onthe U.S. homeland. All right.\n\nHelene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here yougo.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you,sir.\n\nI wanted to ask you, on the next bankbailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this moneyto loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do youmake the case to the American people that this bailout will work whenthe last one didn't?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I --I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of youto show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to beterrific.\n\nBut this relates to Jake's earlierquestion. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who needit. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing tobusinesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are theyable to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth onMain Street?\n\nAnd the package that we've put together isdesigned to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim getshis moment in the sun tomorrow, allright?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMajor Garrett. Where isMajor?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President,at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversationthe two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn'tdisclose. \"If we do everything right, if we do it with absolutecertainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there'sstill a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong.\"\n\nSince the vice president brought it up,can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulusbill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with that ratioof success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success?\n\nMR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) Youknow, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try thisout.\n\nI think what Joe may have been suggesting,although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to anyof this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have,any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, notall of thesolution.\n\nAnd as I said in my introductory remarks,not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. Thisis an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk toeconomists, there's some general sense of how we're going to move forward.\n\nThere's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that youshouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment,but that there should be a range ofapproaches.\n\nBut even if we do everything right onthat, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system andmaking sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to haveto deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure thatwe've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for thefinancial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks.\n\nSo I don't know whether Joe was referringto that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about theseissues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I have noidea. I reallydon't.\n\nMichael Fletcher, The WashingtonPost.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you,sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroids as a member of theTexas Rangers?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think it'sdepressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight.\n\nAnd you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids.\n\nWhat I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated.\n\nAll right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens.\n\nThey're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children.\n\nAnd you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue.\n\nQUESTION: Did you get any promise from them?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat.\n\nWith respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger.\n\nAnd one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally.\n\nI think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that --\n\nMR. OBAMA: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nSam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam?\n\nQUESTION: Right here.\n\nMR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToday, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration.\n\nHe said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven't seen.\n\nWhat I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary.\n\nMy view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information.\n\nSo I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward.\n\nMara Liasson.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more.\n\nWhat do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it.\n\nAnd whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done.\n\nNow, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there.\n\nI mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultation.\n\nOne thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And let me give you a prime example.\n\nWhen it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility.\n\nHaving said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem.\n\nI think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards.\n\nSo my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package.\n\nAnd so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to be cleared up.\n\nBut I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide.\n\nAll right?\n\nSTAFF: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: One more, Mr. President.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, guys.", "comment_3": "Transcript: Obama's prime-time press briefing http://jijr.com/mFV", "split": "train"}

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico.

Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the world\u2019s largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines.\n\nTo aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement \u2013 close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally.\n\nUNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities.\n\nUNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission.\n\n\u201cResettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,\u201d said Pitterman.", "comment_3": "#reliefweb United States of America: UN Refugee Agency welcomes arrival of 10,000th Syrian refugee resettled to\u2026 https://t.co/2NqQ1aKHE0", "split": "train"}

Watch LIVE: https://t.co/rcsq4mHj2l\"", "article": "Rose Garden\n\n5:35 P.M. EDT\n\nMR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nIn our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.\n\nWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n\nAnd that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.\n\nExpanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with \u201cA\u201d ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It\u2018s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\nWe'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.\n\nWe take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.\n\nOn behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Connecticut\u2019s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They\u2019ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.\n\nWe will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.\n\nWe leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.\n\nThank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who\u2019s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers \u2013- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.\n\nFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders \u2013- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We\u2019re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it\u2019s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.\n\nA majority of senators voted \u201cyes\u201d to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m going to speak plainly and honestly about what\u2019s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -\u2013 both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with \u201cA\u201d grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.\n\nTheir legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she\u2019s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.\n\nIn fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn\u2019t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That\u2019s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.\n\nBut instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of \u201cbig brother\u201d gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they\u2019re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.\n\nBut the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn\u2019t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn\u2019t prevent all future massacres. And that\u2019s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.\n\nAnd this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.\n\nI've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn\u2019t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?\n\nI've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \"A prop,\" somebody called them. \u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don\u2019t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?\n\nSo all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.\n\nBut this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don\u2019t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We\u2019re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We\u2019re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We\u2019re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.\n\nBut we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.\n\nTo all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don\u2019t act this time, you will remember come election time.\n\nTo the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn\u2019t represent your views on this one.\n\nThe point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They\u2019ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n\nSo to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you\u2019ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they\u2019ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.\n\nAnd I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We\u2019re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.\n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming that the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who\u2019ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I\u2019m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I\u2019m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND 5:55 P.M.

But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.\n\nOn Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms \u2014 a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.\n\nSome of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died.

I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither.

Look, everyone wants to parachute out of this conflict. I get that. But the Russians have offered us not a parachute but a knapsack. A knapsack that will never open. This is nothing more than a delay tactic.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, I disagree. First of all, I think the world is rightfully happy that we are off the path to war, possibly. The diplomatic option is a good thing. And frankly, everybody is giving John Kerry a hard time. I would rather for us to blunder on the path to peace than to stumble onto the path of war.\n\n\n\nCUPP: If this were proposal -- if this proposal were real and offered up by legitimate, good actors, I would be happy to consider it.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, welcome to the real world, where you don't get the chance to pick who offers you a solution to this thing.\n\n\n\nLook, we've got two former presidential candidates and two former senators -- both the same person -- tonight on CROSSFIRE to help us with this thing.\n\n\n\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR: Two friends, I might add. And two friends.\n\n\n\nJONES: And two friends. Republican Rick Santorum is against attacking Syria. Democratic former senator, now independent, Joe Lieberman, he supports the strike.\n\n\n\nThe first question to you. You've got to be happy now. We've got a big diplomatic opening. You've got to be on President Obama's team now. You're happy, right?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Leading question.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If there's not going to be a military attack, that's a good thing. So if the president is willing to step down for whatever reason, look, he -- he went to the Congress because he didn't want to do this. If he wanted to do it, he'd said he had the power to do it. And he just decided not to.\n\n\n\nWhen you consider the fact that, whether it's on immigration or health care or on DOMA or on a whole variety of things --\n\n\n\nJONES: But are you --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- he's done things that he doesn't have the power to do. Now he has the power to do something, and he went to Congress. So it's clear he didn't want to do this.\n\n\n\nJONES: You're on team Obama now.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I'm on team \"let's not broaden this war and put a much more complicated diplomatic situation and military situation in the hands of someone who's proved incapable of handling the situation.\"\n\n\n\nJONES: We'll argue about that later.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Lieberman, why after two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?\n\n\n\nJOE LIEBERMAN (I), FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR: Well, I wish we were not pausing. I mean, I think President Obama made the right moral decision when he drew the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- and then when he said, after we had proof that chemical weapons were used to kill almost 1,500 innocents, including 426 children by Assad in Syria, that he was going to take military action.\n\n\n\nI was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it. If he had, I think the American people would have been happy now that he had done it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Should he attack now? Should he attack now without Congress?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I -- well, I think, now that Russia has made this offer, even though it's hard to take it seriously coming from Russia which hasn't been our friend -- just look at the Snowden matter.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Look at Syria, where Assad -- John Kerry said correctly last week that he tried very hard to reach an agreement with Assad years ago as a senator and decided he was a liar.\n\n\n\nJONES: But you're not saying we should through this peace offering in the garbage can and then -- and then attack now. Is that what you're saying?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No, I'm saying that it's hard to take the proposal by Russia seriously, but it's important enough that we've got to challenge them to be serious about it and see if Syria really will, with international supervision and penalties, get rid of all their chemical weapons. If they did that, it would be a tremendous accomplishment.\n\n\n\nBut I think the president still has to face the fact, if nothing happens, that there was a chemical attack --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The bottom line is here we have no national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We don't have any national security interests when children are being chemically --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Then we should be in Darfur. Then we should be in 50 other countries around the world.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not a reason.\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about al Qaeda?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I wish -- I wish -- that is the point. The point is we have no set national security interest, because the two sides of this conflict are both enemies of the United States. We have al Qaeda, who is basically the dominant rebel force right now, on one side and we have on the other side Hezbollah, Iran, Russia and Assad. JONES: I don't understand what you want to do, though. Here's my problem. You are a leader on Syria. You are a big supporter and, frankly, the author of the Syrian Accountability Act.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I was.\n\n\n\nJONES: And now you seem to have completely disappeared. What is it that you think that should happen? I want to show you -- show you these images that have shocked the world. Can we show these images?\n\n\n\nLook at these children. They're twitching. They're dying. What if one of the mothers of one of those children called this station right now and said to you, \"Why won't you help me? Why won't you help my children?\" You're saying there's no interest in doing that.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The reason the United States -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this. We may disagree on where we come out, but the reason the United States uses military forces for one reason and one reason only. It's in our national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We have no moral obligation?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation. We have other obligations.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look, what -- but what can we do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We need to get involved. We need to -- the Syrian Accountability Act was about political sanctions. It was about economic sanctions. It was no trip wire for military force. And when the president used the Syrian Accountability Act as reasons for Congress to support him, he misled the American public on that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: As the author, I know that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, I know you. We go back a little ways. We've had some conservations about faith and morality and values, social conservatism. I don't understand -- help me understand -- how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How -- how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: They're fighting for their freedom, incidentally, which is what America's supposed to be all about.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes. And how -- aren't you worried this will be another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: This didn't start out as al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I agree. And I called for military force 18 months ago.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right. As did I. As did I.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I met with the opposition. And there -- these were patriots, Syrian patriots, freedom fighters --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- who were sick of the dictator.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We held back and al Qaeda came in. I don't think al Qaeda is the dominant force in the opposition. I think from all I know it's the Syrian people who want to change from Assad. And they deserve --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: I want to give him a chance to say something, because listen, I want to double down on peace. I don't want to double down on war. I think that we have diplomatic options we haven't exhausted. My quarrel with the president all week long has been we're rushing to war.\n\n\n\nBut my problem is, I want to double down on peace; some people want to double down on war. It seems like you're doubling down on nothing. What do you want us to do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's -- let's --\n\n\n\nJONES: If you were the president, what would you do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Well, first off, go back and look at the debates that occurred about 18 months ago. And I, in those debates, called for the president to intervene, to side with exactly the people that Joe Lieberman was talking about, and get involved, give them --\n\n\n\nJONES: So we had an interest then, but we don't have an interest now?\n\n\n\nHold on a second. How do we have an interest then and not now?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Everything has changed.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Everything has changed. Everything has changed. The people who are the rebels in Syria right now are not the same people that we --\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That we could have been partners with 18 months ago.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But it's not going to get better if we hang back. I mean, if we get involved in one level and support the moderates there -- and there are moderates there who are our friends -- then they'll have a better opportunity to control the country when Assad goes.\n\n\n\nRight now, I think we've got to hang tough. And tonight, the president's got a real challenge, but -- because of all of the twists and turns of the story -- but he's got a great opportunity to tell people why he thinks it's worth us carrying out limited but decisive attacks. CUPP: What does he need to say tonight? What does he need to say tonight?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Well, I think he needs to say, one, we can't -- we can't handle every problem in the world. But Americans, you know, we have a Declaration of Independence that talks about the self-evident truth that everybody -- not just Americans but in the world -- got from our creator the rights to life and liberty. And these people in Syria have been deprived of both of those rights.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the point. If you let a dictator mass murder his people and you turn away from it, he's going to keep going. And every other madman is going to keep going.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Sure. And haven't we learned this lesson?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Two different -- two different lessons. First off, there are lot -- there are lots of dictators, unfortunately, in this world who are mass murdering their people. We've seen it. We've seen it under President Obama. We saw it under President Bush. It's under presidents for decades now. The United States has not stepped in unless there's a national security interest military. We've stepped in in other ways, but we have not stepped in militarily.\n\n\n\nBut the president is going to change that and say that humanitarian reasons and the reason we're going to step in and -- and engage in military conflict. We are broadening -- you want to talk about not being a cop on the beat. You want to talk about something you and folks that -- that have been advocating for us to have -- make peace not war. We've now opened up Pandora's box as to military use. It's a bad idea. It's not in the security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: I want -- I want you to respond to this. My quarrel with the president is I think he did two things right and one thing wrong. I think he was right to say this is an outrage, and we're not going to let babies get gassed.\n\n\n\nCUPP: And then do nothing about it?\n\n\n\nJONES: I think that was right. I think he was wrong to rush into a war posture without talking to Congress, without bringing in the U.N., without bringing a global coalition, without exhausting --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: He did that when he set the red line, with Russia. And he set the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Months ago.\n\n\n\nJONES: And he did -- and I think he did. Because he waited -- and I'm surprised you say you wish we'd gone in -- because he waited, we now have a new opening.\n\n\n\nDo you disagree that the president, by putting those warships out there and waiting, don't you agree he created an opening now for peace? You're saying that the president has done nothing right this whole crisis?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If we believe Putin and Assad are legitimate actors in the diplomatic stage. Well, but that's who's come forward, and it's not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: It's who we got.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It's who we got. And so, look, I'm perfectly willing to let this play out. I want us to not strike Syria --\n\n\n\nJONES: You and me both.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- because I think streaking Syria, at this point in time, will create a real problem for us militarily with Russia, with potentially others in the region.\n\n\n\nWe are taking -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this one. The whole Syria conflict at this point, has taken our eye off the ball. And the ball is Iran. Syria is a puppet state of Iran.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: That's exactly the reason why we can't let Assad get away.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right. Iran is watching.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: It's the biggest body blow we could land to Iran. He's their only ally in the Arab world. And this -- even this proposal, which if it works for Russia, will be a good thing. The price of it will be that Assad will stay there, and Iran will still have its No. 1 ally in the Arab world.\n\n\n\nCUPP: All right. Well, let's -- let's continue this over in the next -- in the next segment. There are a lot of creative solutions that don't involve bombing and killing people apparently.\n\n\n\nYes, there are and we'll talk about it when we get back. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nTonight President Obama addresses the nation about Syria. He's hitting the pause button on the military strikes. That gives us time for some creative solutions. And we should keep the warships parked off of there. But what about helping refugees? What about an arms embargo? What about cyber-attacks, what about anything? It's all either war or nothing.\n\n\n\nI'm going to ask you: If there were a dome over Syria, so it was not about bomb or don't bomb, what are some of the creative things we could do that don't involve war? How do we win without war?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Unfortunately, if there were a dome over Syria, there was nothing we could do to stop the bloodshed. Because you've got a basically unfair fight here. The government has most of the fire power. Finally, the patriots, the freedom fighter Syrians, have gotten help from outside. But they're still getting decimated. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: This is America. You're saying there's nothing we can do? It's either Tomahawk missiles or nothing? We're the most creative --\n\n\n\nCUPP: But the dome doesn't exist, Van. The dome is fantasy land. Let's deal with reality.\n\n\n\nJONES: The fact -- let's get with reality. We have someone here --\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Let me say something about the dome. Because the other reason it's gone --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Van Jones Dome.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The dome is unreal, but what that really reminds us of is that their neighbors there -- Israel, Iraq, Jordan -- they're all being -- Lebanon -- they're all being badly affected by what's going on in Syria. Our allies are.\n\n\n\nJONES: This is a crisis in our country, of imagination. How can we get out of this without bombs. You tell us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That's why -- that's why Rick Santorum, 18 months ago, during the presidential campaign --\n\n\n\nJONES: Today.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- said we should be arming the rebels.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We should be supporting them militarily. We should be supporting them economically. We should be doing everything --\n\n\n\nJONES: That's all in the past.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We agree --\n\n\n\nJONES: And now we give up. Because we didn't do what you wanted so we just give up.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Because a lot of folks -- hello?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hello?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A lot of folks said no, we had no interest in this.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hey, listen.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Do you admit you were wrong?\n\n\n\nJONES: I'll tell you what: I'm going to shock you. I think the Democrats were wrong for not taking Syria more seriously earlier. But I think it's wrong, and I'm giving you an opportunity. I don't want to go to war. I think there are a lot of things we could do that would get us out of the situation without war. You are somebody who's got some ideas about it, but I don't hear anybody talking about what can we do.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator, you've said Assad -- Assad has to go. You've said Assad has to go. How do you do it without military intervention?\n\n\n\nJONES: What can we do?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: This is very difficult right now. When you look at the rebels and the composition of the rebel forces, you see -- you're seeing on YouTube how rebel forces are, you know -- these radical al- Qaeda folks are killing off other rebel leaders and are doing atrocities to the public also.\n\n\n\nJONES: But if you were president --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You are going to say we are going to come on the side of them and help them.\n\n\n\nJONES: That's terrible. Help us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: But we can't. No, what we have to do is do what we should have done from the very beginning, which is let's identify, as we can, and support and protect and defend the legitimate elements within the rebel forces. Begin the process of arming them, protecting them, et cetera.\n\n\n\nJONES: You agree with this?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I totally agree. I just want to say something. You've been using the word \"war.\" Nobody's talking about war. President Obama's not talking about war. He's not talking about any American boots on the ground. He's talking about limited, decisive attacks.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because you are not that naive, Senator Lieberman. You know that, even though President Obama is saying no boots on the ground, if one of our planes goes down, we're sending boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Yes, but that -- everybody's --\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a lot bigger conflict than he thinks.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I don't believe so. It's not going to be a massive land invasion.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, what the president could have done when he decided to send it to Congress in taking the military action limited that he has in mind, is not a precedent. President Reagan did it in Grenada and struck at Libya when he thought the Libyans blew up a disco in Germany.\n\n\n\nYou know, President Clinton went into Bosnia, and people could argue we had no national security interests there, but a lot of people were getting slaughtered --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- by the Serbs at that point. And it goes on and on. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: I'm glad the president went to Congress. I think the president going to Congress is the best thing that happened, because it gave us time. You don't agree with me.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No. Here's my concern when he did it. I don't think he had to do it. He himself said, and I think he was right, that he had the legal authority to take action himself as commander in chief under the War Powers Resolution, everything else. He took an enormous risk, and unfortunately, he's in a quagmire now, because the risk was that Congress would say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, now they're both being delayed, and the U.N. is -- the U.N. is now a forum where -- I don't understand why you can say it's a bad thing. The delay gave us time.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Don't worry. The U.N.'s on it.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You may have not seen the polls. I'm not a great poll- watcher. But the American public is overwhelmingly against the president. The president's been making this case now for several weeks. They are against military action. They do not see any positive benefit for the United States in getting involved in a war between two radical elements of which neither are our friends.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Now I want to -- I want to quote you -- I'm quoting from the New Testament, Corinthians: \"When the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?\" So I think people are so confused about what's going on here. If --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The president says he has to do it, but then he goes to Congress.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: If you looked at the polls earlier, there was authority for a limited strike without American boots on the ground, particularly if we had some support from other --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you, Senator -- go ahead.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Here's the president says we need to do it, but I'm going to ask Congress. We need to strike, but it's not going to be decisive. Of course, the American people is going to say what the heck are we doing here?\n\n\n\nBecause here's the problem: If we actually do act, and if the Russians or the Iranians or somebody else say, \"You know what? You've drawn a line in the sand for us and we're going to -- we're going to act back,\" now we've put the United States in a much broader war with a president who is clearly over his head.\n\n\n\nJONES: Listen, I don't -- I do not agree the president is in over his head. First of all, let's be clear. This is a president who built a -- he built a coalition to --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Really?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let me finish. He isolated Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A coalition?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let's walk through the list before we take him down too hard. He got -- he got Russia and China to be with us against Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop right there. Stop. Whoa!\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Forget Libya.\n\n\n\nJONES: Libya.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop at Iran. Is Iran pursuing the nuclear weapons program? They have not drawn down.\n\n\n\nJONES: The answer is -- Do you want a war? Do you want a war?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line.\n\n\n\nJONES: Yes. We're doing cyber-attacks. We're doing an embargo.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line with Iran, and we have done nothing publicly.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you. This is a very good opportunity --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a very good opportunity -- very good opportunity to talk about the U.N. The U.N. -- no one, maybe except Van, trusts the Russians in this new plan to seize chemical weapons from Assad. But I fear that a lot of people trust the U.N. to do that.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. does not have a terribly impressive track record when it comes to ending conflicts. Are you worried? Should the American people trust U.N. to oversee this new Russian plan?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The U.N. works sometimes. Other times it doesn't. The record is mixed. The question is what passes in the U.N.? If, as France --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, nothing if you're Russia and China.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: France tabled a resolution in the Security Council today that basically embraced the Russian proposal that the Syrians get rid of their chemical weapons with international supervision and said that, if they didn't, then force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council. I thought that was great, because it called -- called Russia's bluff.\n\n\n\nAnd what do you think Russia did? They said that was unacceptable. They don't want a mandatory resolution with teeth in it. They want it to be a presidential statement of kind of appealing to Syria.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It calls into question Russia's credibility with this entire proposal.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Do you trust -- wait, let me ask. Do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Pick an issue. The answer is no.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Exactly right.\n\n\n\nJONES: A hundred and seventy-two successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations for some. Listen, we always focus -- 172 --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia --\n\n\n\nJONES: The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That is not -- that is a total inaccuracy.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look right here: 172 peacekeeping --\n\n\n\nCUPP: I have a list, too, of atrocities that they have taken responsibility for and not changed. The world feels very good about itself when it allows the U.N. to take over, because it feels like it's doing something. It's false security.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, listen -- Here's what I don't understand. When George W. Bush brought in the United Nations, people thought that was a good thing. He was trying to bring in the global community. I thought that you wanted us to build a big global coalition. I think we have a moment now to do so.\n\n\n\nAnd why do we have it? We have it for two reasons. One, he went to Congress, which you don't like. And two, because as much as we do not trust the Russians for their own interests, they are moving. Why are you mad at Congress and the U.N.?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Name -- name the countries that are for the United States getting involved militarily in Syria.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, apparently, there's France. Militarily?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The people that want us to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: You can answer that.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: There's about 15 that signed that statement calling for action.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Action but not military action.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But you know what? The president has --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: There's a big difference between action and military action. I'm for action. I'm just not for -- I'm not for a military strike. Particularly one that's not decisive and is not going to accomplish anything.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the problem. I think a military strike today will hurt Assad. I think that's the reason why, at least in words, he's accepted this Russian proposal.\n\n\n\nI don't believe him for a minute. I'll believe it when I see it, when he gives us his chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But I think he's scared of a strike. We're going to hit his command and control.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out. We strike Assad. We -- we knock out a few command and control operations. Then where do we go?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Then we give more support to the Syrian opposition. Because they will have a tremendous boost in morale.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Why can't we do that without striking?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We can, but we've got to strike him because he used chemical weapons. And if we don't, then he'll use them again.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: And you don't have any -- you don't have any fear or concern that any other country will, as a result of us striking Syria, do something to -- to insert themselves even in that conflict or potentially against the United States?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: They might but you know, when you're -- we can't -- we can't act out of fear of what might happen. We're strong. We're still the strongest country in the world.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We're not. We're not acting like -- we're not acting like a leader. We're not acting strong. We're acting like someone who said, don't knock this off my shoulder and you do. And so I -- OK, so I've got a fight back. We have to have --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The shoulder was the high moral ground about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It wasn't a high moral ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Assad have used chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons -- LIEBERMAN: You've got to say no.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons is very different than WMD that Iran is working on. That's where we should focus our attention.\n\n\n\nCUPP: OK. Thanks to Joe Lieberman and Rick Santorum. It was a great debate. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nNext, we \"Cease Fire.\" There's something important here we need to agree on. Not just the two of us but the whole country.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, we've been debating and fighting about what to do about Syria. But now we're going to call a \"Cease Fire.\"\n\n\n\nNow I think, and I want to come back to a point I made. I think that I have to admit that you guys have been right about something. You guys have been out, you in particular, out there for two years saying we've got to do something about Syria, something about Syria.\n\n\n\nI hate your solution.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes.\n\n\n\nJONES: I don't like the war. But you are pointing to the right problem. And I think a lot of people on the left were ducking it, and we weren't dealing with it. And I think that what my lesson out of this is, even when we don't agree, we've got to listen to each other more than we did.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, and I appreciate that. And I will return a favor and say, look, I don't agree with your solutions either, but at least you've been consistent. I think a lot of Democrats and liberals have talked about President Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to President Bush's. And you hold Obama to the same standard as you hold President Bush, and that -- that says a lot about your credibility.\n\n\n\nJONES: Here we go. The two of us, we agreed, and the world didn't come to an end.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Here's another thing we agree on: Your opinion matters. You can weigh in on our \"Fire Back\" question via Facebook or Twitter. \"Should the U.S. trust Russia's offer to rid Syria of chemical weapons?\" Right now 41 percent of you say yes; 59 percent say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: The debate continues online at CNN.com/crossfire. You can also go to Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\nFrom the left, I'm Van Jones.\n\n\n\nCUPP: and from the right, I'm S.C.

Advances Endorsement for Obama in 2012 - New York Times (blog): The National Education... http://bit.ly/iKNU4q", "target": "real", "comment_1": "The Guessing Game (album) : The Caucus: Guessing Game Over Prominent Blagojevich Witnesses - New York Times (blog) http://uxp.in/36236759", "article": "Updated: ASPEN \u2014 Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.\n\nThey gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.\n\nAnd at a fund-raising event earlier in the day \u2014 one of three \u2013he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I relish and that\u2019s what I like,\u2019\u2019 he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is \u201cabout the size of Senator Obama\u2019s foreign-policy team.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMany on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.\n\nMr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, \u201cthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, \u201cI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,\u201d and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it\u2019s closer to $5 a gallon.\n\nAt one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his \u201cmaverick\u201d stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?\n\nIn a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the \u201cChristian right.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush\u2019s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.\n\nAs for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a \u201ctraitor,\u201d Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.\n\nHe said he himself had been called \u201cdisloyal\u201d by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn\u2019t work. He said he had been \u201cdeclared dead,\u201d but he was reminded of Chairman Mao\u2019s saying that \u201cit\u2019s always darkest before it\u2019s totally black.\u201d But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, \u201che voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.\u201d He added: \u201cI think he\u2019s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,\u201d he said, to sustained applause.\n\nHe also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, \u201cwe passed up an opportunity\u201d to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.\n\nHe also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThe kind of war they\u2019re fighting requires long-term commitment,\u201d he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.\n\nOn the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA\u2019s \u201cDancing Queen\u201d was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d\n\nHe said that if he\u2019s \u201clacking in anything,\u201d it is an appreciation for music and art and \u201cthe other great things in life,\u201d partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.\u2019How come everybody goes to \u2018Mamma Mia!?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody goes! They\u2019ve been selling out for years.\u201d\n\nAfter another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.\n\n\u201cI appreciate art,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m going to do and I have the opportunity, it\u2019s to take a class in art.\u201d He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, \u201cbut some of the things weren\u2019t there that I would like to see.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.\u201d", "comment_3": "Virginia : The Caucus: McDonnell Says a Governor Should Replace Obama - New York Times (blog) http://uxp.in/34601422", "split": "train"}

I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service.\n\nTonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic, since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.\n\nBy coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate - and right now, as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. OK, you got your little wave to the families in.\n\nIt's great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.\n\nI would like to begin with Libya. On a rather somber note, one month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear, there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It - Chris\n\nStevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans.\n\nI can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight. One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever - wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.\n\nWhen you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 - he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.\n\nWith regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \"My highest priority is to get bin Laden.\"\n\nPrior to the election, prior to the - him being sworn in, said, \"I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.\" He didn't understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield. It was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be. And lastly, the president of the United States has - has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nHe went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times - he talked about the YouTube video.\n\nlook, if we're hit by terrorists we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an Al Qaida cell with arms?\n\nThis is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.\n\nWith respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration. Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement. We don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one. That's what we are talking about.\n\nNow, when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.\n\nNow, with respect to Afghanistan, the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad, and that's what's happening here.\n\nRYAN: This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself, but unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem. And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the (inaudible) more chaotic us less safe.\n\nRADDATZ: I just want to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness; talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\n\nRYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will - it's never too early to speak out for our values.\n\nWe should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.\n\nAnd we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we're cutting down on defense, it makes us more weak. It projects weakness. And when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks, and are allies are less willing to...\n\n[CROSSTALK]\n\nBIDEN: With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: And why is that so?\n\nBIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all...\n\nRADDATZ: Be specific.\n\nBIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the - this lecture on embassy security - the congressman here cut embassy security in much for the embassy security piece.\n\nNumber two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this - this weakness. I - I don't understand what my friend's talking about here.\n\nWe - this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is a guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating - most devastating - the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop (inaudible).\n\nLook, I - I just - I mean, these guys bet against America all\n\nthe time.\n\nRADDATZ: Can we talk - let me go back to Libya.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah, sure.\n\nRADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why - why\n\nwere people talking about protests? When people in the consulate\n\nfirst saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters.\n\nWhy did that go on (inaudible)?\n\nBIDEN: Because that was exactly what we were told by the\n\nintelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As\n\nthey learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed\n\ntheir assessment. That's why there's also an investigation headed by\n\nTom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing\n\nan investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the\n\nlapses were, so that they will never happen again.\n\nRADDATZ: And they wanted more security there.\n\nBIDEN: Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there.\n\nWe did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at\n\nthe time we were told exactly - we said exactly what the intelligence\n\ncommunity told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as\n\nthe intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they\n\nchanged their view.\n\nThat's why I said we will get to the bottom of this. You know,\n\nusually when there's a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as\n\na nation. But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the\n\nambassador, the governor was holding a press conference - was holding\n\na press conference. That's not presidential leadership.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about - the Romney\n\ncampaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called called\n\n\"No Apologies.\" Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning\n\nKorans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines\n\nurinating on Taliban corpses?\n\nRYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we\n\nshould not apologize for...\n\nRADDATZ: Burning Korans, immediately?\n\nRYAN: What - what we should not be apologizing for are standing\n\nup for our values. What we should not be doing is saying to the\n\nEgyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on them, that he's a\n\ngood guy and, in the next week, say he ought to go.\n\nWhat we should not be doing is rejecting claims for - for calls\n\nfor more security in our barracks, in our Marine - we need Marines in\n\nBenghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for\n\nsecurity. There were requests for extra security; those requests were\n\nnot honored.\n\nLook, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It was Libya, a country\n\nwe knew we had Al Qaida cells there, as we know Al Qaida and its\n\naffiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa. And we did not give\n\nour ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment?\n\nOf course there's an investigation, so we can make sure that this\n\nnever happens again, but when it comes to speaking up for our values,\n\nwe should not apologize for those. Here's the problem. Look at all\n\nthe various issues out there, and it's unraveling before our eyes.\n\nThe vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got - we've\n\nhad four...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to Iran. I'd actually like to move to Iran,\n\nbecause there's really no bigger national security...\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nRADDATZ: ... this country is facing. Both President Obama and\n\nGovernor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a\n\nnuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week, former\n\nDefense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran's facilities would\n\nnot work and, quote, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for\n\ngenerations.\" Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to\n\nthe American people how effective would a military strike be?\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.\n\nNow, let's take a look at where we've gone - come from. When Barack\n\nObama was elected, they had enough fissile material - nuclear\n\nmaterial to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They're\n\nracing toward a nuclear weapon. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapons capability.\n\nWe've had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from\n\nthe Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is\n\nbecause Russia watered it down and prevented the - the sanctions from\n\nhitting the central bank.\n\nMitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I've\n\nbeen fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was\n\nblocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong\n\nbipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule\n\ntheir objections and put them in spite of the administration.\n\nImagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in\n\nplace earlier. You think Iran's not brazen? Look at what they're\n\ndoing. They're stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a\n\nterrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to\n\nblow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd talk about credibility? When this administration says that\n\nall options are on the table, they send out senior administration\n\nofficials that send all these mixed signals.\n\nAnd so, in order to solve this peacefully - which is everybody's\n\ngoal - you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at\n\nwhere they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's\n\nbecause this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's\n\nbecause this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions,\n\ntried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place.\n\nNow we have them in place because of Congress. They say the\n\nmilitary option's on the table, but it's not being viewed as credible.\n\nAnd the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have\n\ncredibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility\n\non this issue.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: It's incredible. Look, imagine had we let the Republican\n\nCongress work out the sanctions. You think there's any possibility\n\nthe entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our\n\nallies? These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of\n\nsanctions, period. Period.\n\nthese sanctions.\" When he said, \"Well, you're talking about doing\n\nmore,\" what are you - you're going to go to war? Is that what you\n\nwant to do?\n\nRYAN: We want to prevent war.\n\nBIDEN: And the interesting thing is, how are they going to\n\nprevent war? How are they going to prevent war if they say there's\n\nnothing more that we - that they say we should do than what we've\n\nalready done, number one.\n\nAnd number two, with regard to the ability of the United States\n\nto take action militarily, it is - it is not in my purview to talk\n\nabout classified information. But we feel quite confident we could\n\ndeal a serious blow to the Iranians.\n\nBut number two, the Iranians are - the Israelis and the United\n\nStates, our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the\n\nsame exact place in terms of how close - how close the Iranians are\n\nto getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no\n\ndifference between our view and theirs.\n\nWhen my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take\n\nthis highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they\n\nhave to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon\n\nthat the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know\n\n- we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon.\n\nSo all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk, what are\n\nthey talking about? Are you talking about, to be more credible -\n\nwhat more can the president do, stand before the United Nations, tell\n\nthe whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah, we will not\n\nlet them acquire a nuclear weapon, period, unless he's talking about\n\ngoing to war.\n\nRYAN: Martha? Let's...\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What\n\ndo they see? They see this administration trying to water down\n\nsanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster\n\ntoward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster.\n\nThey see us saying when we come into the administration, when\n\nthey're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see\n\nPresident Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and\n\nhe, instead of meeting with him, goes on a - on a daily talk show.\n\nThey see, when we say that these options are on the table, the\n\nsecretary of defense walked them back.\n\nThey are not changing their mind. That's what we have to do, is\n\nchange their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they're\n\ngoing faster.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do it so quickly? Look, you - you both saw\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb with a red line and\n\ntalking about the red line being in spring. So can you solve this, if\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two months\n\nbefore spring and avoid nuclear - nuclear...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We can debate a time line. We can debate the time line,\n\nwhether there's - it's that short a time or longer. I agree that\n\nit's probably longer.\n\nNumber two, it's all about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You don't agree with that bomb and whether the\n\nIsraelis...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: I don't want to go into classified stuff. But we both\n\nagree that to do this peacefully you've got to get them to change\n\ntheir minds. They're not changing their minds. And look at what this\n\nadministration...\n\nRADDATZ: But what - what do...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.\n\nRYAN: You have to have credibility.\n\nBIDEN: The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. The\n\nayatollah sees that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. He\n\nsees the currency going into the tank. He sees the economy going into\n\nfreefall. And he sees the world for the first time totally united in\n\nopposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nNow, with regard to Bibi, who's been my friend 39 years, the\n\npresident has met with Bibi a dozen times. He's spoken to Bibi\n\nNetanyahu as much as he's spoken to anybody. The idea that we're not\n\n- I was in a, just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference\n\ncall with the - with the president, with him talking to Bibi for well\n\nover an hour, in - in - in stark relief and detail of what was going\n\non.\n\nThis is a bunch of stuff. Look, here's the deal.\n\nRADDATZ: What does that mean, a bunch of stuff?\n\nBIDEN: Well, it means it's simply inaccurate.\n\nRYAN: It's Irish.\n\nBIDEN: It - it is.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe Irish call it malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: We Irish call it malarkey. But last thing. The\n\nsecretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didn't walk\n\nanything back. We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear\n\nweapon. What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where\n\nthey can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon. They don't have\n\na weapon to put it into.\n\nLet's all calm down a little bit here. Iran is more isolated\n\ntoday than when we took office. It was on the ascendancy when we took\n\noffice. It is totally isolated.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know what world this guy's living in.\n\nRYAN: Thank heavens we had these sanctions in place. It's in\n\nspite of their opposition.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, god.\n\nRYAN: They've given 20 waivers to this sanction. And all I have\n\nto point to are the results. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapon. I think that case speaks for itself.\n\nRADDATZ: Can you tell the American people...\n\nBIDEN: By the way, they...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: What's worse, another war in the Middle East...\n\nBIDEN: ... they are not four years closer to a nuclear weapon.\n\nRYAN: Of course they are.\n\nBIDEN: They're - they're closer to being able to get enough\n\nfissile material to put in a weapon if they had a weapon.\n\nRADDATZ: You are acting a little bit like they don't want one.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, I didn't say - no, I'm not saying that. But facts\n\nmatter, Martha. You're a foreign policy expert. Facts matter. All\n\nthis loose talk about them, \"All they have to do is get to enrich\n\nuranium in a certain amount and they have a weapon,\" not true. Not\n\ntrue.\n\nThey are more - and if we ever have to take action, unlike when\n\nwe took office, we will have the world behind us, and that matters.\n\nThat matters.\n\nRADDATZ: What about Bob Gates' statement? Let me read that\n\nagain, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.\"\n\nBIDEN: He is right. It could prove catastrophic, if we didn't\n\ndo it with precision.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: And what it does is it undermines our credibility by\n\nbacking up the point when we make it that all options are on the\n\ntable. That's the point. The ayatollahs see these kinds of\n\nstatements and they think, \"I'm going to get a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nWhen - when we see the kind of equivocation that took place\n\nbecause this administration wanted a precondition policy, so when the\n\nGreen Revolution started up, they were silent for nine days. When\n\nthey see us putting - when they see us putting daylight between\n\nourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.\n\nWhen they see Russia watering down any further sanctions, the only\n\nreason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down and\n\nprevented these central bank sanctions in the first place. So when\n\nthey see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue, and\n\nthat's the problem.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let me tell you what Russia...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let me ask you what's worse, war in the Middle\n\nEast, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?\n\nRYAN: I'll tell you what's worse. I'll tell you what's worse.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly.\n\nRYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran which triggers a nuclear arms race in\n\nthe Middle East. This is the world's largest sponsor of - of\n\nterrorism. They've dedicated themselves...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... to wiping an entire country off the map. They call us\n\nthe Great Satan. And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the\n\nneighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons, as well.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nRYAN: We can't live with that.\n\nBIDEN: War should always be the absolute last resort. That's\n\nwhy these crippling sanctions, which Bibi Netanyahu says we should\n\ncontinue, which - if I'm not mistaken - Governor Romney says we -\n\nwe should continue. I may be mistaken. He changes his mind so often,\n\nI could be wrong.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, he says they're working. And the\n\nfact is that they are being crippled by them. And we've made it\n\nclear, big nations can't bluff. This president doesn't bluff.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a\n\ndifferent kind of national security issue, the state of our economy.\n\nThe number-one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of\n\nunemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months.\n\nThe Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6\n\npercent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in\n\nstimulus money.\n\nSo will both of you level with the American people: Can you get\n\nunemployment to under 6 percent and how long will it take?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know how long it will take. We can and we will\n\nget it under 6 percent. Let's look at - let's take a look at the\n\nfacts. Let's look at where we were when we came to office. The\n\neconomy was in free fall. We had - the great recession hit; 9\n\nmillion people lost their job; $1.7 - $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in\n\nequity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class.\n\nWe knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went\n\nout and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we\n\ncut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that -\n\nwhen that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, \"No, let Detroit\n\ngo bankrupt.\" We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.\n\nGovernor Romney said, \"No, let foreclosures hit the bottom.\"\n\nBut it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of\n\nthe American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own\n\nlives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said \"30 percent\n\nof the American people are takers.\"\n\nThese people are my mom and dad - the people I grew up with, my\n\nneighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in\n\nhis federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are\n\nliving off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting\n\nin Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \"not paying any tax.\"\n\nI've had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent - it's\n\nabout time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing\n\npledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to\n\ncontribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a\n\npledge saying to the middle class we're going to level the playing\n\nfield; we're going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not\n\nrepeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of\n\nrules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to\n\nhemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy.\n\nBIDEN: They're pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will\n\ngive an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And\n\nthey're holding hostage the middle class tax cut because they say we\n\nwon't pass - we won't continue the middle class tax cut unless you\n\ngive the tax cut for the super wealthy.\n\nIt's about time they take some responsibility.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns. He's from Scranton,\n\nPennsylvania. I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what the\n\nunemployment rate in Scranton is today?\n\nBIDEN: I sure do.\n\nRYAN: It's 10 percent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: You know what it was the day you guys came in - 8.5\n\npercent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: That's how it's going all around America.\n\nLook...\n\nBIDEN: You don't read the statistics. That's not how it's\n\ngoing. It's going down.\n\nRADDATZ: (inaudible) two-minute answer (inaudible)\n\nRYAN: Look, did they come in and inherit a tough situation?\n\nAbsolutely. But we're going in the wrong direction. Look at where we\n\nare. The economy is barely limping along. It's growing a 1.3\n\npercent. That's slower than it grew last year and last year was\n\nslower than the year before.\n\nJob growth in September was slower than it was in August, and\n\nAugust was slower than it was in July. We're heading in the wrong\n\ndirection; 23 million Americans are struggling for work today; 15\n\npercent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a\n\nreal recovery looks like.\n\nWe need real reforms for real recovery and that's exactly what\n\nMitt Romney and I are proposing. It's a five-point plan. Get America\n\nenergy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help\n\npeople who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they\n\nwant. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt\n\ncrisis.\n\nMake trade work for America so we can make more things in America\n\nand sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. Don't raise\n\ntaxes on small businesses because they're our job creators.\n\nRYAN: He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney's a car guy. They\n\nkeep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.\n\nThis is a guy who I was talking to a family in Northborough,\n\nMassachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark Nixon. Their kids were\n\nhit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them, Rob and Reed, were\n\nparalyzed. The Romneys didn't know them. They went to the same\n\nchurch; they never met before.\n\nboys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, \"I know you're\n\nstruggling, Mark. Don't worry about their college. I'll pay for it.\"\n\nWhen Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney\n\ndoesn't tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told\n\nme this story, he said it wasn't the help, the cash help. It's that\n\nhe gave his time, and he has consistently.\n\nThis is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more\n\nthan the two of us combined. Mitt Romney's a good man. He cares\n\nabout 100 percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to\n\nthat quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes\n\nthe words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBIDEN: But I always say what I mean. And so does Romney.\n\nRYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We want to get people out\n\nof poverty, in the middle class, onto a life of self-sufficiently. We\n\nbelieve in opportunity and upward mobility. That's what we're going\n\nto push for in a Romney administration.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice president? I have a feeling you have a few things\n\nto say here.\n\nBIDEN: The idea - if you heard that - that little soliloquy on\n\n47 percent and you think he just made a mistake, then I think you're\n\n- I - I think - I got a bridge to sell you.\n\nLook, I don't doubt his personal generosity. And I understand\n\nwhat it's like. When I was a little younger than the congressman, my\n\nwife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife, and my two\n\nsons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone\n\nthrough what I get through, because the one thing you can give people\n\nsolace is to know if they know you've been through it, that they can\n\nmake it. So I don't doubt his personal commitment to individuals.\n\nBut you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile\n\nindustry. He just - he said, let it go bankrupt, period. Let it\n\ndrop out. All this talk - we saved a million jobs. Two hundred\n\nthousand people are working today.\n\nAnd I've never met two guys who're more down on America across\n\nthe board. We're told everything's going bad. There are 5.2 million\n\nnew jobs, private-sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million - if\n\nthey'd get out of the way, if they'd get out of the way and let us\n\npass the tax cut for the middle class, make it permanent, if they get\n\nout of the way and pass the - pass the jobs bill, if they get out of\n\nthe way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay\n\nin their homes because their mortgages are upside down, but they never\n\nmissed a mortgage payment, just get out of the way.\n\nStop talking about how you care about people. Show me something.\n\nShow me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility.\n\nAnd, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell\n\nout of the sky, like, \"Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?\" It\n\ncame from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the\n\nsame time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a\n\ntrillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there. I voted\n\nagainst them. I said, no, we can't afford that.\n\nAnd now, all of a sudden, these guys are so seized with the\n\nconcern about the debt that they created.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's not forget that they came in with one-party control.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything. They\n\nhad the ability to do everything of their choosing. And look at where\n\nwe are right now.\n\nThey passed the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831\n\nbillion, spend it on all of these special interest groups, and that it\n\nwould work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8\n\npercent - it went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that,\n\nright now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy would grow at\n\n4 percent. It's growing at 1.3.\n\nRADDATZ: When could you get it below 6 percent?\n\nRYAN: That's what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan for\n\na stronger middle class is all about: getting the economy growing at\n\n4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over the next four years.\n\nLook at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was\n\nin charge of overseeing this. $90 billion in green pork to campaign\n\ncontributors and special interest groups. There are just at the\n\nDepartment of Energy over 100 criminal investigations that have been\n\nlaunched into just how stimulus...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRADDATZ: Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague...\n\nRYAN: Crony capitalism and corporate welfare.\n\nBIDEN: ... runs an investigative committee, spent months and\n\nmonths and months going into this.\n\nRYAN: This is the - this is the inspector general.\n\nBIDEN: Months and months. They found no evidence of cronyism.\n\nAnd I love my friend here. I - I'm not allowed to show letters\n\nbut go on our website, he sent me two letters saying, \"By the way, can\n\nyou send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of\n\nWisconsin?\" We sent millions of dollars. You know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money, correct?\n\nBIDEN: Sure he did. By the way...\n\nRYAN: On two occasions we - we - we advocated for constituents\n\nwho were applying for grants. That's what we do. We do that for all\n\nconstituents who are...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: I love that. I love that. This was such a bad program\n\nand he writes me a letter saying - writes the Department of Energy a\n\nletter saying, \"The reason we need this stimulus, it will create\n\ngrowth and jobs.\" His words. And now he's sitting here looking at\n\nme.\n\nAnd by the way, that program, again, investigated. What the\n\nCongress said was it was a model. Less than four-tenths of 1 percent\n\nwaste or fraud in the program.\n\nAnd all this talk about cronyism. They investigated and\n\ninvestigated, did not find one single piece of evidence. I wish he\n\nwould just tell - be a little more candid.\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric\n\ncars in Finland, or on windmills in China?\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries\n\nlike China and spend it on all these various different interest\n\ngroups?\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what was a good idea. It was a good\n\nidea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to\n\nstop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able\n\nto grow again. We have, in fact, 4 percent of those green jobs didn't\n\ngo under - went under, didn't work. It's a better batting average\n\nthan investment bankers have. They have about a 40 percent...\n\nRYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being...\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements. I\n\nthink we've gone over this quite enough.\n\nBIDEN: By the way, any letter you send me, I'll entertain.\n\nRYAN: I appreciate that, Joe.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements. Both\n\nMedicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share\n\nof the budget in the process.\n\nWill benefits for Americans under these programs have to change\n\nfor the programs to survive?\n\nMr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going\n\nbankrupt. These are indisputable facts.\n\nLook, when I look at these programs, we've all had tragedies in\n\nour lives. I think about what they've done for my own family. My mom\n\nand I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer's.\n\nMedicare was there for here, just like it's there for my mom right now\n\nwho is a Florida senior.\n\nAfter my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors\n\nbenefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college\n\nin her 50s where she started a small business because of the new\n\nskills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these\n\nprograms would be there for her.\n\nWe will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform\n\nit for my generation.\n\nYou see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people\n\n54 and below, you can guarantee they don't change for people in or\n\nnear retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are\n\nproposing.\n\nLook what - look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716\n\nbillion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief\n\nactuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can't spend the same\n\ndollar twice. You can't claim that this money goes to Medicare and\n\nObamacare.\n\nRYAN: And then they put this new Obamacare board in charge of\n\ncutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied\n\ncare for current seniors.\n\nThis board, by the way, it's 15 people, the president's supposed\n\nto appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have\n\nmedical training.\n\nAnd Social Security? If we don't shore up Social Security, when\n\nwe run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent\n\nacross-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle\n\nof their retirement. We're going to stop that from happening.\n\nThey haven't put a credible solution on the table. He'll tell\n\nyou about vouchers. He'll say all these things to try and scare\n\npeople. Here's what we're saying: give younger people, when they\n\nbecome Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can't\n\nbe denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then\n\nMedicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people,\n\nmore coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket\n\ncoverage for the poor and the sick.\n\nChoice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future\n\nseniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of\n\n15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah\n\nPalin. It seems every vice presidential debate I hear this kind of\n\nstuff about panels.\n\nBut let's talk about Medicare. What we did is, we saved $716\n\nbillion and put it back, applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of\n\nMedicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies, doctors and\n\nhospitals. The AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did.\n\nAnd it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this\n\nall out.\n\nIt also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself:\n\nDo you have more benefits today? You do. If you're near the donut\n\nhole, you have $800 - $600 more to help your prescription drug costs.\n\nYou get wellness visits without co-pays. They wipe all of this out,\n\nand Medicare goes - becomes insolvent in 2016, number one.\n\nNumber two, \"guaranteed benefit\"? It's a voucher. When they\n\nfirst proposed - when the congressman had his first voucher program,\n\nthe CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every\n\nsenior, 55 and below, when they got there. He knew that, yet he got\n\nall the guys in Congress and women in the Republican Party to vote for\n\nit. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it, were I\n\nthere.\n\nWho you believe, the AMA, me, a guy who's fought his whole life\n\nfor this, or somebody who would actually put in motion a plan that\n\nknowingly cut - added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?\n\nNow they got a new plan: \"Trust me, it's not going to cost you\n\nany more.\" Folks, follow your instincts on this one.\n\nAnd with regard to Social Security, we will not - we will not\n\nprivatize it. If we had listened to Romney, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors\n\nwould be now if their money had been in the market.\n\nTheir ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate\n\nthe guarantee of Medicare.\n\nRYAN: Here's the problem. They got caught with their hands in\n\nthe cookie jar, turning Medicare into a piggybank for Obamacare.\n\nTheir own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said\n\none out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of\n\nbusiness as a result of this.\n\nBIDEN: That's not what they said.\n\nRYAN: 7.4 million seniors are projected to lose their current\n\nMedicare Advantage coverage they have. That's a $3,200 benefit cut.\n\nBIDEN: That didn't happen.\n\nRYAN: What we're saying...\n\nBIDEN: More people signed up.\n\nRYAN: These are from your own actuaries.\n\nBIDEN: More - more - more people signed up for Medicare\n\nAdvantage after the change.\n\nRYAN: What - there's...\n\nBIDEN: Nobody is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know...\n\nBIDEN: No, this is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress to\n\nmake up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if\n\nwe don't keep interrupting each other.\n\nBIDEN: Well, don't take all the four minutes then.\n\nRYAN: Let me just - let me just say this. We are not - we're\n\nsaying don't change benefits for people 55 and above. They already\n\norganized their retirement around these promises.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... programs for those of us.\n\nRADDATZ: But let - let me ask you this. What - what is your\n\nspecific plan for seniors who really can't afford to make up the\n\ndifference in the value of what you call a premium support plan and\n\nothers call a voucher?\n\nRYAN: Hundred percent coverage...\n\nRADDATZ: And what...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's what we're saying. So we're saying...\n\nRADDATZ: How do you make that up?\n\nRYAN: ... income adjusts (inaudible) these premium support\n\npayments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.\n\nLook, this is a plan - by the way, that $6,400 number, it was\n\nmisleading then, it's totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that's\n\nbipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat\n\nsenator from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: There's not one Democrat who endorses it.\n\nRYAN: It's a plan...\n\nBIDEN: Not one Democrat who (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: We - we - we put it - we put it together with the\n\nformer Clinton budget director.\n\nBIDEN: Who disavows it.\n\nRYAN: This idea - this idea came from the Clinton commission to\n\nsave Medicare chaired by Senator John Breaux.\n\nHere's the point, Martha.\n\nBIDEN: Which was rejected.\n\nRYAN: If we don't - if we don't fix this problem pretty soon\n\nthen current seniors get cut. Here's the problem: 10,000 people are\n\nretiring every single day in America today and they will for 20 years.\n\nThat's not a political thing, that's a math thing.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just - if they\n\njust allowed Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid\n\ncan, that would save $156 billion right off the bat.\n\nRYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.\n\nBIDEN: All - all - all...\n\nRYAN: It has a restricted...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Seniors are not denied.\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nBIDEN: They are not denied.\n\nLook, folks, all you seniors out there, have you been denied\n\nchoices? Have you lost Medicare Advantage.\n\nRYAN: Because it's working well right now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Because we've changed the law.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help\n\nsolve the problem, why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility\n\nage by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?\n\nBIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security\n\nin 1983. I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included\n\nTip O'Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together\n\nand everybody said, as long as everybody's in the deal, everybody's in\n\nthe deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.\n\nWe made the system solvent to 2033. We will not, though, be part\n\nof any voucher plan eliminating - the voucher says, \"Mom, when you're\n\n- when you're 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can\n\nget. You're out of Medicare.\"\n\nYou can buy back in if you want with this voucher, which will not\n\nkeep pace - will not keep pace with health care costs. Because if it\n\ndid keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings.\n\nThat's why they go the voucher. They - we will be no part of a\n\nvoucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\n\nRYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check, and buy\n\nsomething. Nobody's proposing that. Barack Obama four years ago\n\nrunning for president said if you don't have any fresh ideas, use\n\nstale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a good record to run\n\non, paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Make a big election about small ideas.\n\nRADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with\n\nPresident Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social\n\nSecurity.\n\nRYAN: For younger people. What we said then, and what I've\n\nalways agreed is let younger Americans have a voluntary choice of\n\nmaking their money work faster for them within the Social Security\n\nsystem.\n\nBIDEN: You saw how well that worked.\n\nRYAN: That's not what Mitt Romney's proposing. What we're\n\nsaying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.\n\nBIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing...\n\nRYAN: And then the kinds of changes we're talking about for\n\nyounger people like myself is don't increase the benefits for wealthy\n\npeople as fast as everybody else. Slowly raise the retirement age\n\nover time.\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRYAN: It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103\n\naccording to the actuaries.\n\nNow, here's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President?\n\nBIDEN: Quickly. The bottom line here is that all the studies\n\nshow that if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt\n\nRomney, if you're 40 - in your 40s now you will pay $2,600 a year -\n\nyou get $2,600 a year less in Social Security. If you're in your 20s\n\nnow, you get $4,700 (inaudible) less.\n\nThe idea of changing, and change being in this case to cut the\n\nbenefits for people without taking other action you could do to make\n\nit work is absolutely the wrong way.\n\nThese - look, these guys haven't been big on Medicare from the\n\nbeginning. Their party's not been big on Medicare from the beginning.\n\nAnd they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do.\n\nLook, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this -\n\na man who introduced a bill that would raise it 40 - $6,400 a year;\n\nknowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he'd sign it, or me and\n\nthe president?\n\nRYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more\n\nimportantly...\n\nBIDEN: That's - there are the facts right...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: This is what politicians do when they don't have a record\n\nto run on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don't get\n\nahead of this problem, it's going to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries - there are more beneficiaries...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to move...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: ... very simple question...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're not going to run away. Medicare and Social Security\n\ndid so much for my own family. We are not going to jeopardize this\n\nprogram, but we have to save it...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: You are jeopardizing this program. You're changing the\n\nprogram from a guaranteed benefit to premium support. Whatever you\n\ncall it, the bottom line is people are going to have to pay more money\n\nout of their pocket and the families I know and the families I come\n\nfrom, they don't have the money to pay more out...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's why we're saying more for lower income people and\n\nless for higher income people.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I would like to move on to a very simple\n\nquestion for both of you, and something tells me I won't get a very\n\nsimple answer, but let me ask you this.\n\nBIDEN: I gave you a simple answer. He's raising the cost of\n\nMedicare.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will\n\npay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we're starting with Vice\n\nPresident Biden for two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: The middle class will pay less and people making $1\n\nmillion or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give\n\nyou one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts - we\n\nare arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed\n\nto expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million -\n\nbillion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million.\n\nWe see no justification in these economic times for those, and\n\nthey're patriotic Americans. They're not asking for this continued\n\ntax cut. They're not suggesting it, but my friends are insisting on\n\nit; 120,000 families by continuing that tax cut will get an additional\n\n$500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years and their income is an\n\naverage of $8 million.\n\nWe want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -\n\npermanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won't\n\nallow us to. You know what they're saying? We say \"let's have a vote\n\n- let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and let's have a vote\n\non the upper (ph) tax cut; let's go ahead and vote on it.\"\n\nThey're saying no. They're holding hostage the middle class tax\n\ncut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, they've got another tax\n\ncut coming that's $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will\n\nin fact give another $250 million - yeah, $250,000 a year to those\n\n120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle income with\n\na child by $2,000 a year.\n\nThis is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle\n\nclass got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them.\n\nThey need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000\n\nfamilies for another - another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10\n\nyears.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman?\n\nRYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow\n\nthe economy and create jobs. It's a plan that's estimated to create 7\n\nmillion jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a\n\nfamily and business's income is enough. President Obama thinks that\n\nthe government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a\n\nsmall business's income.\n\nRYAN: Look, if you taxed every person and successful business\n\nmaking over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government\n\nfor 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including\n\nsuccessful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year,\n\nwe'd still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren't enough\n\nrich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending.\n\nAnd so the next time you hear them say, \"Don't worry about it,\n\nwe'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,\" watch out,\n\nmiddle class, the tax bill's coming to you.\n\nThat's why we're saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let's\n\ntake a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file\n\ntheir taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come\n\nfrom, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped\n\ntheir tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in\n\nthe industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the\n\ntop effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40\n\npercent.\n\nTwo-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax\n\nwould actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It's\n\nexpected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn't even\n\npay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases.\n\nWhat we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close\n\nloopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three\n\nbottom lines: Don't raise the deficit, don't raise taxes on the\n\nmiddle class, and don't lower the share of income that is borne by the\n\nhigh-income earners.\n\nHe'll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose. It's been\n\ndiscredited by six other studies. And even their own deputy campaign\n\nmanager acknowledged that it wasn't correct.\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let's talk about this 20 percent. You have\n\nrefused - and, again - to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20\n\npercent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics?\n\nOr are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters?\n\nRYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to\n\nhave big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the...\n\nRADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That would - that would be a first for the Republican\n\nCongress.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you know exactly what you're doing?\n\nRYAN: Look - look at what Mitt Romney - look at what Ronald\n\nReagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework\n\nto lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to\n\nfix that.\n\nWhat we're saying is, here's our framework. Lower tax rates 20\n\npercent. We raised about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We\n\nforego about $1.1 trillion in loopholes and deductions. And so what\n\nwe're saying is, deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income\n\ntaxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader\n\nbase of taxation...\n\nBIDEN: Can I translate?\n\nRYAN: ... so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now,\n\nhere's why I'm saying this. What we're saying is, here's the\n\nframework...\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this.\n\nRADDATZ: You'll get time.\n\nRYAN: We want to work with Congress - we want to work with the\n\nCongress on how best to achieve this. That means successful. Look...\n\nRADDATZ: No specifics, again.\n\nRYAN: Mitt - what we're saying is, lower tax rates 20 percent,\n\nstart with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it...\n\nRADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed - six studies\n\nhave verified that this math adds up. But here's...\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: .. let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.\n\nRYAN: I'll come back in a second, then, right?\n\nBIDEN: First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks\n\n- he gave specifics of what he was going to cut, number one, in terms\n\nof tax expenditures. Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses\n\nin America pay less - make less than $250,000.\n\nLet me tell you who some of those other small businesses are:\n\nhedge funds that make $600 million, $800 million a year. That's -\n\nthat's what they count as small businesses, because they're pass-\n\nthrough.\n\nLet's look at how sincere they are. Ronald - I mean, excuse me,\n\nGovernor Romney on \"60 Minutes\" - I guess it was about 10 days ago -\n\nmaking $50,000 pays more than that. Do you think that's fair?\" He\n\nsaid, \"Oh, yes, that's fair. That's fair.\"\n\nThis is - and they're going to talk - you think these guys are\n\ngoing to go out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole - the\n\nbiggest loophole they take advantage of is the carried interest\n\nloophole and - and capital gains loophole. They exempt that.\n\nBIDEN: Now, there's not enough - the reason why the AEI study,\n\nthe American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center study,\n\nthe reason they all say it's going - taxes go up on the middle class,\n\nthe only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage\n\ndeduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction,\n\nmiddle-class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to\n\nsend their kids to college. That's why they arrive at it.\n\nRADDATZ: Is he wrong about that?\n\nRYAN: He is wrong about that. They're...\n\nBIDEN: How's that?\n\nRYAN: You can - you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still\n\npreserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers...\n\nBIDEN: Not mathematically possible.\n\nRYAN: It is mathematically possible. It's been done before.\n\nIt's precisely what we're proposing.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: It's been done a couple of times, actually.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald\n\nReagan...\n\nBIDEN: Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRYAN: Ronald Reagan - Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: This is amazing.\n\nRYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.\n\nBIDEN: That's right.\n\nRYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren't used to doing\n\nbipartisan deals...\n\nBIDEN: But we told each other what we're going to do.\n\nRYAN: Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here - here are the\n\nthings we're going to cut.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's what we said.\n\nRYAN: We said here's the framework, let's work together to fill\n\nin the details. That's exactly...\n\nBIDEN: Fill in the detail.\n\nRYAN: That's how you get things done. You work with Congress -\n\nlook, let me say it this way.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's coming from a Republican Congress working\n\nbipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.\n\nRYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87\n\npercent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn't\n\ndemonize them. He didn't demagogue them. He met with those party\n\nleaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn't\n\ncompromise principles.\n\nBIDEN: And you saw what happened.\n\nRYAN: He found common ground - and he balanced the budget...\n\nBIDEN: You saw - if he did such a great job...\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... four times without raising taxes...\n\nBIDEN: Why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President, what would you suggest - what\n\nwould you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would\n\nsubstantially reduce the long-term deficit?\n\nBIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they're supposed to on\n\nthose millionaires. We don't - we can't afford $800 billion going to\n\npeople making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha.\n\nThose 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people\n\nneed the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for\n\nthem? Why does he go after the childcare...\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nBIDEN: Why do they do that?\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nRYAN: Yeah, we're saying close loopholes...\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: ... on high-interest people.\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: For higher-income people. Here...\n\nBIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000\n\nwill have a mortgage - their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?\n\nRYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to\n\nmake you think that it's just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an\n\nactor...\n\nBIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less\n\nthan $250,000 a year, would not be affected.\n\nRYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million - this taxes a million\n\npeople, a million small businesses.\n\nBIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?\n\nRYAN: It taxes a million small businesses...\n\nBIDEN: Small businesses?\n\nRYAN: ... who are our greatest job creators.\n\nBIDEN: I wish I'd get - the \"greatest job creators\" are the\n\nhedge fund guys.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're - and you're going to increase the defense\n\nbudget.\n\nRYAN: Think about it this way.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're going to increase the defense budget.\n\nRYAN: No, we're not just going to cut the defense budget like\n\nthey're - they're proposing...\n\nBIDEN: They're going to increase it $2 billion.\n\nRYAN: That's not...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're talking about...\n\nRADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?\n\nRYAN: No, we're saying don't - OK, you want to get into defense\n\nnow?\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that's another math question.\n\nRYAN: So - right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do that?\n\nRYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin\n\nwith. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that's lurking\n\non the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the\n\ndebt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?\n\nRYAN: Right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put those aside. No one wants that.\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to go back to that.\n\nRADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this\n\nincrease in defense spending?\n\nBIDEN: Two trillion dollars.\n\nRYAN: You don't cut defense by a trillion dollars. That's what\n\nwe're talking about.\n\nRADDATZ: And what - what national security issues justify an\n\nincrease?\n\nBIDEN: Who's cutting it by $1 trillion?\n\nRYAN: We're going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120\n\ncargo planes. We're going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out...\n\nRADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war...\n\nRYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest -\n\nthe smallest it has been since before World War I.\n\nThis invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through\n\nstrength? You bet we do. And that means you don't impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military.\n\nSo we're saying don't cut the military by a trillion dollars.\n\nNot increase it by a trillion, don't cut it by a trillion dollars.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move\n\non.\n\nBIDEN: Look, we don't cut it. And I might add, this so-called\n\n- I know we don't want to use the fancy word \"sequester,\" this\n\nAnd let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference\n\nannouncing his support of the deal. He said, and I'm paraphrase,\n\nWe've been looking for this moment for a long time.\n\nRYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.\n\nBIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the\n\nautomatic cuts in defense if they didn't act.\n\nsays we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we\n\nneed - we don't need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs.\n\nRADDATZ: Some of the military.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Not some of the military. That was the decision of the\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the\n\npresident. That is a fact.\n\nRADDATZ: Who answers to a civilian leader.\n\nBIDEN: They made the recommendation first.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Let's move on to Afghanistan.\n\nRYAN: Can I get into that for a second?\n\nRADDATZ: I'd like to move on to Afghanistan please. And that's\n\none of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars, and\n\nmore importantly in lives.\n\nWe just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops\n\nthere in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the\n\nvery Afghan forces we are trying to help.\n\nNow, we've reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces, we've\n\ndegraded Al Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we\n\nreally accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten. We want to\n\nmake sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give Al Qaida a\n\nsafe haven.\n\nWe agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.\n\nLook, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the\n\nincredible job that our troops have done. You've been there more than\n\nthe two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was\n\namazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph)\n\nValley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private\n\nin the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell\n\nme what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had\n\nin front of them.\n\nAnd then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand\n\nwith the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it's nothing\n\nshort of amazing.\n\nWhat we don't want to do is lose the gains we've gotten. Now,\n\nwe've disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have\n\nmore likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our\n\ncommanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels\n\nthroughout this year's fighting season. We've been skeptical about\n\nnegotiations with the Taliban, especially while they're shooting at\n\nus.\n\nBut we want to see the 2014 transition be successful, and that\n\nmeans we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make\n\nsure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a\n\nlaunching pad for terrorists.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let's keep our eye on the ball. The reason -\n\nI've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times. I've been up\n\nin the Konar (ph) Valley. I've been throughout that whole country,\n\nmostly in a helicopter, and sometimes in a vehicle.\n\nThe fact is, we went there for one reason: to get those people\n\nwho killed Americans, Al Qaida. We've decimated Al Qaida central. We\n\nhave eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.\n\nAnd, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would\n\nhelp train the Afghan military. It's their responsibility to take\n\nover their own security. That's why with 49 of our allies in\n\nAfghanistan, we've agreed on a gradual drawdown so we're out of there\n\nby the year 20 - in the year 2014.\n\nMy friend and the governor say it's based on conditions, which\n\nmeans it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the\n\nresponsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We\n\nhave trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been\n\nmore than two dozen cases of green-on-blue where Americans have been\n\nkilled. If we do not - if the measures the military has taken do not\n\ntake hold, we will not go on joint patrols. We will not train in the\n\nfield. We'll only train in the - in the Army bases that exist there.\n\nBut we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period. And in the\n\nprocess, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800\n\nbillion. We've been in this war for over a decade. The primary\n\nobjective is almost completed. Now, all we're doing is putting the\n\nKabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own\n\nsecurity.\n\nIt's their responsibility, not America's.\n\nRADDATZ: What - what conditions could justify staying,\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to stay. We want - look, one of my best\n\nfriends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward-operating base in\n\neastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends. Our\n\ndaughters are best friends. I want - I want him and all of our\n\ntroops to come home as soon and safely as possible.\n\nWe want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That's why we want\n\nto make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to\n\nmake it successful. We don't want to extend beyond 2014. That's the\n\npoint we're making.\n\nYou know, if it was just this, I'd feel like we would - we would\n\nbe able to call this a success, but it's not. What we are witnessing\n\nas we turn on our television screens these days is the absolute\n\nunraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home,\n\nbut - problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren't growing here at\n\nhome.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we're absolutely\n\nleaving in 2014. You're saying that's not an absolute, but you won't\n\ntalk about what conditions would justify...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Do you know why we say that?\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies \"put a\n\ndate on your calendar, wait us out, and then come back.\" We want to\n\nmake sure...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline.\n\nRYAN: We do agree - we do agree with the timeline and the\n\ntransition, but what we - what any administration will do in 2013 is\n\nassess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline. What\n\nwe do not want to do...\n\nBIDEN: We will leave in 2014.\n\nRYAN: ... what we don't want to do is give our allies reason to\n\ntrust us less and our enemies more - we don't want to embolden our\n\nenemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha, that's a bizarre statement.\n\nRYAN: That's why we want to make sure - no, that's why we want\n\nto make sure that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine of our allies - hear me - 49 of our allies\n\nsigned on to this position.\n\nRYAN: And we're reading that they want to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine - 49 of our allies said \"out in 2014.\" It's\n\nthe responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Do you really think that this timeline...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Which is - which is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We have - we have soldiers and Marines. We have\n\nAfghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do you\n\nthink, taking advantage of this timeline?\n\nBIDEN: Look, the Taliban - what we've found out, and we - you\n\nsaw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the\n\ncase of Iraq, and - and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not\n\nstep up. They're happy to let us continue to do the job;\n\ninternational security forces to do the job.\n\nThe only way they step up is to say, \"Fellas, we're leaving;\n\nwe've trained you; step up, step up.\"\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back.\n\nBIDEN: That's the only way it works.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to the - the surge troops that we put\n\nin there. And - and you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have\n\ntalked to a lot of troops. I've talked to senior offices who were\n\nconcerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting\n\nseason, and some of them saw that as a political - as a political\n\nmove. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military\n\nreason for bringing those surge troops home...\n\nBIDEN: The military reason...\n\nRADDATZ: ... before the fighting had ended?\n\nBIDEN: ... was bringing - by the way, when the president\n\nannounced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will\n\nbe out by the end of the summer. The military said the surge will be\n\nout. Nothing political about this.\n\nBefore the surge occurred - so you be a little straight with me\n\nhere, too - before the surge occurred, we said they'll be out by the\n\nend of the summer. That's what the military said. The reason for\n\nthat is...\n\nRADDATZ: The military follows orders. I mean, there - trust\n\nme. There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the\n\nfighting season.\n\nBIDEN: Sure. There are people that are concerned, but not the\n\nJoint Chiefs. That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the\n\npresident of the United States of America. I sat there. I'm sure\n\nyou'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I'm positive\n\nyou'll find that within the military. But that's not the case here.\n\nAnd, secondly, the reason why the military said that is, you\n\ncannot wait and have a cliff. It takes - you know - months and\n\nmonths and months to draw down forces.\n\nRYAN: Let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think\n\nthis - it can get a little confusing. We've all met with General\n\nAllen and General Scaparrotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting\n\nseasons.\n\nHere's the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow.\n\nThe Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura\n\ncome over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in\n\nwith snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons.\n\nIn the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes\n\ndown.\n\nAnd so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress\n\nand said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is\n\nend, it puts people more at risk. That's the problem.\n\nYes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month, but the remaining\n\ntroops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute\n\ncounterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people. That makes them\n\nless safe.\n\nBIDEN: Fighting season...\n\nRYAN: We're sending fewer people out in all of these hotspots to\n\ndo the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago.\n\nBIDEN: Because we turned it over...\n\nRYAN: But we took 22,000 people out...\n\nBIDEN: ... we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.\n\nNo one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan\n\npersonnel. And he's - he's conflating two issues. The fighting\n\nseason that Petraeus was talking about and former - and Admiral\n\nMullen was the fighting season this spring. That's what he was\n\ntalking about. We did not - we did not pull them out.\n\nRYAN: The calendar works the same every year.\n\nBIDEN: It does work the same every year. But we're not staying\n\nthere...\n\nRYAN: Spring, summer, fall. It's warm, or it's not. They're\n\nstill fighting us. They're still coming over the passes. They're\n\nstill coming into Zabul, to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are\n\nsending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.\n\nWe've trained them.\n\nRYAN: Not in the east.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move - let's move to another war.\n\nBIDEN: Not in the east?\n\nRYAN: R.C. East - R.C. East...\n\nBIDEN: R.C. East is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nRYAN: That's right. That's why we don't want to send fewer\n\npeople to the...\n\nBIDEN: That's - that's why we should send Americans in to do\n\nthe job, instead of the - you'd rather Americans be going in doing\n\nthe job instead of the trainees?\n\nRYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job, but\n\nfewer of them. That's the whole problem.\n\nBIDEN: That's right. We're sending in more Afghans to do the\n\njob, Afghans to do the job.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria,\n\nwhere there are estimates that more - estimates that more than\n\n25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year,\n\nPresident Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying\n\nit was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres\n\nfrom occurring there. So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Different country. It's a different country. It is five\n\ntimes as large geographically, it has one-fifth the population, that\n\nis Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large\n\ngeographically.\n\nIt's in a part of the world where they're not going to see\n\nwhatever would come from that war. It seep into a regional war.\n\nYou're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the\n\nmost dangerous area in the world. And, in fact, if in fact it blows\n\nup and the wrong people gain control, it's going to have impact on the\n\nentire region causing potentially regional wars.\n\nWe are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the\n\nJordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region\n\nattempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when\n\nAssad goes - and he will go - there will be a legitimate government\n\nthat follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.\n\nAnd all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman, about how we're going to do, we could do so much more in\n\nthere, what more would they do other than put American boots on the\n\nground?\n\nThe last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in\n\nthe Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000\n\nAmerican forces. That - they are the facts. They are the facts.\n\nanything. He - he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he\n\ngets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we\n\nare doing now.\n\nAre they proposing putting American troops on the ground?\n\nPutting American aircraft in the airspace? Is that what they're\n\nproposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so, but that's\n\nnot what they're saying.\n\nWe are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those\n\nforces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not\n\ncause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (sic) - when Bashar Assad\n\nfalls.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria. American\n\ntroops.\n\nNow, let me say it this way. How would we do things differently?\n\nWe wouldn't refer to Bashar Assad as a reformer when he's killing his\n\nown civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldn't be\n\noutsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations giving Vladimir\n\nPutin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue.\n\nHe's vetoed three of them.\n\nHillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do\n\nso. They thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side\n\nof history. She was right about that. This is just one more example\n\nof how the Russia reset's not working.\n\nAnd so where are we? After international pressure mounted, the\n\nPresident Obama said Bashar Assad should go. It's been over a year.\n\nThe man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. And more\n\nforeign fighters are spilling into this country.\n\nSo the longer this has gone on, the more people, groups like Al\n\nQaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the free\n\nSyrian army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks,\n\nthe Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin\n\nwith working through our allies. But, no, we waited for Kofi Annan to\n\ntry and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar\n\nAssad time.\n\nWe gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. And\n\nmeanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.\n\nBIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he\n\nnever answers the question.\n\nRYAN: No, I would - I - we would not be going through the U.N.\n\nin all of these things.\n\nBIDEN: Let me - you don't go through the U.N. We are in the\n\nprocess now - and have been for months - in making sure that help,\n\nhumanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training is getting to\n\nthose forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians\n\nbelieve, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria. That\n\nis underway.\n\nOur allies were all on the same page, NATO, as well as our Arab\n\nallies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea.\n\nWe're the ones that said, \"Enough.\"\n\nWith regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is\n\nthat Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that's\n\nnot in our interest.\n\nRADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall, Congressman Ryan?\n\nWhat happens to the region? What happens if he hangs on? What\n\nhappens if he does?\n\nRYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He's a\n\nsponsor of terrorism. He'll probably continue slaughtering his\n\npeople. We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.\n\nLook, he mentioned the reset...\n\nRADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?\n\nRYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do\n\non chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to\n\nsecure those chemical weapons. They're right about that.\n\nBut what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom\n\nfighters, those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar\n\nAssad a reformer. And...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... we should not have - we should not have waited to\n\nRussia...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... should not have waited for Russia to give us the green\n\nlight at the U.N. to do something about it.\n\nBIDEN: Russia...\n\nRYAN: They're - they're still arming the man. Iran is flying\n\nflights over Iraq...\n\nBIDEN: And the opposition is being armed.\n\nRYAN: ... to help Bashar Assad. And, by the way, if we had the\n\nstatus-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet\n\nhis vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to\n\nprevent that. But he failed to achieve that, as well, again.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me ask you a quick question.\n\nBIDEN: I don't...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria for intervention?\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: In Syria?\n\nRADDATZ: Worldwide.\n\nRYAN: What is in the national interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests?\n\nRYAN: What is in the national security of the American people.\n\nIt's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.\n\nRADDATZ: No humanitarian?\n\nRYAN: Each situation will - will come up with its own set of\n\ncircumstances, but putting American troops on the ground? That's got\n\nto be within the national security interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to - we're - we're almost out of time here.\n\nRYAN: That means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights,\n\nthose are things that don't put American troops on the ground. But if\n\nyou're talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in\n\nour national security interests.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these\n\nlast few questions. This debate is, indeed, historic. We have two\n\nCatholic candidates, first time, on a stage such as this. And I would\n\nlike to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in\n\nyour own personal views on abortion.\n\nPlease talk about how you came to that decision. Talk about how\n\nyour religion played a part in that. And, please, this is such an\n\nemotional issue for so many people in this country...\n\nRYAN: Sure.\n\nRADDATZ: ... please talk personally about this, if you could.\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I don't see how a person can separate their public life\n\nfrom their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in\n\neverything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the\n\nvulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\n\nRYAN: Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life? It's not\n\nsimply because of my Catholic faith. That's a factor, of course. But\n\nit's also because of reason and science.\n\nYou know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I\n\nwent to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven\n\nweek ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A\n\nlittle baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have\n\nnicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \"Bean.\" Now I believe that life\n\nbegins at conception.\n\nThat's why - those are the reasons why I'm pro-life. Now I\n\nunderstand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don't\n\nagree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will\n\nbe to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life\n\nof the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has\n\nhandled all of these issues. Look at what they're doing through\n\nObamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this\n\ncountry. They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of\n\nreligion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches,\n\nCatholic hospitals.\n\nOur church should not have to sue our federal government to\n\nmaintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the\n\nDemocratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and\n\nrare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer\n\nfunding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign\n\naid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he\n\nsympathized and wouldn't second guess their one child policy of forced\n\nabortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: My religion defines who I am, and I've been a practicing\n\nCatholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social\n\ndoctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of\n\nthose who - who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.\n\nWith regard to - with regard to abortion, I accept my church's\n\nposition on abortion as a - what we call a (inaudible) doctrine.\n\nLife begins at conception in the church's judgment. I accept it in my\n\npersonal life.\n\nBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and\n\nMuslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike\n\nmy friend here, the - the congressman. I - I do not believe that we\n\nhave a right to tell other people that - women they can't control\n\ntheir body. It's a decision between them and their doctor. In my\n\nview and the Supreme Court, I'm not going to interfere with that.\n\nWith regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it\n\nabsolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,\n\nincluding Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy\n\nHospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none\n\nhas to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get\n\ncontraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\n\nThat is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the - we\n\ndiffer, my friend says that he - well I guess he accepts Governor\n\nRomney's position now, because in the past he has argued that there\n\nwas - there's rape and forcible rape. He's argued that in the case\n\nof rape or incest, it was still - it would be a crime to engage in\n\nhaving an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.\n\nRYAN: All I'm saying is, if you believe that life begins at\n\nconception, that, therefore, doesn't change the definition of life.\n\nThat's a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to\n\noppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the\n\nmother.\n\nNow, I've got to take issue with the Catholic church and\n\nreligious liberty.\n\nBIDEN: You have on the issue...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... why would they keep - why would they keep suing you?\n\nIt's a distinction without a difference.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that\n\nabortion should remain legal be worried?\n\nRYAN: We don't think that unelected judges should make this\n\ndecision; that people through their elected representatives in\n\nreaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should\n\nmake this determination.\n\nBIDEN: The court - the next president will get one or two\n\nSupreme Court nominees. That's how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask\n\nyourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -\n\nfor Mr. Romney, who do you think he's likely to appoint? Do you think\n\nhe's likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the\n\ncourt far right that would outlaw (inaudible) - outlaw abortion? I\n\nsuspect that would happen.\n\nI guarantee you, that will not happen. We picked two people. We\n\npick people who are open-minded. They've been good justices. So keep\n\nan eye on the Supreme Court...\n\nRYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?\n\nBIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an\n\nopen mind; did not come with an agenda.\n\nRADDATZ: I'm - I'm going to move on to this closing question\n\nbecause we are running out of time.\n\nCertainly (inaudible) and you've said it here tonight, that the\n\ntwo of you respect our troops enormously. Your son has served and\n\nperhaps someday your children will serve as well.\n\nI recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this\n\npresidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, \"the\n\nads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other rather\n\nthan building up the country.\"\n\nWhat would you say to that American hero about this campaign?\n\nAnd at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son who did\n\nserve a year in Iraq, that we only have one truly sacred obligation as\n\na government. That's to equip those we send into harm's way and care\n\nfor those who come home. That's the only sacred obligation we have.\n\nEverything else falls behind that.\n\nI would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated\n\nsoldier you talked about, fought for his country, that that should be\n\nhonored. He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who\n\ndon't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having\n\nto pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility.\n\nI would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in\n\nthis campaign and occur in every campaign that I'm sure both of us\n\nregret anyone having said, particularly in these - these special new\n\ngroups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have\n\nto identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the\n\nother candidate. It's - it's an abomination.\n\nBut the bottom line here is I'd ask that hero you referenced to\n\ntake a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has\n\nthe conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where\n\nthey were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out. Or\n\nwhether or not he's going to continue to focus on taking care of only\n\nthe very wealthy, not asking them to make - pay any part of the deal\n\nto bring - bring back the middle class and the economy of this\n\ncountry.\n\nI'd ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United\n\nStates has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the\n\nslipshod comments being made by my - my - or by Governor Romney\n\nserve - serve our interests very well.\n\nBut there are things that have been said in campaigns that I - I\n\nfind not very appealing.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.\n\nSecond of all, I'd say we are not going to impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and\n\ntheir safety.\n\nAnd then I would say, you have a president who ran for president\n\nfour years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned his\n\ncampaign into attack, blame and defame.\n\nYou see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you\n\npaint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President\n\nObama said in 2008. It's what he's doing right now.\n\nLook at all the string of broken promises. If you like your\n\nhealth care plan, you can keep it. Try telling that to the 20 million\n\npeople who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare\n\ngoes through or the 7-point million - 7.4 million seniors who are\n\ngoing to lose it.\n\nOr remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than\n\n$250,000, your taxes won't go up. Of the 21 tax increases in\n\nObamacare, 12 of them hit the middle class.\n\nOr remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down\n\n$2,500 per family, per year? They've gone up $3,000, and they're\n\nexpected to go up another $2,400.\n\nOr remember when he said, \"I promise by the end of my first term\n\nI'll cut the deficit in half in four years\"? We've had four budgets,\n\nfour trillion-dollar deficits.\n\nA debt crisis is coming. We can't keep spending and borrowing\n\nlike this. We can't keep spending money we don't have.\n\nLeaders run to problem to fix problems. President Obama has not\n\neven put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal\n\nwith this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt\n\nRomney's put ideas on the table.\n\nWe've got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us. The\n\nbudget office, \"Can we see the plan?\" They sent us to the press\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Tell us what President Obama's plan is\n\nto prevent a debt crisis.\" They said, \"It's a speech, we can't\n\nestimate speeches.\"\n\nYou see, that's what we get in this administration - speeches -\n\nbut we're not getting leadership.\n\nMitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His\n\nlifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship.\n\nAnd what do we have from the president? He broke his big promise\n\nto bring people together to solve the country's biggest problems.\n\nAnd what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.\n\nBIDEN: Martha?\n\nRYAN: We can do better than this.\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'll get equal time.\n\nRADDATZ: You will get just a few minutes here. A few seconds,\n\nreally.\n\nBIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have\n\neviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It is\n\n(inaudible) he will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will\n\nkick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the\n\ntax credit people have to be able to send their children to college.\n\nIt cuts education by $450 billion.\n\nIt does - it does virtually nothing except continue to increase\n\nthe tax cuts for the very wealthy. And, you know, we've had enough of\n\nthis.\n\nThe idea that he's so concerned about these deficits, I've\n\npointed out he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did...\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to the closing statements\n\nin a minute.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You're going to have your closing statement.\n\nRYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way,\n\nour budget...\n\nBIDEN: We have not raised...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... by 3 percent a year instead of 4.5 percent like they\n\npropose. Not spending more money as much as they say is not a\n\nspending cut.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me - let me calm down things here just for a\n\nminute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to\n\nclosing statements about your own personal character. If you are\n\nelected, what could you both give to this country as a man, as a human\n\nbeing, that no one else could?\n\nRYAN: Honesty, no one else could? There are plenty of fine\n\npeople who could lead this country. But what you need are people who,\n\nwhen they say they're going to do something, they go do it. What you\n\nneed are, when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those\n\nproblems. We're not getting that.\n\nLook, we can grow this economy faster. That's what our five-\n\npoint plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It's about\n\ngetting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay, getting people out of\n\npoverty into the middle class. That means going with proven, pro-\n\ngrowth policies that we know works to get people back to work.\n\nPutting ideas on the table, working with Democrats - that actually\n\nworks sometimes - and then...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President, can we get to that - to that issue of\n\nwhat you could bring as a man, a human being? And I really - I'm\n\ngoing to keep you to about 15 seconds here.\n\nBIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, that's OK.\n\nRADDATZ: He didn't have 40. He didn't have 40.\n\nBIDEN: That's all right.\n\nLet me tell you. I - my - my record stands for itself. I\n\nnever say anything I don't mean. Everybody knows, whatever I say, I\n\ndo. And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field\n\nfor middle-class people, giving them an even break, treating Main\n\nStreet and Wall Street the same, hold them to the same responsibility.\n\nLook at my record. It's been all about the middle class.\n\nThey're the people who grow this country. We think you grow this\n\ncountry from the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we now turn to the candidates for their closing\n\nstatements. Thank you, gentlemen. And that coin toss, again, has\n\nVice President Biden starting with the closing statement.\n\nBIDEN: Well, let - let me say at the outset that I want to\n\nthank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is\n\nthat we're in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.\n\nPeople are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring relief to the\n\npeople who need the most help now.\n\nAnd - and in the process, we - in case you haven't noticed, we\n\nhave strong disagreements, but I - you probably detected my\n\nfrustration with their attitude about the American people. My friend\n\nsays that 30 percent of the American people are takers. Romney points\n\nout 47 percent of the people won't take responsibility.\n\nHe's talking about my mother and father. He's talking about the\n\nplaces I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont, and he's\n\ntalking about - he's talking about the people that have built this\n\ncountry. All they're looking for, Martha, all they're looking for is\n\nan even shot. Whenever you give them the shot, they've done it.\n\nThey've done it. Whenever you've leveled the playing field, they've\n\nbeen able to move. And they want a little bit of peace of mind.\n\nAnd the president and I are not going to rest until that playing\n\nfield is leveled, they, in fact, have a clear shot, and they have\n\npeace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree\n\nof confidence, \"Honey, it's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.\"\n\nThat's what this is all about.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I want to thank you, as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky,\n\nCentre College, and I want to thank you, Joe. It's been an honor to\n\nengage in this critical debate.\n\nWe face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to\n\nbe? What kind of country are we going to give our kids? President\n\nObama, he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda,\n\nmore spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of\n\nhealth care. It's not working. It's failed to create the jobs we\n\nneed.\n\nTwenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today.\n\nFifteen percent of Americans are in poverty. This is not what a real\n\nrecovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to\n\nearn your support. We're offering real reforms for a real recovery\n\nfor every American.\n\nMitt Romney - his experience, his ideas, his solutions - is\n\nuniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a\n\njobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job-creator in\n\nthe White House?\n\nThe choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more\n\ngovernment dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes\n\nopportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough\n\nissues, and we will not blame others for the next four years. We will\n\ntake responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding\n\nprinciples. We will reapply our founding principles.\n\nThe choice is clear, and the choice rests with you. And we ask\n\nyou for your vote. Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please\n\ntune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate at Hofstra\n\nUniversity in New York. I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope\n\nall of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.\n\n(APPLAUSE)", "comment_3": "See AARP response to white paper on \"Guaranteed Choices to Strengthen Medicare & Health Security Choices for All\" at http://t.co/Q1BtbBGI", "split": "train"}

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States. We are giving every member of Congress an opportunity to stand with the American people by affirming their opposition to bringing these terrorists into our communities, and we hope they join us. Equally as important, this bill holds the Administration accountable if it acts unilaterally against the will of the American people.\n\n\u201cThe world did not suddenly become safe in January 2009. There are still terrorists around the world who are committed to killing Americans and destroying our way of life. A number of those terrorists are being held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay right now. If the Administration is allowed to proceed, they won\u2019t be there for long. In fact, they may be right here, in the United States. I have been urging the Administration to finally present to the American people its plan for what to do with the terrorists held at Guantanamo and for confronting and defeating the global terrorist threat. Right now, that plan does not exist, and the safety of our nation depends on it.\n\n\u201cOur ranking members John McHugh, Pete Hoekstra, Lamar Smith, Peter King, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen all deserve great credit for their work on this measure. I thank them for their efforts in crafting this critically important bill.\u201d\n\nNOTE: Following is a summary of the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act:\n\nAffirming Congress\u2019 Opposition to the Release and Transfer of Terrorists. The bill affirms Congress\u2019 opposition to transferring or releasing terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. Most Americans do not support releasing these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay prison and transferring them into the United States. The bill gives Congress an opportunity to show that it stands with the American people on this critical matter, and opposes the release and transfer of these terrorists.\n\nGovernor & State Legislature Pre-Approval. The measure prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without express approval from the state\u2019s governor and legislature, and certifies to Congress that strict requirements have been met. For example, the Administration must certify to the respective governor and state legislature that the detainee does not pose a security risk to the United States. The certifications must be made 60 days before any transfer or release.\n\nPresidential Certification Requirements. The measure prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides the following notification and certification to Congress regarding:\n\n\n\n- The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States.\n\n\n\n- The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee.\n\n\n\n- The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee.\n\n\n\n- The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States.\n\n#####", "comment_3": "House GOP Introduces Keep Terrorists Out of America Act  http://bit.ly/30Sr5g #tcot #tlot", "split": "train"}

We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,\" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.\"\n\nHe said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.\n\nSchiff: Shiite militias \u201cnot the answer\u201d to combat ISIS in Iraq\n\nBut California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, Schiff said, \"We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.\n\n\"Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,\" he said.\n\nHe warned that sending in a lot of American troops could \"aggravate\" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after ISIS\u2019 big gains?\n\nMcCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.\n\n\"George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Schiff said there is an \"ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS.\" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.\n\n\"I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,\" he said.", "comment_3": "Full Video:  Mitt Romney on CBS Face the Nation, Interview with Bob Schieffer. 6-17-12 http://t.co/qCvBeZbB", "split": "train"}

Eisenhower Executive Office Building\n\n9:40 A.M. EDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Please be seated.\n\nBefore I begin today, let me acknowledge, first of all, Your Excellencies, all the ambassadors who are in attendance. I also want to acknowledge both the civilians and our military personnel that are about to be deployed to the region. And I am very grateful to all of you for your extraordinary work.\n\nI want to acknowledge General David Petraeus, who's here, and has been doing an outstanding job at CENTCOM, and we appreciate him. I want to thank Bruce Reidel -- Bruce is down at the end here -- who has worked extensively on our strategic review. I want to acknowledge Karl Eikenberry, who's here, and is our Ambassador-designate to Afghanistan. And to my national security team, thanks for their outstanding work.\n\nToday, I'm announcing a comprehensive, new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. And this marks the conclusion of a careful policy review, led by Bruce, that I ordered as soon as I took office. My administration has heard from our military commanders, as well as our diplomats. We've consulted with the Afghan and Pakistani governments, with our partners and our NATO allies, and with other donors and international organizations. We've also worked closely with members of Congress here at home. And now I\u2019d like to speak clearly and candidly to the American people.\n\nThe situation is increasingly perilous. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.\n\nMany people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: What is our purpose in Afghanistan? After so many years, they ask, why do our men and women still fight and die there? And they deserve a straightforward answer.\n\nSo let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.\n\nThe future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan. In the nearly eight years since 9/11, al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. This almost certainly includes al Qaeda's leadership: Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nBut this is not simply an American problem -- far from it. It is, instead, an international security challenge of the highest order. Terrorist attacks in London and Bali were tied to al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan, as were attacks in North Africa and the Middle East, in Islamabad and in Kabul. If there is a major attack on an Asian, European, or African city, it, too, is likely to have ties to al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan. The safety of people around the world is at stake.\n\nFor the Afghan people, a return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy, and the denial of basic human rights to the Afghan people -- especially women and girls. The return in force of al Qaeda terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence.\n\nAs President, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people. We are not in Afghanistan to control that country or to dictate its future. We are in Afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the United States, our friends and our allies, and the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent extremists.\n\nSo I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That's the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: We will defeat you.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we need a stronger, smarter and comprehensive strategy. To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq. To enhance the military, governance and economic capacity of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we have to marshal international support. And to defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, we must recognize the fundamental connection between the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan -- which is why I've appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who is here, to serve as Special Representative for both countries, and to work closely with General Petraeus to integrate our civilian and military efforts.\n\nLet me start by addressing the way forward in Pakistan.\n\nThe United States has great respect for the Pakistani people. They have a rich history and have struggled against long odds to sustain their democracy. The people of Pakistan want the same things that we want: an end to terror, access to basic services, the opportunity to live their dreams, and the security that can only come with the rule of law. The single greatest threat to that future comes from al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and that is why we must stand together.\n\nThe terrorists within Pakistan's borders are not simply enemies of America or Afghanistan -- they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of Pakistan. Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They've killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated Benazir Bhutto. They've blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment, and threatened the stability of the state. So make no mistake: al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.\n\nIt's important for the American people to understand that Pakistan needs our help in going after al Qaeda. This is no simple task. The tribal regions are vast, they are rugged, and they are often ungoverned. And that's why we must focus our military assistance on the tools, training and support that Pakistan needs to root out the terrorists. And after years of mixed results, we will not, and cannot, provide a blank check.\n\nPakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.\n\nThe government's ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security. To help Pakistan weather the economic crisis, we must continue to work with the IMF, the World Bank and other international partners. To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan. To avoid the mistakes of the past, we must make clear that our relationship with Pakistan is grounded in support for Pakistan's democratic institutions and the Pakistani people. And to demonstrate through deeds as well as words a commitment that is enduring, we must stand for lasting opportunity.\n\nA campaign against extremism will not succeed with bullets or bombs alone. Al Qaeda's offers the people of Pakistan nothing but destruction. We stand for something different. So today, I am calling upon Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by John Kerry and Richard Lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools and roads and hospitals, and strengthen Pakistan's democracy. I'm also calling on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Maria Cantwell, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence. And we will ask our friends and allies to do their part -- including at the donors conference in Tokyo next month.\n\nI don't ask for this support lightly. These are challenging times. Resources are stretched. But the American people must understand that this is a down payment on our own future -- because the security of America and Pakistan is shared. Pakistan's government must be a stronger partner in destroying these safe havens, and we must isolate al Qaeda from the Pakistani people. And these steps in Pakistan are also indispensable to our efforts in Afghanistan, which will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border.\n\nSecurity demands a new sense of shared responsibility. And that's why we will launch a standing, trilateral dialogue among the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our nations will meet regularly, with Secretaries Clinton and Secretary Gates leading our effort. Together, we must enhance intelligence sharing and military cooperation along the border, while addressing issues of common concern like trade, energy, and economic development.\n\nThis is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent Afghanistan from becoming the al Qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11. To succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the Taliban's gains, and promote a more capable and accountable Afghan government.\n\nOur troops have fought bravely against a ruthless enemy. Our civilians have made great sacrifices. Our allies have borne a heavy burden. Afghans have suffered and sacrificed for their future. But for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq. Now, we must make a commitment that can accomplish our goals.\n\nI've already ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops that had been requested by General McKiernan for many months. These soldiers and Marines will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border. This push will also help provide security in advance of the important presidential elections in Afghanistan in August.\n\nAt the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of Afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country. That's how we will prepare Afghans to take responsibility for their security, and how we will ultimately be able to bring our own troops home.\n\nFor three years, our commanders have been clear about the resources they need for training. And those resources have been denied because of the war in Iraq. Now, that will change. The additional troops that we deployed have already increased our training capacity. And later this spring we will deploy approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces. For the first time, this will truly resource our effort to train and support the Afghan army and police. Every American unit in Afghanistan will be partnered with an Afghan unit, and we will seek additional trainers from our NATO allies to ensure that every Afghan unit has a coalition partner. We will accelerate our efforts to build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward.\n\nThis push must be joined by a dramatic increase in our civilian effort. Afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people. The economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency. The people of Afghanistan seek the promise of a better future. Yet once again, we've seen the hope of a new day darkened by violence and uncertainty.\n\nSo to advance security, opportunity and justice -- not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces -- we need agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers. That's how we can help the Afghan government serve its people and develop an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs. And that's why I'm ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground. That's also why we must seek civilian support from our partners and allies, from the United Nations and international aid organizations -- an effort that Secretary Clinton will carry forward next week in The Hague.\n\nAt a time of economic crisis, it's tempting to believe that we can shortchange this civilian effort. But make no mistake: Our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we don't invest in their future. And that's why my budget includes indispensable investments in our State Department and foreign assistance programs. These investments relieve the burden on our troops. They contribute directly to security. They make the American people safer. And they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run -- because it's far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop -- or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to Afghan responsibility.\n\nAs we provide these resources, the days of unaccountable spending, no-bid contracts, and wasteful reconstruction must end. So my budget will increase funding for a strong Inspector General at both the State Department and USAID, and include robust funding for the special inspector generals for Afghan Reconstruction.\n\nAnd I want to be clear: We cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes Afghans to lose faith in their own leaders. Instead, we will seek a new compact with the Afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior, and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.\n\nIn a country with extreme poverty that's been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies. Now, I have no illusion that this will be easy. In Iraq, we had success in reaching out to former adversaries to isolate and target al Qaeda in Iraq. We must pursue a similar process in Afghanistan, while understanding that it is a very different country.\n\nThere is an uncompromising core of the Taliban. They must be met with force, and they must be defeated. But there are also those who've taken up arms because of coercion, or simply for a price. These Afghans must have the option to choose a different course. And that's why we will work with local leaders, the Afghan government, and international partners to have a reconciliation process in every province. As their ranks dwindle, an enemy that has nothing to offer the Afghan people but terror and repression must be further isolated. And we will continue to support the basic human rights of all Afghans -- including women and girls.\n\nGoing forward, we will not blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable. We\u2019ll consistently assess our efforts to train Afghan security forces and our progress in combating insurgents. We will measure the growth of Afghanistan\u2019s economy, and its illicit narcotics production. And we will review whether we are using the right tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our goals.\n\nNone of the steps that I've outlined will be easy; none should be taken by America alone. The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or al Qaeda operates unchecked. We have a shared responsibility to act -- not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it. And what\u2019s at stake at this time is not just our own security -- it's the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security. That was the founding cause of NATO six decades ago, and that must be our common purpose today.\n\nMy administration is committed to strengthening international organizations and collective action, and that will be my message next week in Europe. As America does more, we will ask others to join us in doing their part. From our partners and NATO allies, we will seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the Afghan elections, training Afghan security forces, a greater civilian commitment to the Afghan people. For the United Nations, we seek greater progress for its mandate to coordinate international action and assistance, and to strengthen Afghan institutions.\n\nAnd finally, together with the United Nations, we will forge a new Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region -- our NATO allies and other partners, but also the Central Asian states, the Gulf nations and Iran; Russia, India and China. None of these nations benefit from a base for al Qaeda terrorists, and a region that descends into chaos. All have a stake in the promise of lasting peace and security and development.\n\nThat is true, above all, for the coalition that has fought together in Afghanistan, side by side with Afghans. The sacrifices have been enormous. Nearly 700 Americans have lost their lives. Troops from over 20 countries have also paid the ultimate price. All Americans honor the service and cherish the friendship of those who have fought, and worked, and bled by our side. And all Americans are awed by the service of our own men and women in uniform, who've borne a burden as great as any other generation\u2019s. They and their families embody the example of selfless sacrifice.\n\nI remind everybody, the United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives. Al Qaeda and its allies have since killed thousands of people in many countries. Most of the blood on their hands is the blood of Muslims, who al Qaeda has killed and maimed in far greater number than any other people. That is the future that al Qaeda is offering to the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan -- a future without hope or opportunity; a future without justice or peace.\n\nSo understand, the road ahead will be long and there will be difficult days ahead. But we will seek lasting partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan that promise a new day for their people. And we will use all elements of our national power to defeat al Qaeda, and to defend America, our allies, and all who seek a better future. Because the United States of America stands for peace and security, justice and opportunity. That is who we are, and that is what history calls on us to do once more.\n\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEND\n\n10:02 A.M.

The debate was moderated by Lester Holt of NBC News and came as polls both nationally and in swing states are increasingly tight.\n\nThe complete transcript of the debate is posted below. The Fix team has annotated it with context, analysis and other thoughts, using Genius.\n\nTo see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted words. If you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\n\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\n\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\n\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\n\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Good luck to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\n\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\n\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\n\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\n\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nCLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\n\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\n\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\n\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\n\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\n\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\n\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\n\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n\nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\n\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\n\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\n\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\n\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\n\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\n\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\n\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\n\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\n\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\n\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\n\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\n\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\n\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\n\nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\n\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.\n\nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\n\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\n\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\n\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\n\nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: I think science is real.\n\nTRUMP: I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\n\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\n\nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\n\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\n\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\n\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\n\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually...\n\nTRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.\n\nCLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\n\nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...\n\nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\n\nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\n\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\n\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly...\n\nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...\n\nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\n\nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nCLINTON: And I have done a lot...\n\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\n\nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\n\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...\n\nTRUMP: Not.\n\nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...\n\nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: ... before you even announced.\n\nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: Look, there are differences...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: There are...\n\nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it.\n\nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\n\nTRUMP: But you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...\n\nTRUMP: That's about all you've...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Folks, we're going to...\n\nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.\n\nHOLT: We're going to move to...\n\nCLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\n\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\n\nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\n\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\n\nWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\n\nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\n\nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...\n\nCLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.\n\nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.\n\nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...\n\nTRUMP: Facts.\n\nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...\n\nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\n\nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\n\nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...\n\nTRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\n\nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...\n\nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...\n\nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\n\nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...\n\nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\n\nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity...\n\nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\n\nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.\n\nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\n\nCLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.\n\nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.\n\nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.\n\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.\n\nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\n\nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\n\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\n\nTRUMP: Why not?\n\nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\n\nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\n\nHOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\n\nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it.\n\nCLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...\n\nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...\n\nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...\n\nTRUMP: Lester, how much?\n\nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\n\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\n\nCLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...\n\nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\n\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\n\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\n\nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\n\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\n\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\n\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\n\nHOLT: The IRS says an audit...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nHOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\n\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.\n\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\n\nHOLT: So it's negotiable?\n\nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...\n\nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\n\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\n\nCLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\n\nTRUMP: That makes me smart.\n\nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\n\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\n\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\n\nHOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\n\nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\n\nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\n\nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\n\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.\n\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\n\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\n\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\n\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.\n\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\n\nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n\nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\n\nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the other thing I think is important...\n\nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.\n\nCLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\n\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\n\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\n\nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\n\nCLINTON: Well, to...\n\nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too.\n\nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\n\nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\n\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\n\nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...\n\nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.\n\nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.\n\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\n\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\n\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\n\nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\n\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\n\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\n\nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\n\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\n\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\n\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\n\nCLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\n\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\n\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\n\nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\n\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.\n\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\n\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\n\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\n\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\n\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\n\nWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\n\nHOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\n\nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\n\nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\n\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\n\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\n\nBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\n\nTRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\n\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton...\n\nTRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Ugh.\n\nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\n\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\n\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\n\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\n\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\n\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\n\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\n\nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\n\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\n\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\n\nCLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.\n\nHOLT: Please.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\n\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\n\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\n\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\n\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\n\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\n\nCLINTON: No, I'm not.\n\nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.\n\nCLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\n\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\n\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\n\nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.\n\nHOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\n\nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\n\nThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...\n\nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I...\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\n\nTRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\n\nTRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\n\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\n\nHOLT: That was...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\n\nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\n\nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\n\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\n\nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\n\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\n\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\n\nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\n\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\n\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\n\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.\n\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\n\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\n\nTRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.\n\nBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\n\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\n\nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\n\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\n\nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\n\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired.\n\nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.\n\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\n\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.\n\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\n\nTRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.\n\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\n\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\n\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.\n\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\n\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\n\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\n\nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\n\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\n\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\n\nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\n\nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\n\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\n\nCLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\n\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\n\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\n\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\n\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\n\nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\n\nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond.\n\nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\n\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\n\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\n\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\n\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\n\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\n\nAnd they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\n\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...\n\nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered...\n\nTRUMP: No, wait a minute.\n\nCLINTON: We've covered this ground.\n\nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...\n\nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.\n\nHOLT: In 2002...\n\nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n\nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it...\n\nTRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...\n\nHOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\n\nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...\n\nTRUMP: The record does not show that.\n\nHOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...\n\nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than...\n\nTRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\n\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.\n\nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...\n\nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Whew, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\n\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\n\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\n\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\n\nTRUMP: That would not start a war.\n\nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...\n\nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us.\n\nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.\n\nTRUMP: It's lies.\n\nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\n\nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...\n\nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.\n\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\n\nHOLT: We need to move on.\n\nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\n\nHOLT: Our last...\n\nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\n\nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\n\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\n\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\n\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\n\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\n\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\n\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired.\n\nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.\n\nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\n\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\n\nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\n\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\n\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.\n\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is...\n\nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.\n\nHOLT: ... is expired.\n\nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...\n\nHOLT: We have just...\n\nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.\n\nHOLT: We have just a few final questions...\n\nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n\nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\"\n\nTRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\n\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.\n\nHOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\n\nHOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.\n\nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...\n\nTRUMP: I never said that.\n\nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\n\nTRUMP: I didn't say that.\n\nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.\n\nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...\n\nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\n\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...\n\nHOLT: Please very quickly.\n\nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.\n\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.\n\nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\n\nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question.\n\nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\n\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\n\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\n\nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?\n\nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.

The Senator who sounded the alarm, Mark Udall, and the Committee Chairs who approved the program, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Congressman Mike Rogers. Plus our Powerhouse Roundtable on that, and all the weeks politics with ABC's George Will and Matthew Dowd, Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman from the New York Times, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Great Van Susteren from Fox News.\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.\n\nAnd our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?\n\nGREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.\n\nSo what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies. Your response to that?\n\nGREENWALD: Every single time any major media outlet reports on something that the government is hiding, that political officials don't want people to know, such as the fact that they are collecting the phone records of all Americans, regardless of any suspicion of wrongdoing? The people in power do exactly the same thing. They attack the media as the messenger and they try and discredit the story. This has been going back decades, ever since the Pentagon Papers were released by the New York Times, and political officials said, you are endangering national security.\n\nThe only thing we've endangered is the reputation of the people in power who are building this massive spying apparatus without any accountability who are trying to hide from the American people what it is that they are doing. There is no national security harm from letting people know that they are collecting all phone records, that they are tapping into the Internet, that they are planning massive cyber attacks both foreign and -- and even domestic. These are things that the American people have a right to know. The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and they way they exercise power in the dark.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: One of the things you reported is that the government has, quote, \"direct access\" to the servers of massive internet firms, like Google and Microsoft and Facebook, and all the companies have come out and denied it. You see Google saying, \"The U.S. government does not have direct access or a backdoor to the information stored in our data centers.\" Similar statements from Facebook and Apple. And Mr. Clapper also said, \"The U.S. government does not unilaterally obtain information.\" Now, I take it there could be some semantic word games being played here. What's your understanding about what is actually happening? Because it does appear that they don't have direct access to the servers.\n\nGREENWALD: Well, our story was very clear. What we said was that, and -- and we presented it as the story from the start, was that we have top secret NSA documents that claim that there is a new program called The PRISM Program, in place since 2007 that provides, in the words of the NSA's own documents, direct collection, directly from the servers of these companies. We then went to all of those companies named, and they said no, we don't provide direct access to our servers, so there was a conflict, which is what we reported, that the NSA claims that they have direct access, the companies deny it.\n\nClearly, there are all kinds of negotiations taking place and all kinds of agreements that have been reached between these internet companies that store massive amounts of communication data about people around the world, and the government. We should have this debate out in the open. Let these companies that collect massive amounts of information about people, and the government, resolve this discrepancy in public. Tell us what it is exactly that these companies are turning over to the government, and what kinds of capabilities the government is wanting to access? So we reported these discrepancies precisely because we want them -- those parties to resolve it in -- in public, in sunlight, and-- and let people decide whether or not that's the kind of country they want to live in when -- when the government can -- can get this massive amount of information.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The DNI spokesman also said that a crimes report has been filed by the National Security Agency. Have you been contacted by the FBI or any federal law enforcement official yet?\n\nGREENWALD: No. And -- and any time they would like to speak to me, I'll be more than happy to speak to them, and I will tell them that there is this thing called the Constitution, and the very First Amendment of which guarantees a free press. As an American citizen, I have every right, and even the obligation as a journalist to tell my fellow citizens and -- and our readers what it is that the government is doing, that they don't want people in the United States to know about. And I'm happy to talk to them at any time, and the attempt to intimidate journalists and sources with these constant threats of investigation aren't going to work.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You described your source as a reader of yours who trusted how you would handle the materials. The source has also been described as a career government official, who was concerned about these programs. A former prosecutor called the source a double-agent. I know you're not going to reveal the source, obviously, but what more can you tell us about the individual's motivations?\n\nGREENWALD: Well, first of all, I am not going to confirm that there is only one individual, there could be one or more than one. But, let me first make this point, because I think this is so critical, because every time there is a whistle-blower, somebody who exposes government wrongdoing, the tactic of the government is to try and demonize them as a traitor. They risk their careers, and their lives, and their liberty. Because what they were seeing being done in secret, inside the United States government is so alarming, and so pernicious that they simply want one thing.\n\nAnd that is for the American people, at least to learn about what this massive spying apparatus is, and what the capabilities are, so that we can have an open, honest debate about whether that's the kind of country that we want to live in. And if the people decide that they -- yes, they do want the government knowing everything about them, intervening in all of their communications, monitoring them, keeping dossiers on them, then so be it. But at least we should have that debate openly and democratically. Unfortunately, since the government hides virtually everything that they do at the threat of criminal prosecution, the only way for us to learn about them is through these courageous whistle-blowers who deserve our praise and gratitude and not imprisonment and prosecution.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, should we be expecting more revelations from you?\n\nGREENWALD: You should.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Glenn Greenwald, thanks very much.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now to the senator who says he did everything short of leaking classified information to shine a light on these surveillance programs. Here is Mark Udall on the Senate floor more than two years ago.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUDALL: The intelligence community can target individuals who have no connection to terrorist organizations. They can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Senator Udall joins us from Colorado this morning. Thank you for joining us, Senator. Is everything we're learning this week consistent with what you knew then?\n\nUDALL: It is, George, and as you pointed out, I tried to draw attention to what was happening over two years ago. I am not happy that we've had leaks and these leaks are concerning, but I think it's an opportunity now to have a discussion about the limits of surveillance, how we create transparency, and above all, how we protect Americans' privacy.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, what is your main concern here? Because the president has come out and said that that the programs are approved by Congress, overseen by the courts, and carefully constrained. Here he was on Friday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: They are very focused, and in the abstract, you can complain about big brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You don't believe the right balance has been struck?\n\nUDALL: I don't. My main concern is Americans don't know the extent to which they are being surveilled, George. We hear this term metadata, which has to do with when you make calls, where you make calls to, who you're talking to. I think that's private information, and I think if the government is gathering that, the American people ought to know it, we ought to have a discussion about it, and frankly, I think we ought to reopen the Patriot Act and put some limits on the amount of data that the National Security Administration is collecting.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What kind of limits exactly? Because as the president pointed out, no one is listening to phone calls here, and they are not allowed to continue the targeting of any individual unless they have probable cause, unless they have developed some information that would give them a reason to continue with tracking.\n\nUDALL: My concern is, look, you know through a contract with your company that they're going to collect this data, but the phone company can't arrest you, prosecute you, put you in jail. And metadata, although it sounds simple and it sounds innocuous, can lead to a lot of additional information. I just draw the line a little bit differently than the president does. We do need to remember, we're in a war against terrorists, and terrorism remains a real threat, but I also think we have to cue to the Bill of Rights, and the Fourth Amendment, which prevents unlawful searches and seizures, ought to be important to us. It ought to remain sacred, and there's got to be a balance here. That is what I'm aiming for. Let's have the debate, let's be transparent, let's open this up. I don't think the American public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator, the president has said that this has been fully debated and authorized by the Congress.\n\nUDALL: It has been, George, but in a limited way, if I might make that point, and that's why I want to reopen the Patriot Act, I think now that this information is more available. I certainly have a lot of Coloradans say to me they are uncomfortable with this, they want to know more. That's my point, is let's have a debate here, let's look at what is really happening. It's what I was trying to draw attention to two years ago. Millions of records every day being accumulated, makes me uneasy. I think it's a violation of our privacy. Let's take a further look at this.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think that the administration has been straight with the Congress in their testimonies?\n\nUDALL: You know, in general, I do. And look, this is the law, but the way the law is being interpreted has really concerned me. The law has been interpreted in a secret way. That's what I've been calling for, is let's have full disclosure of how this law is being applied. This isn't a scandal, but this is deeply concerning to me and a lot of Americans, and frankly a lot of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And do you believe, though, that the program has been effective? We had Chairman Mike Rogers coming up saying, who said that this program has helped stop terrorist attacks, and (inaudible) reported that the subway, the attempted subway plot in New York subways in 2009 could have been stopped by this program.\n\nUDALL: George, I am not convinced, and by the way, there are two programs that are being discussed. There is one the so-called PRISM program, Article 702 in the law, and it's been very effective. It surveils foreigners, grabs content, photographs, emails. The 215 provisions which are collecting all the metadata, I am not convinced that it's uniquely valuable intelligence that we could not have generated in other ways. So I know these claims are being made, but that's all the more reason to have a debate, to share this information and to determine whether or not we ought to be collecting millions of records every day of Americans' phone calls. It's just to me a violation of our privacy, particularly if it's done in ways that we don't know about.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Udall, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nUDALL: Hey, George, thanks for having me on.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get a response now from the chairs of the intelligence committees, Democrat Dianne Feinstein from the Senate and Republican Mike Rogers from the House. And Senator Feinstein, let me begin with you. You heard Mr. Greenwald and Senator Udall right there. They believe that the balance between privacy and national security is out of whack with these programs. Your response.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, of course, balance is a difficult thing to actually identify what it is, but I can tell you this: These programs are within the law. The business records section is reviewed by a federal judge every 90 days. It should be noted that the document that was released that was under seal, which reauthorized the program for another 90 days, came along with a second document that placed and discussed the strictures on the program. That document was not released.\n\nSo here's what happens with that program. The program is essentially walled off within the NSA. There are limited numbers of people who have access to it. The only thing taken, as has been correctly expressed, is not content of a conversation, but the information that is generally on your telephone bill, which has been held not to be private personal property by the Supreme Court.\n\nIf there is strong suspicion that a terrorist outside of the country is trying to reach someone on the inside of the country, those numbers then can be obtained. If you want to collect content on the American, then a court order is issued.\n\nSo, the program has been used. Two cases have been declassified. One of them is the case of David Headley, who went to Mumbai, to the Taj hotel, and scoped it out for the terrorist attack.\n\nThe second is Najibullah Zazi, who lived in Colorado, who made the decision that he was going to blow up a New York subway, who went to a beauty wholesale supply place, bought enough hydrogen peroxide to make bombs, was surveilled by the FBI for six months, traveled to go to New York, to meet with a number of other people who were going to carry out this attack with him, and were arrested by the FBI, who has pled guilty and in federal prison.\n\nHere is the point. And this is why this is so difficult. I flew over World Trade Center going to Senator Lautenberg's funeral, and in the distance was the Statue of Liberty. And I thought of those bodies jumping out of that building, hitting the canopy. Part of our obligation is keeping Americans safe. Human intelligence isn't going to do it, because you can't -- it's a different culture. It is a fanaticism that isn't going to come forward. And so, this kind of strict, strictly overseen -- it's overseen by the Justice Department, by inspectors general, by audits, by a 90-day review, by the court, is looked at as a method. I'm very happy if there's a better way, we will certainly look at it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring that to Congressman Rogers, because you also said you believe these programs are effective, Mr. Chairman.\n\nROGERS: I do.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But what about this idea, raised by Senator Udall, that you reopen the Patriot Act, and put more limits on particularly the phone record collection program? Because he says that that hasn't helped. That is his suspicion, at least.\n\nROGERS: Well, I can tell you, in the Zazi case in New York, it's exactly the program that was used. And remember, all of these programs, this is really important, George, I mean, really important. They are not -- the National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls and it is not reading Americans' emails. None of these programs allow that. As a matter of fact, the Patriot Act, part of that 702 says it's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic e-mail traffic in the United States. So the inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what Dianne and I know this program really does. And let's just talk about the phone records just real quickly. What this is, and the reason this happened is after 9/11, we realized there was a big hole in our ability to fully identify all of the players in that terrorist plot. And one of it was by the fact that these business records, the phone billing information, is destroyed by these companies. They can't, expense-wise, it's really difficult for them to hold them. So this is what happened. The court said, put all of that information in a box and hold that information, and when you want to access that information, you have to use this very specific court-ordered approval process, which means it has to be a foreign person believed to be on a foreign land. So some notion that they can see a name that even comes out of that -- by the way, this is important -- no name comes out of that search. So even if they get a number, it doesn't have a name on it. This then allows them to do further investigation.\n\nBut the number of times it's accessed is very -- it is a fraction of a fraction, number one. And number two, no one can data mine that information. That is what's so frustrating to those of us who know this program.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But that's what I was just going to get to. Both of you know so much more than any other Americans. One of the things you heard from Senator Udall is the desire for more public information. Now, he believes that the administration hasn't been misleading generally the committee and the public, but I want to play an exchange, it was in the Intelligence Committee in March, when James Clapper was questioned by your colleague, Senator Wyden.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. RON WYDEN, D-OREGON: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER, DNI: No, sir.\n\nWYDEN: It does not?\n\nCLAPPER: Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Feinstein, I have to confess, I have a hard time squaring that answer with what we learned this week.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I think this is very hard. There is no more direct or honest person than Jim Clapper, and I think both Mike and I know that. You can misunderstand the question. This is one of the dilemmas of talking about it. He could have thought the question had content or something, but it is true that this is a wide collection of phone records, as Mike said. No name, no content. But the number to number, the length of time, the kind of thing that's on the telephone bill, and we have to deal with that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, what do we do going forward? Senator McCain has said, and we heard Senator Udall as well, that maybe there should be a public hearing on this program and the range of the programs that are surveilling, that includes some surveillance of some data from Americans. Are you open to that, Senator Feinstein? And Chairman Rogers, you comment as well.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yeah, I am open to it. And I have to think about this. We had an intelligence committee meeting on Thursday, which I opened up to everybody and 27 senators came. You know, we informed them that every senator, the material is available. They can come and see it.\n\nOne of the structures of highly classified with no stuff is no staff. I think that should be changed so that intelligence committee staff can come in with the member and go over and review the material.\n\nBut we have had lots of hearings on this. And I think Senator Wyden knows this and has been respectful of it.\n\nAnd I'm open to doing a hearing every month if that's necessary. And I'm open to doing to doing an opening hearing now.\n\nHere's the rub, the instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks is all classified, that's what's so hard about this. So that we can't actually go in there and other than the two that have been released give the public an actual idea of people that have been saved, attacks that have been prevented, that kind of thing.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chairman Rogers?\n\nROGERS: You know, George, one of the things that we're charged with is keeping America safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact. I think we have done both in this particular case. And the problem with this is, if you tell our adversaries and enemies in the counterterrorism fight exactly how we conduct business, they are not going to business the same ever again. It makes it more difficult.\n\nAnd so each one of these programs -- and I think the Zazi case is so important, because that's one you can specifically show that this was the key piece that allowed us to stop a bombing in the New York Subway system.\n\nBut these programs, that authorized by the court by the way, only focused on non-United States persons overseas, that gets lost in this debate, are pieces of the puzzle. And you have to have all of the pieces of the puzzle to try to put it together. That's what we found went wrong in 9/11.\n\nAnd we didn't have all of the pieces of the puzzle, we found out subsequently, to the Boston bombings, either. And so had we had more pieces of the puzzle you can stop these things before they happen.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, we're just about -- sorry, we're just about out of time. I just want a quick answer from each of you on this. We saw that a crimes investigation has been opened. Is it fair to say that both of you believe that this investigation should be pursued and the source, if found, should be prosecuted?\n\nROGERS: I absolutely believe that someone did not have authorization to release this information. And why that's so important, George, is because they didn't have all of the information. I know your reported that you interviewed, Greenwald, says that he's got it all and now is an expert on the program. He doesn't have a clue how this thing works. Nether did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous.\n\nI argue that there's other methods. He could come to the committees, if they had concern. We have IGs that they can go to in a classified way if they have concern. Taking a very sensitive classified program that targets foreign person on foreign lands, and putting just enough out there to be dangerous, is dangerous to us, it's dangerous to our national security and it violates the oath of which that person took. I absolutely think they should be prosecuted.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You too, Senator Feinstein?\n\nFEINSTEIN: I do.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you both for your time this morning.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, our powerhouse round table weighs in on all this. Plus, the president's new foreign police fix. Chris Christie's controversial call. And Paul Krugman analyzes the latest jobs numbers.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: An update now on the race to fill John Kerry's Senate race up in Massachusetts. With the vote coming up later this month, the sparks flew at the first debate between veteran Democratic congressman Ed Markey and former Navy SEAL Gabriel Gomez.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nED MARKEY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS SENATE CANDIDATE: They want Mr. Gomez down there to help them get the majority that will ultimately further this grid lock that they have fostered over this lost generation.\n\nGABRIEL GOMEZ, (R) MASSACHUSETTS SENATE CANDIDATE: If you wanted to run against, you know, Newt Gingrich or George W. Bush or even Gerald Ford, who was president when you were down there for the first time, you should have run against them.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Both candidates will be here next week.

Michael Moore did -- what he says liberals must do now.\n\n\n\nPlus, the best political minds will be here with insights on this historic election.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in transition.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is now president-elect Trump. And the world is watching with bated breath to see just what he has in store for America. Protests against his election, of course, continue this weekend across the country, most of them peaceful, although the mayor of Portland, Oregon, is asking protesters to stand down in the wake of violence against police in that city.\n\n\n\nThere are some reports of violence against Trump supporters. In Connecticut, two men were arrested for allegedly beating a man holding a Trump sign. Meanwhile, civil rights groups in school districts across the country report an uptick in incidents of intimidation and harassment of minority groups and girls and women.\n\n\n\nGraffiti in North Carolina reads: \"Black lives doesn't matter and neither does your votes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Go back to Africa. Make America great again\" was written in a high school bathroom in Minnesota.\n\n\n\nTensions are high and tempers are flaring across the country. The country, of course, may be divided, but the government in Washington, D.C., is not. Republicans now control the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and, soon, the White House.\n\n\n\nSo what is on the Trump agenda and how quickly can it get done?\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Joining me now from Janesville, Wisconsin, is House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\n\n\nMr. Speaker, thanks so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nBefore we begin talking about legislation and moving forward, I'm just wondering, there are millions of Americans out there, as I'm sure you know, who are frankly terrified about what this America under President Trump will mean for them.\n\n\n\nIs there anything that you, as speaker of the House, one of the leaders of the nation, want to say to them?\n\n\n\nREP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Sure.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And, second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured. America is a pluralistic, inclusive country. It has, it has been, and it will continue to be.\n\n\n\nSo, I really think that people should put their minds at ease. We're going to get to work on solving the big country's problems, getting this economy growing, fixing our national security, you know, fixing our health care problems, getting our budget put together, the things that we have been talking about.\n\n\n\nSo, I think people should just really put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic. We're inclusive. That's the kind of country we want. That's the country we are. And that's the country we're still going to have.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: But just to accept and acknowledge that there are these incidents taking place all over the country...\n\n\n\nRYAN: Well, first, yes, I heard your lead-in there. That's terrible. That's awful.\n\n\n\nBy the way, that's not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they're not Republicans. And we don't want them in our party, even if they're thinking about it. And I'm confident Donald Trump feels the same way.\n\n\n\nSo, there's no place for that. And protests, as long as protests are peaceful, if people want to express themselves that way, that's what we can do in this country. That's what the First Amendment is all about.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Let's move forward to some of the action items.\n\n\n\nObviously, repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the big items that president-elect Trump and you want to tackle. President-elect Trump recently said there are elements of Obamacare he wants to keep. This is what he to say to \"60 Minutes.\" Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Let me does you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?\n\n\n\n[09:05:01]\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the -- strongest asset.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Now, your Better Way agenda talks about spending $25 billion on high-risk pools that would help those with preexisting conditions afford insurance. Where would that $25 billion come from?\n\n\n\nRYAN: Well, we actually have it paid for in our bill. You really want me to give you a technical answer to this? It gets a little technical.\n\n\n\nThe point is, we have in our plan pay for doing that. Here's the bigger point, Jake. We agree. It's in our plan. Donald Trump agrees with this. We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions.\n\n\n\nIn our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan. So, there are aspects that we have all along agreed to.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Under Obamacare, as you know, millions of people were able to get health insurance for the first time through the expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\n\nWhat is going happen to those people? Will they lose coverage under your plan?\n\n\n\nRYAN: Well, if you go -- what I encourage people to do is go to Better.GOP. It's number five on our plan. We put the most detail out of anybody that has put out an Obamacare replacement plan.\n\n\n\nAnd it is to have an answer for everyone with preexisting conditions, people who are the uninsured. The point I would say is this, Jake. We can have a health care system in America where everyone, regardless of income or health condition, can get affordable health insurance, get affordable health care.\n\n\n\nThis is what we propose. We think a patient-centered system is the right way to do that. And you can have the system without a costly government takeover, like Obamacare, that is cranking up premiums, that is making deductibles so high. Doesn't even feel like you have health insurance. Obamacare is failing. It must replaced.\n\n\n\nWe're going to do that. We're excited about it. And the point I would put people's minds at ease is, we can fix these problems. We can fix what was broken in health care without breaking what was working in health care. And that's exactly what we're proposing.\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to get any level of detail on this, just go to Better.GOP and see what we have already offered.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, as you know, the Medicaid expansion is providing government-paid health insurance to individuals. I mean, that's what it does. So, if you repeal Obamacare, does it repeal also the Medicaid expansion, or would that part of it stay?\n\n\n\nRYAN: For example, we propose to replace that with refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance.\n\n\n\nSo, the kinds of reforms that we're talking about will lower the cost of insurance itself. And then a person would have, such as our proposal calls for, a refundable tax credit, like a voucher, to go buy health insurance.\n\n\n\nThat's much cheaper, much more affordable. And, more importantly, you get to buy what you want to buy, not what the government is making you buy.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Obamacare also provides birth control to women at no cost. Is that going to end or will that remain?\n\n\n\nRYAN: Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: With all do respect, I don't know that the average woman of child-bearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don't know that she would think that that's just a nitty-gritty detail. That's...\n\n\n\nRYAN: You're asking me detail...\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, what do you think? Is it important to you?\n\n\n\nRYAN: Jake, you're asking me details about legislation -- you're asking me details about legislation that hasn't been written yet.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Right. But is it important to you? Would that be a principle? Would that be a principle of whatever replaces it, because...\n\n\n\nRYAN: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Let me ask you a question about improving security at the border. You and Donald Trump both agree you want to improve security at the border. You obviously have different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.\n\n\n\nThis is what you said to say back in April during a town hall at Georgetown University:\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRYAN: I'm a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Now take a listen to what president-elect Trump said on \"Morning Joe\" last year.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"MORNING JOE\")\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We're going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanely\n\n\n\nQUESTION: How are you going to pay for this?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: It's very inexpensive.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Are they going to be ripped out of their homes? How?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Can I tell you, they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So, Congress writes the laws and controls the purse strings\n\n\n\nIs there going to be mass deportation or not? And this isn't just a nitty-gritty detail. There are millions of people who are very worried about this.\n\n\n\nRYAN: Sure. Sure.\n\n\n\nAnd I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.\n\n\n\nWe think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border. So, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority. And that's what we're focused on.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: OK, so it's not a top priority, mass deportation. But, obviously, president-elect Trump thinks it is.\n\n\n\nRYAN: No, securing the border is our...\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\n\n\nRYAN: Securing the border is our top priority.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?\n\n\n\nRYAN: That's why I'm saying we're not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.\n\n\n\n[09:10:03]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, let me ask you, and does the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?\n\n\n\nRYAN: I'd say two things.\n\n\n\nLook at the expectations going into this. Look at what all the public polling said. Look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election. He beat all the odds.\n\n\n\nLook, what I think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating Donald Trump. A lot of us did that. I think he's very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also there's a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.\n\n\n\nSo, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track. We're now going to implement the solutions. And we think this is good. We think this is going to help people get out of poverty. We think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against ISIS, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.\n\n\n\nThese are good things that we have in store that we're really excited about getting to work on doing for the American people.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: One of the things that you don't mention -- and I can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect Trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and Donald Trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.\n\n\n\nIn his contract with the American voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers. Will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?\n\n\n\nRYAN: Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue.\n\n\n\nAnd if you go to number six on our Better Way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that Donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.\n\n\n\nSo, we think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect Trump talked about tariffs. It could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.\n\n\n\nRYAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: If he comes to you and says, this is what we're doing, what are you going say?\n\n\n\nRYAN: The point I'm trying to make is, I think we can achieve what he's trying -- he's trying to make America more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive. He's trying to make it so that American businesses stay in America.\n\n\n\nAnd we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: A minute ago, you were talking about how Donald Trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country. On that note, I want to turn to staffing at the Trump White House. A\n\n\n\nlot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that Steve Bannon, who is the CEO of the Trump campaign and the chief executive of Breitbart News, that he used Breitbart News to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of Republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-Semitic views, racist views.\n\n\n\nDo you have any concerns about Steve Bannon being in the White House?\n\n\n\nRYAN: No, I don't have concerns. I have never met the guy. I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns.\n\n\n\nI believe -- I trust Donald's judgment. I think he's going to pick who he thinks will best serve him. And I'm sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.\n\n\n\nSo, I believe that Donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing. I'm also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown he's a true leader, Mike Pence, is going to be running the transition team.\n\n\n\nSo, I think between Pence running the transition team -- look, Donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses. So, he's done things like this before. He's staffed up. He's run major organizations. He's a successful person. He surrounds himself with successful people.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm confident he's going to do the same here.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about Judge Curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.\n\n\n\nRYAN: Look, I'm not going to relitigate the past. I'm looking for the future.\n\n\n\nAnd I want I mean when I say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so we're safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the Constitution.\n\n\n\nI mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that. That's transformational. That's positive. That's good.\n\n\n\n[09:15:01]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The pride of Janesville, House Speaker Paul Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nRYAN: All right, thank you Jake. Take care.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER: The Trump transition team has been huddled inside Trump Tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, Cabinet nominees, White House staff.\n\n\n\nKellyanne Conway telling reports yesterday that Trump's choice for chief of staff is imminent. That and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect Trump plans to govern.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about the new Trump administration with top adviser Rudy Giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.\n\n\n\nMr. Mayor, thanks for joining us. And congratulations.\n\n\n\nRUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Thank you, Jake.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So, I know you're not going to answer...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Jake.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I know you're not going to answer any questions I have about what jobs you're being considered for.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So, let me just set that aside.\n\n\n\nThere's a big issue...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Thank you.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: There's a big issue at play here as you prepare for the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nI know you're more than cognizant of the fact that Donald Trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world. During the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts. I have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there.\n\n\n\nRun the company, kids. Have a good time. I'm going to do it for America, OK?\n\n\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: So, I would be willing to...\n\n\n\nQUESTION: So, you will put your assets in a blind trust?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust.\n\n\n\nWell, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust? I don't know.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I will answer that question. That's not a blind trust. If your kids run your businesses, it's not a blind trust.\n\n\n\nIn a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.\n\n\n\nDo you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether he's making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for Mr. Trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.\n\n\n\nI think he's in a very unusual situation. He would basically put his children out of work if -- and they'd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.\n\n\n\nSo, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.\n\n\n\nIt's kind of unrealistic to say, you're going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person. And, remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.\n\n\n\nSo, you would be putting them out of work. So, I think you're going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something that's fair, something that assures the American people, as he said, he has no interest in what's going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And stay out of all government matters.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, but, Mr. Mayor, I mean, his children are -- as I don't need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee. They are advising the transition, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric.\n\n\n\nJared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the White House, even if he's not paid for it.\n\n\n\nIf he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the American people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isn't at least partly making it to enrich himself?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the Trump Corporation, you can't -- I mean, there's no perfect way to do this.\n\n\n\nYou have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president. The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear of suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.\n\n\n\nSo, I think there can be a way to do this. And, by the way, Jared Kushner has his own company, completely independent of Trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company. He's maybe, you know, one of the biggest in New York. He -- so, Jared is a kind of different, different situation.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, I will just say this. And then you can dismiss it as you want. But I'm putting a flag in it right now.\n\n\n\nIf a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be Donald Trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether it's the pipeline in North Dakota, or business relationships in Turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his family's wealth?\n\n\n\n[09:20:07]\n\n\n\nI get that you think that that's not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: No, no, no.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm telling you is, the blind trust solution isn't much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it. And any decision that he made, even if he didn't know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.\n\n\n\nSo, blind trusts aren't perfect either. This is a very special kind of situation.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I think it's far better than -- it's far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business. I think...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: But they're not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.\n\n\n\nThere will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something I'm very familiar with from my days in the Justice Department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\n\n\nWell, if you thought the issues between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department were big, fasten your seat belts. But let's move on.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump shook up the Republican primary by...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Oh, I think, I think, Jake, Jake, Jake, I think that's a very unfair suggestion.\n\n\n\nThere, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash. I'm counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the IRS. And I don't -- I don't see that happening in a Trump administration.\n\n\n\nThis man didn't run for president because he wants to get rich. He's rich already.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: So, I don't think you're going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump shook up the Republican primary back in December when he made this promise. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling all and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.\n\n\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So, just a simple question. Is that policy still operative?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign. He did say that. That is correct.\n\n\n\nActually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included Congressman McCaul, General Flynn -- I can't remember who else, a few other people. We wrote a paper for him. And he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.\n\n\n\nIt would involve extreme vetting. The one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be Syrian refugees. All the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical Islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban. So, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the time\n\n\n\nthat he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Yes, he said that was an expansion.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: So, you can go back.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: He said it was an expansion of his original proposal.\n\n\n\nBut let's talk about what you're talking about, specifically, Mr. Trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.\n\n\n\nBack in June, when Senator Jeff Sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect Trump, when Senator Sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.\n\n\n\nSo, now that Mr. Trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, I would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.\n\n\n\nNow, let's take Egypt, for example. Egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting. The Sisi government is a strong ally. It has a pretty good hold on the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood. They have a very, very mature and really strong army. You could do vetting in Egypt.\n\n\n\nYemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting. So, I think this is going to be a country-by-country decision. Pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting. So, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country we're talking about? How many records can we get?\n\n\n\nThe reason the Syrian problem was so bad, the Syrian refugees, it's not just that you can't vet them, which actually Director Comey and I think about five members of the Obama administration have made clear, that you can't vet these people, these refugees from Syria.\n\n\n\n[09:25:12]\n\n\n\nThe problem also is that Baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population. He's told us he's going to do this.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: So, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States.\n\n\n\nWe're sort of being warned that he's bringing more people into attack us. We already have 1,000 investigations of radical Islamic terrorists in the United States. We can't add another whole group to that.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I want to ask you. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the Russian government maintained contacts with members of Trump's -- quote -- \"immediate entourage\" during the presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nWhat can you tell us about those contacts?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I know of no such contacts with the Russian government.\n\n\n\nI was pretty deeply involved in the campaign. I was with Donald Trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period. So, if that's going on, it's going on somewhere where I didn't see it.\n\n\n\nIt is true that I think Donald Trump wants to engage Russia in areas where we can work together in a way that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama failed to do. But, remember, he's going to do it from a different point of view.\n\n\n\nYou're forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester. We're going to go up to 550,000 troops, where we're going down to 420,000.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 ships.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Putin...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 troops (sic). Let me finish.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Yes.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: We're going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft. And we're going to increase the size of the Marines from about 27 battalions to 36.\n\n\n\nSo, he's going to be facing, Putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- he's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: A spokesman for Putin said that one of the first things that Trump can do as president is to convince NATO to pull back troops from near the Russian border.\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: No. No decision like that has been made, thought about.\n\n\n\nIn fact, during the campaign, Donald Trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in NATO as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the NATO countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent. TAPPER: OK.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And I think you're going see something more like that.\n\n\n\nI think a President Trump would want to increase the impact of NATO, but make sure that these countries are participating. You know, when we were fighting in Iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies weren't fighting. They were watching us, the U.K., and Canada fight, and they were just observing.\n\n\n\nWell, it can't work that way.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: They have got to be full participants. And we have to be full participants.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much. And congratulations again.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Thank you.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Donald Trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the White House. He instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will President Trump' Twitter feed look like?\n\n\n\nWe now have his answer.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all. I'm going to be very restrained.\n\n\n\nI find it tremendous. It is a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at.\n\n\n\nI do believe this. I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: President Obama is going to have to hand over the @POTUS Twitter handle to president-elect Trump.\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect from @POTUS when he enters the Oval Office?\n\n\n\nJoining me now is our panel, Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer, CNN politics reporter Sara Murray, CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson, and House Democratic Caucus Leader Congressman Xavier Becerra of California.\n\n\n\nSean, let me start with you.\n\n\n\nIn the final stretch of the campaign, it was reported that some of president-elect Trump's top aides had to wrest his phone away from him, so as to not have one of these sudden outbursts in the middle of the night or whatever.\n\n\n\n[09:30:10]\n\n\n\nWhat do you see going forward for the POTUS account?\n\n\n\nSEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think there's always a transition from campaigning to governing. You've seen it both with his speech Wednesday morning when he accepted that victory that he won for the American people. And then his comments when he was in Washington, D.C. with the president and others.\n\n\n\nHe understands that. He understands the role of the president in the words that he uses and the tweets that he sends will impact the country in a much different way than they do during a campaign.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Good enough for you, congressman?\n\n\n\nREP. XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA: No, because we've heard all sorts of words from Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAs a candidate you can say all you want, as a president, one word you say can affect not just markets, but the American people. So interest rates have already spiked. They are not sure what's going to happen in the markets since -- so today we try to buy a house as an American, it costs you more for the mortgage than it did two weeks ago. And so it will make a difference what he says. More importantly what he does.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Sara, you covered Trump for the last year and a half. He has since winning, there has been one kind of stray tweet in which he got mad at protesters and then I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but then he corrected it and celebrated their right to protest.\n\n\n\nHow do you see this holding, this quote/unquote \"Presidential Trump\"?\n\n\n\nSARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, he's already tweeting this morning attacks at \"The New York Times.\"\n\n\n\nSo I think the notion that all the sudden Donald Trump has woken up and realized that his weight carry or his words carry a lot more weight doesn't always stand. I think there are aides around him who remind him that you need to recalibrate your tone. I think that's what we saw from the two different tweets about protesters. One going after them and then one saying I love to see passionate people expressing their belief. That to me was a good indication that someone talked to him and said words matter more now, but the fact is, he still does have control of his Twitter. And there doesn't seem to be anyone who's sitting with him this morning. So I still think it is an open question of how he behaves and if he does realize that there are millions and millions of people following him there. And there already even more once he takes over the POTUS Twitter handle.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: This is a silly question on its face but I actually mean it very seriously. Do you think that -- I mean, obviously there were tweets sent out under his name by him and there are ones sent out by his campaign, you can actually tell ones were which by which device it was sent by.\n\n\n\nNIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Do you think it is up to Kellyanne Conway or whomever in his inner circle to change his password so he no longer has access to his Twitter feed?\n\n\n\nHENDERSON: You would hope something like that happens. I don't even know the way in which he tweets if he's just firing them off, dictating them to somebody else who fires them off but this is going to be a problem.\n\n\n\nPrimarily because Donald Trump has made the best argument for why he should keep tweeting in the same way, and that is, oh, he won. And it didn't harm him throughout the primaries. It didn't harm him in the general election. He actually believes it's helped him.\n\n\n\nAnd I also think, if you look at the people who support Donald Trump, they like that bombast. They like that rhetoric. That -- they like the fact that he isn't some sort of P.C. blow-dried politician. So in that way, I think it's going to be hard to rest some of the -- not only the Twitter account from him, but the way he engages with the public, the way he engages with the media, the way he engages with his own party and the folk that he is doesn't like, whether it's Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz's wife or whoever. I think this is going to be an issue and I'm not so sure that it's going to be -- we see another Donald Trump once he assumes the office.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Sara, we were talking before the show about how the Trump people are constantly trying to act as though he didn't propose banning all Muslims from entering the United States until a total complete shutdown until we figure out just what the hell is going on.\n\n\n\nYou heard Mayor Giuliani say that he basically walked that back although as you know he expanded it -- he described it as an expansion. Take a listen to what Mr. Trump -- president-elect Trump had to say about the issue just a few days ago.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: So where is this policy?\n\n\n\nMURRAY: That's a great question. I think this is going to be a question for a lot of Donald Trump's policies. Because we put a lot out there on the campaign trail. That he didn't necessarily flush out entirely and that he sort of walked back at points and then doubled down at points. That's what we saw with the Muslim ban.\n\n\n\nThe last thing we heard from Donald Trump was that when he talked about extreme vetting which at times included a religious test that to him was an expansion of the Muslim ban. But I think we saw the same thing when you talked to Paul Ryan about the notion of a deportation force and Donald Trump on a deportation force. Maybe they're not calling it a deportation force anymore. Maybe that's not what Donald Trump's calling it. Maybe that's not what House Speaker Paul Ryan is calling it.\n\n\n\nBut he has called for 5,000 additional border control agents. He has called for tripling the number of ICE officers. So there is certainly some sort of bolstering of these forces that would allow for increased deportation which is something Donald Trump promised.\n\n\n\n[09:35:01]\n\n\n\nBut I think everyone is kind of waiting to see how these things Donald Trump talks about on the campaign trail will turn into actual policy when he's in the White House and when he's dealing with Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: There does seem to be, Sean, a certain degree of people who are within the Trump orbit acting as though he didn't make certain proposals during the campaign that are on videotape or on the Donald J. Trump website. I mean, why is it an unreasonable question to ask if the Muslim ban is actually going to happen or a deportation --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSPICER: It's not unreasonable question.\n\n\n\nBut I think that there's going to be a time between now and January 20th where he will assemble a team and his priorities of how he's going to get things done. He's got to work with Congress. And I think those conversations that started the other day have to continue in terms of this isn't a dictatorship. This is democracy. We have to work with the House and the Senate. He will continue his discussions with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to layout the priorities of the sequencing but then also the exact -- the details of those policies.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Congressman Becerra, we talked -- I talked to you on the beginning of the show with Speaker Ryan about the fears that many Americans feel.\n\n\n\nYou represent a district with a large Latino population in California. What are people feeling in your district?\n\n\n\nBECERRA: I've heard everything from kids afraid to go to school because they're not sure their parents will be home when they get there. I've heard some families talk about not going to work. I've heard some people afraid to walk the streets because they may look like they're Muslim. I've heard everything and there is a great deal of apprehension.\n\n\n\nBe a great time right now. This is a prime time now for Donald Trump. It would be great time for him to get out there and say some words that would calm people to make sure that everyone feels comfortable going out. Whether it's to demonstrate civilly or whether it's just to go to school, but this is prime time now. And Donald Trump's words will make a big difference because so much of his talk during the campaign was so harsh and for many people, frightening.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: And Nia-Malika, take a look at this. This is from York, Pennsylvania, where students were caught on camera holding a Trump sign while another student shouted, white power.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: White power. White power. White power.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So that's a -- I don't know if that's a vine. It's a loop of some sort. But in any case, there's an investigation going on there, minority students have said they experienced more harassment since this election started.\n\n\n\nNow as I mentioned at the top of the show, there has also been violence against Trump supporters. But in the schools of America anecdotally it seems to be a lot of this. Do you think that president-elect Trump and in addition, perhaps even President Obama and Hillary Clinton have an obligation to come out and try to calm things?\n\n\n\nHENDERSON: I think they do.\n\n\n\nYou heard some of that from Donald Trump in his Wednesday morning address when he talked about binding America's wounds. And you've heard that from also Paul Ryan talking about the Republican Party being the party of Lincoln and being and inclusive party.\n\n\n\nI do think it's incumbent on Donald Trump to shift his rhetoric, to continue the rhetoric about unity. I do think he probably has a steeper heel to climb. Because I think just plainly, there are a lot of Americans who think that Donald Trump is a bigot and they don't think he's a bigot because they have any sort of prejudged notions about a Republican president, they think that because of some of the things he said during the campaign.\n\n\n\nSo the question is, can he give a sort of Bob Dole speech, the kind of speech he gave in the 1996 convention where he said, we're not a party of racists, talking about Republicans. Can he give that speech? And will people believe him? I think that's the question.\n\n\n\nYou know, I've heard from friends too. I've got a friend who's a middle school teacher. He said the Latino students were lined up at his door on Wednesday morning. Some of them weren't even his students. And they were incredibly afraid about what this president, he would look like, and what it would mean for them and their families.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Big challenge for president-elect Trump going forward. Thank you so much one and all.\n\n\n\nComing up protests against Donald Trump's election continue across the country this weekend. On the frontlines at Trump Tower, Michael Moore who predicted a Trump win. He'll be here live, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:43:16]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.\n\n\n\nIn the days since her defeat by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has been pretty busy. She was spotted walking her dog in the woods of Chappaqua. She handed out thousands of red roses to her campaign staff to thank them. And she at least partially pinned the blame for her loss on the FBI director.\n\n\n\nClinton telling donors on a conference call yesterday that the first letter released by Director Comey stopped the momentum she had built after the debates and the release of Trump's Access Hollywood tape. And that it was too much for her to overcome.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about that and much more with filmmaker Michael Moore who tried to warn his fellow Democrats of a Trump win on this show, on his blog and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThanks so much for joining us, Michael\n\n\n\nMICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Thanks for having me, Jake.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So what do you make of Hillary Clinton telling donors on Saturday that FBI Director Comey is at least largely to blame for her loss? Do you agree? Is she is in denial, what's your take?\n\n\n\nMOORE: I think it's part of it, absolutely. And I would -- I've actually called upon President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor, as soon as possible, to investigate how it is that the FBI director was able to interfere with an election, which I believe is not legal and help to tip the balance in what was going to be a very close election. I think that not only should people speak about it, it needs to be investigated.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: But, let's talk about one of the other weaknesses clearly of her campaign which you were talking about months ago which is the fact that there wasn't really any sort of direct economic outreach or plan to working class white voters in places like Michigan where you're from.\n\n\n\nEd Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania telling the \"New York Times\" that the Clinton campaign failed to spread its best resources outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n[09:45:04]\n\n\n\nHe wanted the Clinton campaign doing more in the rural white pockets of the state saying quote, \"We had the resources to do both. The campaign -- and this was coming from her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn -- didn't want to do it.\"\n\n\n\nDo you think that this is also a large part of what happened?\n\n\n\nMOORE: Yes. I think that also is part of it.\n\n\n\nI think how many months was it before she hadn't been to Wisconsin? I know she hadn't been to Michigan. There was a rush trip at the end there to Grand Rapids.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, I mean, where I come from -- I live in Michigan, so we're used to both parties. The Republican Party, which controls the state House and the governor in Michigan has contributed to poisoning the people of Flint and still hasn't fixed the problem. So we're used to the treatment of that party.\n\n\n\nWe're also used to the neglect, the benign neglect from Democrats or I should say the old school Democrats who basically -- once they get in have a hard time dealing with, especially cities that have large minority populations or in the cases of say Flint or Detroit, these are majority black cities and they largely go ignored (ph). They get a lot of lip service.\n\n\n\nAnd the funny thing is that Donald Trump kind of saw that and made that point, even though he will be the last person to visit Detroit or Flint to help us. And I think that the people that voted for him in Michigan are going to again be up for another rude awakening when they realize he's going to not do a damn thing to make the situation better and probably will make it worse.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Obviously a lot of people who supported Hillary Clinton are trying to deal with this new world order. Oprah Winfrey, for example, making headlines angering a lot of Clinton supporters with comments that she made about Trump and Obama.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOPRAH WINFREY, TALK SHOW HOST: I just saw president-elect Trump with president Obama in the White House, and it gave me hope.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.\n\n\n\nWINFREY: It gave me hope. I mean, I have to say, just to hear president-elect Trump say that he had respect for President Obama, it felt that he had reached a moment where he was actually humbled by that experience. I think everybody can take a deep breath.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: What do you think?\n\n\n\nMOORE: Well, that's why we love Oprah.\n\n\n\nSomebody needs to say that. We do need hope. I was hope. I was hopeful when I saw the two of them there because Trump looked like he didn't belong there. And he felt so uncomfortable in his own skin sitting there in that chair, you know, just like -- and Obama, I think we counted 15 o 16 ums as he was trying say something nice.\n\n\n\nLook, that's the side show that has to happen in a week like this. But frankly, you know, Democrats would be better off if they ran Oprah or Tom Hanks or -- why don't we run beloved people? We have so many of them.\n\n\n\nThe Republicans do this. They run Reagan and the terminator and other people. Why don't we, why don't we run somebody that the American people love? That they are really drawn to and they're smart and have good politics and all that. Why don't Democrats do that?\n\n\n\nI'm telling you, Jake, my sincere hope is that the DNC that there is a clean sweep in this party. They all have to go, and they have to make room for the progressive Democrats who are going to come in here, are going to be needed to fight the things that Trump is going to do to the people of this country and the world. And we need young people, and women, and others who are going to really be the voice of this party.\n\n\n\nNot the same old, same old -- clearly people wanted change. I think everybody has admitted that and clearly Bernie Sanders represented that. And you know, I was -- I was at the demonstration yesterday and there were Trump people there on the sidewalk. And I went over and talked to them and I said, you know, would you have considered voting for Bernie Sanders? And they said yes, they were just mad at the system.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Well let me ask you this, so that's the big question, what did Democrats do going forward organizationally, do they double down on progressive views the kind espoused by Bernie Sanders? Do they try to reach out to somebody who understands the working class white voters that voted for Donald Trump in droves? A fight already under way for the DNC chair. Several people have put their names forward including Howard Dean, Martin O'Malley, Congressman Keith Ellison who has the support of Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer.\n\n\n\nWho do you think the party should go with?\n\n\n\nMOORE: Keith Ellison. That is the exact way to go. That is the future.\n\n\n\n[09:50:01]\n\n\n\nWe live -- we live -- the fear that I think a lot of white voters have is that they know the truth, which is that as the census bureau says, before 2050, white people are going to be the minority in this country. MOORE: For the last two Septembers now, the majority of kindergartners entering school in America are not white. That's the new America and we need to have a party that's going to represent the majority here that's in the future and not the past.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: All right.\n\n\n\nMOORE: So I hope that that happens. But people need to be out in the streets and not -- it's not just about the white working class. Right now all white people need to be concerned about how afraid Muslims, African-Americans, Hispanics are right now.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: I need to cut you off, I'm sorry.\n\n\n\nMOORE: I know. I'm so sorry. No, no. I just wanted to make that appeal because...\n\n\n\nTAPPER: OK.\n\n\n\nMOORE: ... I worry about what's ahead.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: A lot of people out there are very worried. Donald Trump -- thank you so much, Michael Moore. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nMOORE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Donald Trump spent the last year and a half running an unconventional campaign. Should we expect the same from his inauguration. The pump (ph), the circumstance, the \"State of the Cartoonion\" coming up next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:55:12]\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Welcome back. President-elect Trump is preparing for the Oval Office and his inauguration, so what should we expect when he takes the oath?

Now, you can bet that Beyonce will not be there serenading him on the steps of the Capitol as she did back in 2013.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I don't need Beyonce.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You're more likely, in fact, to see Trump supporter Ted Nugent.\n\n\n\nTED NUGENT, MUSICIAN: I've got your blue state right here, baby.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: The fact that the inaugural parade usually heads straight down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House means the president-elect will march right by his new Trump hotel. It's already sold out for inauguration day as the hotel website promises \"Washington will never be the same.\"\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Thanks for watching.\n\n\n\n\"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\" is next.\n\n\n\n", "comment_3": "2008\nThey get bitter, they cling to guns or religion.\n*Obama\n\nCondescending lectures &amp; crippling regulation only fu\u2026 https://t.co/A7PvXuP1QM", "split": "train"}

If this bill\u2026 https://t.co/H7pB7JRAxU", "target": "real", "comment_1": "That big spending bill that Congress is passing includes that long-controversial IMF quota and governance reform", "article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidates Barack Obama and John McCain fought vigorously over who would be toughest on congressional earmarks.\n\n\"We need earmark reform,\" Obama said in September during a presidential debate in Oxford, Miss. \"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama should prepare to carve out a lot of free time and keep the coffee hot this week as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice.\n\nThe bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks \u2014 loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress \u2014 were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees.\n\nSo while Obama and McCain were slamming earmarks on the campaign trail, House and Senate members \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 were slapping them into spending bills.\n\n\"It will be a little embarrassing for the president if he signs a bill with that many earmarks on it,\" said Stan Collender, a veteran Washington budget analyst. \"He'll say they're left over from the Bush years, and he as to say that next year the bill will be clean.\"\n\nExperts agree that most earmarks are legitimate. Cary Leahey, senior economist with Decision Economics in New York, said the nation's economic crisis is a contributing factor to the plethora of earmarks. Lawmakers can argue that for a relatively small price they've helped boost the economy.\n\n\"One congressman's earmark is another legislative way to fix a serious problem in his district,\" Leahey said.\n\nKenneth Thomas, a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, agrees.\n\n\"I generally believe that the priority is getting money into the system sooner rather than later, especially if it's for projects that will use local contractors and create jobs,\" he said.\n\nStill, it wasn't supposed to be this way. Earmarks have come under fire because of those that seem to provide what Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls \"laugh lines,\" such as Alaska's \"Bridge to Nowhere\" or North Dakota's Lawrence Welk Museum.\n\nObama pledged to take a hard hand on earmarks and warned lawmakers in a Feb. 3 letter from Budget Director Peter Orszag not to decorate the recently signed $787.2 billion stimulus bill with them.\n\nDemocrats declared the bill earmark-free. Republicans disagreed.\n\n\"While this bill does not include traditional earmarks, we should all understand that there are earmarks in this bill,\" said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. \"There is $850 million ... to bail out Amtrak, a $75 million earmark for the Smithsonian, a $1 billion earmark for the 2010 census.\"\n\nDemocrats have been trying to revamp the earmark process for about two years. In 2007, they instituted a system that required members to explain the contents of each earmark, as well as a justification for why it was included in the legislation that way. They claimed this led to a reduction in earmarks by as much as 43 percent.\n\nBut critics contended the system still had problems. Simply making information more available, they said, didn't address the major criticism: That such projects should go through the regular legislative process, subject to detailed hearings and bipartisan votes.\n\nNot only does this mean the public has no chance to challenge questionable spending, but too often powerful interests who know how to work the system get favorite measures inserted.\n\nFor instance, Congressional Quarterly reported recently that more than 100 House members got earmarks for clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm with close ties to Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who heads the powerful defense spending subcommittee. The CQ Politics analysis said that in the 2009 defense spending bill, which Congress approved last year, PMA clients got about $300 million.\n\nThe CQ study came after reports that the FBI is investigating the possibility of illegal campaign contributions by PMA to Murtha and other lawmakers.

You have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time.Let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague, Haleh Esfandiari, and her family. I have made my position known to the Iranian government. It is time for Haleh to be released. It is time for Haleh to come home.Thanks to the 9/11 Commission, we know that six years ago this week President Bush received a briefing with the headline: \"Bin Ladin determined to strike in U.S.\"It came during what the Commission called the \"summer of threat,\" when the \"system was blinking red\" about an impending attack. But despite the briefing, many felt the danger was overseas, a threat to embassies and military installations. The extremism, the resentment, the terrorist training camps, and the killers were in the dark corners of the world, far away from the American homeland.Then, one bright and beautiful Tuesday morning, they were here.I was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown Chicago when I heard the news on my car radio: a plane had hit the World Trade Center. By the time I got to my meeting, the second plane had hit, and we were told to evacuate.People gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the Sears Tower, transformed from a workplace to a target. We feared for our families and our country. We mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens. Back at my law office, I watched the images from New York: a plane vanishing into glass and steel; men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go; tall towers crumbling to dust. It seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud, blocking out the September sun.What we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats, we are no longer protected by our own power. And what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation.The history of America is one of tragedy turned into triumph. And so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free. An attack on Pearl Harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the Atlantic and Pacific. An Iron Curtain was punctured by democratic values, new institutions at home, and strong international partnerships abroad.After 9/11, our calling was to write a new chapter in the American story. To devise new strategies and build new alliances, to secure our homeland and safeguard our values, and to serve a just cause abroad. We were ready. Americans were united. Friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us. We had the might and moral-suasion that was the legacy of generations of Americans. The tide of history seemed poised to turn, once again, toward hope.But then everything changed.We did not finish the job against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy, or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists' base of support. We did not reaffirm our basic values, or secure our homeland.Instead, we got a color-coded politics of fear. Patriotism as the possession of one political party. The diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries. A rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st century's stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state. A deliberate strategy to misrepresent 9/11 to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11.And so, a little more than a year after that bright September day, I was in the streets of Chicago again, this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in Iraq. I did not oppose all wars, I said. I was a strong supporter of the war in Afghanistan. But I said I could not support \"a dumb war, a rash war\" in Iraq. I worried about a \" U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences\" in the heart of the Muslim world. I pleaded that we \"finish the fight with bin Ladin and al Qaeda.\"The political winds were blowing in a different direction. The President was determined to go to war. There was just one obstacle: the U.S. Congress. Nine days after I spoke, that obstacle was removed. Congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the President the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day. With that vote, Congress became co-author of a catastrophic war. And we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create, and no plan for how to get out.Because of a war in Iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11.According to the National Intelligence Estimate, the threat to our homeland from al Qaeda is \"persistent and evolving.\" Iraq is a training ground for terror, torn apart by civil war. Afghanistan is more violent than it has been since 2001. Al Qaeda has a sanctuary in Pakistan. Israel is besieged by emboldened enemies, talking openly of its destruction. Iran is now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the United States in the Middle East in a generation. Groups affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda operate worldwide. Six years after 9/11, we are again in the midst of a \"summer of threat,\" with bin Ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in the United States.What's more, in the dark halls of Abu Ghraib and the detention cells of Guantanamo, we have compromised our most precious values. What could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power. A tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us.It is time to turn the page. It is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11.Just because the President misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them. The terrorists are at war with us. The threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, but the threat is real. They distort Islam. They kill man, woman and child; Christian and Hindu, Jew and Muslim. They seek to create a repressive caliphate. To defeat this enemy, we must understand who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for.The President would have us believe that every bomb in Baghdad is part of al Qaeda's war against us, not an Iraqi civil war. He elevates al Qaeda in Iraq -- which didn't exist before our invasion -- and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits in Pakistan. He lumps together groups with very different goals: al Qaeda and Iran, Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents. He confuses our mission.And worse -- he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight. Bin Ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas. But they can provoke the reaction we've seen in Iraq: a misguided invasion of a Muslim country that sparks new insurgencies, ties down our military, busts our budgets, increases the pool of terrorist recruits, alienates America, gives democracy a bad name, and prompts the American people to question our engagement in the world.By refusing to end the war in Iraq, President Bush is giving the terrorists what they really want, and what the Congress voted to give them in 2002: a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.It is time to turn the page. When I am President, we will wage the war that has to be won, with a comprehensive strategy with five elements: getting out of Iraq and on to the right battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan; developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world's most deadly weapons; engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism; restoring our values; and securing a more resilient homeland.The first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in Iraq, and taking the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.I introduced a plan in January that would have already started bringing our troops out of Iraq, with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31, 2008. If the President continues to veto this plan, then ending this war will be my first priority when I take office.There is no military solution in Iraq. Only Iraq's leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of Iraq's civil war. We must apply pressure on them to act, and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence. And we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability.In ending the war, we must act with more wisdom than we started it. That is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al Qaeda within Iraq. But we must recognize that al Qaeda is not the primary source of violence in Iraq, and has little support -- not from Shia and Kurds who al Qaeda has targeted, or Sunni tribes hostile to foreigners. On the contrary, al Qaeda's appeal within Iraq is enhanced by our troop presence.Ending the war will help isolate al Qaeda and give Iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out. It will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to Afghanistan. Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need\u00e2\u0080\u0094and deserve. As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country.As President, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counter-terrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban. As we step up our commitment, our European friends must do the same, and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered NATO's efforts. We must also put more of an Afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the Afghan Army and Police, and including Afghan soldiers in U.S. and NATO operations.We must not, however, repeat the mistakes of Iraq. The solution in Afghanistan is not just military -- it is political and economic. As President, I would increase our non-military aid by $1 billion. These resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary Afghans, including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers. And we must seek better performance from the Afghan government, and support that performance through tough anti-corruption safeguards on aid, and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country.Above all, I will send a clear message: we will not repeat the mistake of the past, when we turned our back on Afghanistan following Soviet withdrawal. As 9/11 showed us, the security of Afghanistan and America is shared. And today, that security is most threatened by the al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwest Pakistan.Al Qaeda terrorists train, travel, and maintain global communications in this safe-haven. The Taliban pursues a hit and run strategy, striking in Afghanistan, then skulking across the border to safety.This is the wild frontier of our globalized world. There are wind-swept deserts and cave-dotted mountains. There are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map, and governments as forces that come and go. There are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience, and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence. It's a tough place.But that is no excuse. There must be no safe-haven for terrorists who threaten America. We cannot fail to act because action is hard.As President, I would make the hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Pakistan conditional, and I would make our conditions clear: Pakistan must make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.And Pakistan needs more than F-16s to combat extremism. As the Pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas, my Administration will increase America's commitment. We must help Pakistan invest in the provinces along the Afghan border, so that the extremists' program of hate is met with one of hope. And we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair -- our goal is not simply an ally in Pakistan, it is a democratic ally.Beyond Pakistan, there is a core of terrorists -- probably in the tens of thousands -- who have made their choice to attack America. So the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down, capture or kill terrorists around the world, and to deny them the world's most dangerous weapons.I will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to America. This requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the Army and Marine Corps's new counter-insurgency manual. I will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists. We need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same. This must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages, understand different cultures, and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies.To succeed, we must improve our civilian capacity. The finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. But it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions -- sometimes in dangerous places. As President, I will strengthen these civilian capacities, recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge. I will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts, and other civilians who can work alongside our military. We can't just say there is no military solution to these problems. We need to integrate all aspects of American might.One component of this integrated approach will be new Mobile Development Teams that bring together personnel from the State Department, the Pentagon, and USAID. These teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples' lives, and to turn the tide against extremism. Where people are most vulnerable, where the light of hope has grown dark, and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity -- that is where these teams will go.I will also strengthen our intelligence. This is about more than an organizational chart. We need leadership that forces our agencies to share information, and leadership that never -- ever -- twists the facts to support bad policies. But we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information, and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks.This cannot just be an American mission. Al Qaeda and its allies operate in nearly 100 countries. The United States cannot steal every secret, penetrate every cell, act on every tip, or track down every terrorist -- nor should we have to do this alone. This is not just about our security. It is about the common security of all the world.As President, I will create a Shared Security Partnership Program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands of Indonesia, to the sprawling cities of Africa. This program will provide $5 billion over three years for counter-terrorism cooperation with countries around the world, including information sharing, funding for training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and targeting terrorist financing. And this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics, because brutality breeds terror, it does not defeat it.We must also do more to safeguard the world's most dangerous weapons. We know al Qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon. We know they would not hesitate to use one. Yet there is still about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium, some of it poorly secured, at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries. There are still about 15,000 to 16,00 nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across 11 time zones in the former Soviet Union.That is why I worked in the Senate with Dick Lugar to pass a law that would help the United States and our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction. That is why I am introducing a bill with Chuck Hagel that seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And that is why, as President, I will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years. While we work to secure existing stockpiles, we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material.And I won't hesitate to use the power of American diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror. The lesson of the Bush years is that not talking does not work. Go down the list of countries we've ignored and see how successful that strategy has been. We haven't talked to Iran, and they continue to build their nuclear program. We haven't talked to Syria, and they continue support for terror. We tried not talking to North Korea, and they now have enough material for 6 to 8 more nuclear weapons.It's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action. It's time to turn the page on Washington's conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that Presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear.President Kennedy said it best: \"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\" Only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them. As President, I will work with our friend and allies, but I won't outsource our diplomacy in Tehran to the Europeans, or our diplomacy in Pyongyang to the Chinese. I will do the careful preparation needed, and let these countries know where America stands. They will no longer have the excuse of American intransigence. They will have our terms: no support for terror and no nuclear weapons.But America must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons, or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill. That is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism.When you travel to the world's trouble spots as a United States Senator, much of what you see is from a helicopter. So you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camp in Darfur, the flood near Djibouti, the bombed out block in Baghdad. You see thousands of desperate faces.Al Qaeda's new recruits come from Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world. And it makes you stop and wonder: when those faces look up at an American helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?We know where extremists thrive. In conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy. In weak states that cannot control their borders or territory, or meet the basic needs of their people. From Africa to central Asia to the Pacific Rim -- nearly 60 countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse. The extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate-filled websites.And we know what the extremists say about us. America is just an occupying Army in Muslim lands, the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at Abu Ghraib, the power behind the throne of a repressive leader. They say we are at war with Islam. That is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame -- blame America, blame progress, blame Jews. And often he offers something along with the hate. A sense of empowerment. Maybe an education at a madrasa, some charity for your family, some basic services in the neighborhood. And then: a mission and a gun.We know we are not who they say we are. America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil. We are not at war with Islam. America is a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people. The vast majority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims have no use for bin Ladin or his bankrupt ideas. But too often since 9/11, the extremists have defined us, not the other way around.When I am President, that will change. We will author our own story.We do need to stand for democracy. And I will. But democracy is about more than a ballot box. America must show -- through deeds as well as words -- that we stand with those who seek a better life. That child looking up at the helicopter must see America and feel hope.As President, I will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate. Freedom must mean freedom from fear, not the freedom of anarchy. I will never shrug my shoulders and say -- as Secretary Rumsfeld did -- \"Freedom is untidy.\" I will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems, honest police forces, and financial systems that are transparent and accountable. Freedom must also mean freedom from want, not freedom lost to an empty stomach. So I will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy.I will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to $50 billion by 2012. And I will support a $2 billion Global Education Fund to counter the radical madrasas -- often funded by money from within Saudi Arabia -- that have filled young minds with messages of hate. We must work for a world where every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy. And as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in Europe and Asia as well -- more support for our diplomacy, more support for multilateral peacekeeping, and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict.I will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my Administration, not a small group of political officials at the State Department explaining a misguided war. We will open \"America Houses\" in cities across the Islamic world, with Internet, libraries, English lessons, stories of America's Muslims and the strength they add to our country, and vocational programs. Through a new \" America's Voice Corps\" we will recruit, train, and send out into the field talented young Americans who can speak with -- and listen to -- the people who today hear about us only from our enemies.As President, I will lead this effort. In the first 100 days of my Administration, I will travel to a major Islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle. I will make clear that we are not at war with Islam, that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future, and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence. I will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter, and my message will be clear: \"You matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\"This brings me to the fourth step in my strategy: I will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over.Major General Paul Eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country. It included training the Iraqi Army. After Abu Ghraib, his senior Iraqi advisor came into his office and said: \"You have no idea how this will play out on the streets of Baghdad and the rest of the Arab world. How can this be?\" This was not the America he had looked up to.As the counter-insurgency manual reminds us, we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side. But because the Administration decided to take the low road, our troops have more enemies. Because the Administration cast aside international norms that reflect American values, we are less able to promote our values. When I am President, America will reject torture without exception. America is the country that stood against that kind of behavior, and we will do so again.I also will reject a legal framework that does not work. There has been only one conviction at Guantanamo. It was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism. The sentence was 9 months. There has not been one conviction of a terrorist act. I have faith in America's courts, and I have faith in our JAGs. As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Our Constitution and our Uniform Code of Military Justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists.This Administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand. I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.That means no more illegal wire-tapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are. And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists. The FISA court works. The separation of powers works. Our Constitution works. We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers, and that justice is not arbitrary.This Administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security. It is not. There are no short-cuts to protecting America, and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland.Too often this Administration's approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices, or to scare Americans without telling them what to be scared of, or what to do. A Department set up to make Americans feel safer didn't even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in New Orleans. That's not acceptable.My Administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk. I will establish a Quadrennial Review at the Department of Homeland Security -- just like at the Pentagon -- to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them. And I will develop a comprehensive National Infrastructure Protection Plan that draws on both local know-how and national priorities.We have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable. That means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants. Improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports. And making sure our energy sector -- our refineries and pipelines and power grids -- is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy.We also have to get past a top-down approach. Folks across America are the ones on the front lines. On 9/11, it was citizens -- empowered by their knowledge of the World Trade Center attacks -- who protected our government by heroically taking action on Flight 93 to keep it from reaching our nation's capital. When I have information that can empower Americans, I will share it with them.Information sharing with state and local governments must be a two-way street, because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together -- the tip from Afghanistan, and the cop who sees something suspicious on Michigan Avenue. I will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government. I will address the problem in our prisons, where the most disaffected and disconnected Americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al Qaeda and its ideological allies.And my Administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires, or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes. We've been through that on 9/11. We've been through it during Katrina. I will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when American lives are at stake.But this effort can't just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform. It can't just be about how we spend our time or our money.It's about the kind of country we are.We are in the early stages of a long struggle. Yet since 9/11, we've heard a lot about what America can't do or shouldn't do or won't even try. We can't vote against a misguided war in Iraq because that would make us look weak, or talk to other countries because that would be a reward. We can't reach out to the hundreds of millions of Muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us. We can't protect the homeland because there are too many targets, or secure our people while staying true to our values. We can't get past the America of Red and Blue, the politics of who's up and who's down.That is not the America that I know.The America I know is the last, best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter. It's the country that put a man on the moon; that defeated fascism and helped rebuild Europe. It's a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies, but rather by the power of our ideals, and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home.That's the America I know. We just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the American story. If we do, we can keep America safe while extending security and opportunity around the world. We can hold true to our values, and in doing so advance those values abroad. And we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be: the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny, and the light of hope to the world.To make this story reality, it's going to take Americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country. It's going to take the service of a new generation of young people. It's going to take facing tragedy head-on and turning it into the next generation's triumph. That is a challenge that I welcome. Because when we do make that change, we'll do more than win a war -- we'll live up to that calling to make America, and the world, safer, freer, and more hopeful than we found it.As prepared for delivery", "comment_3": "Newt Gingrich: \"We are entering a dark period where freedom of speech becomes intimidation by the left...\u201d  The Dem\u2026 https://t.co/TQ0uHQKglY", "split": "train"}

The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias.\n\n\n\nNews coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama\u2019s \"first television interview in the White House,\" according to the New York Times, and \"his first formal television interview as president,\" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president\u2019s first.\n\n\n\nThe Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama\u2019s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s fair to say this was Obama\u2019s first interview as president.\n\n\n\nNo apology\n\n\n\nThe interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nObama responds:\n\nWell, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals.\n\nAnd so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response.\n\nUltimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table.\n\nAnd it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.\n\nThe ad uses only his comments, \"Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.\" But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we don\u2019t agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect.\n\n\n\nLater, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, \"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.\"\n\n\n\nNowhere in the interview did Obama use the word \"apology,\" \"apologize\" or \"sorry.\"\n\n\n\nPolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world.\n\n\n\nBut again, there isn\u2019t an \"I\u2019m sorry\" anywhere to be found in Obama\u2019s speeches or remarks. One expert we\u2019ve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.\n\n\n\n\"It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,\" John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. \"Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.\"\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nSecure America Now\u2019s ad says, \"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology.\" The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that.\n\n\n\nBy saying \"all too often the United States starts by dictating,\" Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. What\u2019s more, the ad criticizes Obama\u2019s approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n\n\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "comment_3": "Mitt Romney says Barack Obama 'could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not.' http://t.co/QrTDQDbJ via @politifact", "split": "train"}

(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nThe House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law \u2014 and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obama's failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for \"voluntary return\" to their home countries.\n\nA law known as the \"William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\" gave that right only to children from counties \"contiguous\" to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 among other parts of Central America \u2014 Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms. \"All the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,\" Cuellar told a group of reporters. \"The only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.\"\n\nMembers of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.\n\n\"We agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,\" they wrote, \"and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\"\n\nCuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with \"a little bit of experience\" \u2014 a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican \u2014 would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.\n\nObama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.\n\nBut most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.\n\n\"I think there's ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \"I think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.\"\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday \u2014 and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.\n\nHe said he had \"suspected all along\" that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama's pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.\n\n\"We need to take a position that protects children,\" Grijalva said, \"and a Republican effort ... to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.\"\n\nRelated stories: President's Party Asks Why He's Avoiding the Border Obama 'Happy to Consider' Sending National Guard to Border to get Votes on Supplemental A Tale of Two Congressional Visits to the Southwest Border Obama\u2019s Bill for Border Surge Gets Frosty Reception on the Right Obama Asking Congress for $4.3 Billion for Border Crisis, Wildfires On Climate Change, Landrieu Stands With Coal, Against Obama Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "comment_3": "GOP Task Force, Lone Democrat Eye Trafficking Law http://t.co/lKRshwqU5K via @rollcall", "split": "train"}

Mississippi's new voter ID law was put to its first test in Tuesday\u2019s primaries. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nNote: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.\n\nVoter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.\n\nPart of this litigation \u2014 and any rational debate about the issue generally \u2014 hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.\n\nFirst, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don\u2019t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they\u2019re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.\n\n[Here\u2019s the completely legal way to \u2018rig\u2019 an election]\n\nSecond, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud \u2026 that ID laws aren\u2019t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.\n\nThis sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you\u2019ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren\u2019t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.\n\nInstead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.\n\nI\u2019ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I\u2019ve been following reports wherever they crop up.\n\n[New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans]\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.\n\nSome of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I\u2019d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.\n\nIn just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn\u2019t include voters without ID who didn\u2019t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?\n\nCorrection: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.\n\nCredible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls\n\nNote: tracking the allegations \u2014 even those that may end up disproven \u2014 can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not \u2014 please \u2014 examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.\n\nMay 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others\u2019 names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.

June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX.

Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, \u201caffidavit ballots\u201d) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister\u2019s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four \u201crecent\u201d voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals\u2019 deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]\n\nCredible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement\n\n(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)\n\nNov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother\u2019s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki\u2019s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver\u2019s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter\u2019s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver\u2019s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister\u2019s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver\u2019s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Pe\u00f1a was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Pe\u00f1a was apparently given someone else\u2019s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Pe\u00f1a\u2019s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else\u2019s voter registration card, and claimed that \u201cthey had people that worked the election on their side.\u201d Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin\u2019s request, she signed her cousin\u2019s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to \u201cgo in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.\u201d It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown\u2019s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alism\u00e9, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver\u2019s license and a voter registration card in Alism\u00e9\u2019s name.[44]\n\n[1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.\n\n[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.\n\n[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php.\n\n[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.\n\n[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[8] N.C.

Alice Palmer, the longtime progressive activist from the city's South Side. And they kept challenging petitions until every one of Obama's four Democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot.\n\n\n\nFresh from his work as a civil rights lawyer and head of a voter registration project that expanded access to the ballot box, Obama launched his first campaign for the Illinois Senate saying he wanted to empower disenfranchised citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in that initial bid for political office, Obama quickly mastered the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics. His overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office, even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like Palmer.\n\n\n\nA close examination of Obama's first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career: The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it.\n\n\n\nOne of the candidates he eliminated, long-shot contender Gha-is Askia, now says that Obama's petition challenges belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusader for voter rights.\n\n\n\n\"Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates?\" Askia said. \"He talks about honor and democracy, but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot-free? Why not let the people decide?\"\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview, Obama granted that \"there's a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldn't create barriers to people getting on the ballot.\"\n\n\n\nBut the unsparing legal tactics were justified, he said, by obvious flaws in his opponents' signature sheets. \"To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,\" Obama recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I gave some thought to \u2026 should people be on the ballot even if they didn't meet the requirements,\" he said. \"My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether the district's primary voters were well-served by having only one candidate, Obama smiled and said: \"I think they ended up with a very good state senator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObama behind challenges\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnext\n\nAmerica has been defined in part by civil rights and good government battles fought out in Chicago's 13th District, which in 1996 spanned Hyde Park mansions, South Shore bungalows and poverty-bitten precincts of Englewood.It was in this part of the city that an eager reform Democrat by the name of Abner Mikva first entered elected office in the 1950s. And here a young, brash minister named Jesse Jackson ran Operation Breadbasket, leading marchers who sought to pressure grocery chains to hire minorities.Palmer served the district in the Illinois Senate for much of the 1990s. Decades earlier, she was working as a community organizer in the area when Obama was growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. She risked her safe seat to run for Congress and touted Obama as a suitable successor, according to news accounts and interviews.But when Palmer got clobbered in that November 1995 special congressional race, her supporters asked Obama to fold his campaign so she could easily retain her state Senate seat.Obama not only refused to step aside, he filed challenges that nullified Palmer's hastily gathered nominating petitions, forcing her to withdraw.\"I liked Alice Palmer a lot. I thought she was a good public servant,\" Obama said. \"It was very awkward. That part of it I wish had played out entirely differently.\"His choice divided veteran Chicago political activists.\"There was friction about the decision he made,\" said City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel Black, who tried to negotiate with Obama on Palmer's behalf. \"There were deep disagreements.\"Had Palmer survived the petition challenge, Obama would have faced the daunting task of taking on an incumbent senator. Palmer's elimination marked the first of several fortuitous political moments in Obama's electoral success: He won the 2004 primary and general elections for U.S. Senate after tough challengers imploded when their messy divorce files were unsealed.\n\nMore articles\n\nGet chicagotribune.com news by e-mail.

NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate. Here is a transcript of that debate.\n\nSen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate.\n\nBrokaw: Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates.\n\nFrom all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.\n\nNeither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we won't be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election.\n\nEach candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.\n\nThe only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\nGentlemen?\n\nGentlemen, we want to get under way immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.\n\nAs you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions.\n\nI understand that you flipped a coin.\n\nAnd, Sen. Obama, you will begin tonight. And we're going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Allen Shaffer.\n\nAllen?\n\nShaffer: With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what's the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin?\n\nObama: Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.\n\nI think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.\n\nAnd I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Sen. McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.\n\nIt hasn't worked out that way. And so now we've got to take some decisive action.\n\nNow, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We've got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.\n\nIt means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that's only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.\n\nIt means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.\n\nAnd then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Sen. Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.\n\nAnd, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. It's our job to fix the problem.\n\nNow, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much. We have to keep Americans' taxes low. All Americans' taxes low. Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.\n\nWe obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington. Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?\n\nWe've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.\n\nYou know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.\n\nIs it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.\n\nI know how the do that, my friends. And it's my proposal, it's not Sen. Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.\n\nBrokaw: Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he won't stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Not you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: No, with good reason.\n\nMcCain: You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.\n\nA supporter of Sen. Obama's is Warren Buffett [chairman of Berkshire Hathaway]. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.\n\nI like Meg Whitman [former CEO of eBay and current McCain campaign adviser], she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.\n\nBut the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrokaw: All right. Sen. McCain -- Sen. Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?\n\nObama: Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.\n\nProsperity is not just going to trickle down. We've got to help the middle class.\n\nAnd we've -- you know, Sen. McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Sen. McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.\n\nPart of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.\n\nAnd that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSen. McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, thank you very much.\n\nMay I remind both of you, if I can, that we're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so.\n\nWe're going to go now, Sen. McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark, who is over here in section F.\n\nOliver?\n\nClark: Well, Senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time. And through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.\n\nI left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.\n\nBut you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.\n\nBut you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.\n\nAnd you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change.\n\nMeanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Sen. Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.\n\nSo this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it's not enough. That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.\n\nBut Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.\n\nIf they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll. If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.\n\nAnd if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.\n\nSo it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action. But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.\n\nNow, I've got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain's history, not surprisingly. Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.\n\nSen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.\n\nI wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben] Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.\n\nA year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.\n\nAnd Sen. McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.\n\nNow, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Sen. McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.\n\nAnd I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Sen. McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.\n\nSo -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?\n\nThis is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.\n\nThe secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, time for a discussion. I'm going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?\n\nObama: No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.\n\nThe problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.\n\nBut most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?\n\nMcCain: I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.\n\nMy friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Sen. Obama's name was not on that letter.\n\nThe point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans' workers are the best in the world. They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.\n\nThey're the most innovative. They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters. We're the best importers. They're most effective. They are the best workers in the world.\n\nAnd we've got to give them a chance. They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you, Sen. McCain.\n\nWe're going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.\n\nSen. Obama, this is a question from you from Teresa Finch.\n\nTeresa?\n\nFinch: How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis?\n\nObama: Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car.\n\nThat's not what happens in Washington. And you're right. There is a lot of blame to go around.\n\nBut I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.\n\nWhen George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. It's now over $10 trillion. We've almost doubled it.\n\nAnd so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.\n\nSo here's what I would do. I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.\n\nYou know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.\n\nWe are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future. We've got to have a different energy plan.\n\nWe've got to invest in college affordability. So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts. And what I've proposed, you'll hear Sen. McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.\n\nThe key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests. We've got to put an end to that.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Theresa (ph), thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer.\n\nI have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Sen. [Russ] Feingold [D-Wisconsin] on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Sen. Lieberman on trying to address climate change.\n\nI have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Sen. Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform.\n\nAnd so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That's really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.\n\nI don't expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you'll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.\n\nDo you know that Sen. Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?\n\nHe voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?\n\nI think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.\n\nYou're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.\n\nBrokaw: We've run out of time. We have this one-minute discussion period going on here.\n\nThere are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: The three priorities were health...\n\nBrokaw: The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?\n\nMcCain: I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think it's very important that reform our entitlement programs.\n\nMy friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today. We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.\n\nI know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That's my clear record.\n\nWe can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.\n\nMy friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.\n\nAs far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That's the next issue.\n\nBut we can do them all at once. There's no -- and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.\n\nBrokaw: I'm trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion.\n\nSen. Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.\n\nObama: We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.\n\nEnergy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.\n\nSo we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.\n\nAnd we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one.\n\nHealth care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.\n\nAnd, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.\n\nBut just one point I want to make, Tom. Sen. McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records.\n\nSen. McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that's important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.\n\nBut understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Sen. McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.\n\nAnd so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you. That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.\n\nSen. McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiorra from Chicago.\n\nSince World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in?\n\nMcCain: Well, Fiorra, I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.\n\nI first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.\n\nI know a lot of them that aren't working. One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.\n\nI believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Sen. Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.\n\nAnd they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.\n\nSo we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.\n\nAnd some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.\n\nAnd, by the way, I want to go back a second.\n\nLook, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.\n\nFrankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, \"I'm sorry, you'll have to wait.\" I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nSen. Obama?\n\nObama: You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.\n\nAnd President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"\n\nThat wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.\n\nAnd so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.\n\nAnd let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.\n\nI believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.\n\nWe're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.\n\nBut each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.\n\nAnd that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.\n\nAnd the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.\n\nThat's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you'll remember, last summer, said that \"Wall Street got drunk.\"\n\nA lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.\n\nHow would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?\n\nObama: Well, I think it starts with Washington. We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \"Well, you know what? There's easy money out there.\"\n\nIt means -- and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Sen. McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.\n\nNow, when Sen. McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.\n\nAnd so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.\n\nI mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.\n\nAnd that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the- board freeze.\n\nThat's an example of an unfair burden sharing. That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.\n\nI want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Sen. McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.\n\nThat's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, you know, nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.\n\nBut he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.\n\nYou know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Sen. Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.\n\nSmall businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Sen. Obama's tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.\n\nI've got some news, Sen. Obama, the news is bad. So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.\n\nTo giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Sen. Obama's plan calls for. And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again. And let's not raise anybody's taxes.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, we have another question from the Internet.\n\nObama: Tom, can I respond to this briefly? Because...\n\nBrokaw: Well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this. This will address, I think, the next question.\n\nObama: The tax issue, because I think it's very important. Go ahead.\n\nBrokaw: There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position.\n\nSince the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.\n\nObama: Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly. We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.\n\nBut I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Sen. McCain, I think the \"Straight Talk Express\" lost a wheel on that one.\n\nSo let's be clear about my tax plan and Sen. McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.\n\nIf you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.\n\nAnd we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.\n\nNow, in contrast, Sen. McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.\n\nHe wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn't work.\n\nNow, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Sen. McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?\n\nMcCain: Sure. Hey, I'll answer the question. Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom. It's just...\n\nBrokaw: And Medicare.\n\nMcCain: ... tough decisions. I want to get to Medicare in a second.\n\nSocial Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. We've got to sit down together across the table. It's been done before.\n\nI saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts. That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.\n\nSen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I've taken them on. I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.\n\nSo Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher. It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.\n\nMy friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.\n\nLet's not let them fool with it anymore. There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, \"Fix it for us.\"\n\nNow, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Sen. Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.\n\nWhen he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?\n\nSo let's look at our record. I've fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government.\n\nLet's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we'll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much. I'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here.\n\nThe next question does come from the hall for Sen. McCain. It comes from Section C over here, and it's from Ingrid Jackson.\n\nIngrid?\n\nJackson: Sen. McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.\n\nBut when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.\n\nAnd I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That's the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.\n\nNow, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Sen. Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.\n\nLook, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nAnd -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Sen. Obama has opposed that.\n\nWe can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.\n\nWe can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.\n\nAnd it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.\n\nIt can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.\n\nAnd we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.\n\nAnd that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.\n\nBut this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.\n\nWhat Sen. McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.\n\nSo it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.\n\nOne last point I want to make on energy. Sen. McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.\n\nSo what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.\n\nWe're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.\n\nWe've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.\n\nBrokaw: Gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here. They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal...\n\nObama: I'm just trying to keep up with John.\n\nMcCain: Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.\n\nBrokaw: All right, Senator.\n\nHere's a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion. It's a simple question.\n\nMcCain: Sure.\n\nBrokaw: Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?\n\nMcCain: I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.\n\nBy the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.\n\nYou know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.\n\nI vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.\n\nThat's fundamental economics. We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.\n\nAnd as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Sen. Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAnd I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave. Thanks.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Senator.\n\nNext question for you, Sen. Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and it's from Lindsey Trella.\n\nLindsey?\n\nTrella: Senator, selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry.\n\nDo you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?\n\nObama: Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.\n\nIf you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.\n\nSo one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.\n\nSo here's what I would do. If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.\n\nAnd we're going to do it by investing in prevention. We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.\n\nIf you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Sen. McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.\n\nSo what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.\n\nIn fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\n\nThat, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need. We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you for the question. You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.\n\nAnd we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Let's have community health centers. Let's have walk-in clinics. Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.\n\nBut what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Sen. Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.\n\nIf you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Sen. Obama will fine you. Will fine you. That's remarkable. If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Sen. Obama will fine you.\n\nI want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.\n\nAnd if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.\n\nYou know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.\n\nObviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.\n\nBrokaw: Quick discussion. Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member. And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.\n\nBut government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about. But it is certainly my responsibility. It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. American citizens understand that. Employers understand that.\n\nBut they certainly are a little nervous when Sen. Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined. And, by the way, Sen. Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. Perhaps we might find that out tonight.\n\nObama: Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.\n\nBrokaw: Privilege, right or responsibility. Let's start with that.\n\nObama: Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.\n\nSo let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Sen. McCain through a lot of stuff out there.\n\nNumber one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor. There's no mandate involved.\n\nSmall businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.\n\nNow, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.\n\nAnd when Sen. McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.\n\nNow, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.\n\nAnd the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.\n\nThat's how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.\n\nAnd in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.\n\nThat is a fundamental difference that I have with Sen. McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That's what we've been going through for the last eight years. It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.\n\nBrokaw: Sen., we want to move on now. If we'd come back to the hall here, we're going to shift gears here a little bit and we're going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can...\n\nMcCain: I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?\n\nBrokaw: Phil Elliott is over here in this section, and Phil Elliott has a question for Sen. McCain.\n\nPhil?\n\nElliott: Yes. Sen. McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?\n\nMcCain: Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. And that is one of the challenges that America faces.\n\nBut having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism. I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.\n\nBut the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.\n\nSo we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.\n\nAnd that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.\n\nAnd I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.\n\nSen. Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.\n\nWe don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.\n\nObama: Well, you know, Sen. McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand.\n\nI don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.\n\nThat was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.\n\nWhen Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.\n\nThat was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.\n\nSo one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.\n\nBut it's also put an enormous strain on our budget. We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Sen. McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.\n\nWe're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.\n\nAnd we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Sen. McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.\n\nAnd the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.\n\nThat's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Sen. McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy. It has not worked for America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, let me ask you if -- let's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where there's a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security.\n\nTake the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia.\n\nWhat is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we don't have national security issues at stake?\n\nObama: Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.\n\nIf we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?\n\nIf we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.\n\nSo when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.\n\nAnd so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.\n\nBut understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world. We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.\n\nLet's take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWe could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.\n\nMcCain: Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Sen. Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which Gen. [David] Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.\n\nThere was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Sen. Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.\n\nThe United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.\n\nBut it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.\n\nWe went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.\n\nIn Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn't. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.\n\nSo you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way. And, again, I know those situations.\n\nI've been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.\n\nAnd I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won't take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nNext question for Sen. Obama, it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm. Katie?\n\nHamm: Should the United States respect Pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al Qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there, or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in Cambodia during the Vietnam War?\n\nObama: Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.\n\nSo what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.\n\nThey are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They're stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.\n\nThey are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end. So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.\n\nBut I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.\n\nWhat I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.\n\nAnd if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Katie (ph), thank you.\n\nYou know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick. Sen. Obama likes to talk loudly.\n\nIn fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable.\n\nYou know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.\n\nWhen you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.\n\nNow, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaeda, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.\n\nNow, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.\n\nNow, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people.\n\nWe need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.\n\nAnd by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.\n\nObama: Tom, just a...\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain...\n\nObama: ... just a quick follow-up on this. I think...\n\nMcCain: If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.\n\nBrokaw: No, I know. So but I think we get at it...\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me. It'd be fine with me.\n\nBrokaw: ... if I can, with this question.\n\nObama: Then let's have one.\n\nBrokaw: All right, let's have a follow-up.\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me.\n\nObama: Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.\n\nBrokaw: I'm just the hired help here, so, I mean...\n\nObama: You're doing a great job, Tom.\n\nLook, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said. Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan. Sen. McCain continues to repeat this.\n\nWhat I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.\n\nNow, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.\n\nMcCain: Thank you very much.\n\nObama: Sen. McCain, this is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea. That I don't think is an example of \"speaking softly.\"\n\nThis is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, \"Next up, Baghdad.\"\n\nSo I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly. And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties. We were not promoting democracy.\n\nThis is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.\n\nMcCain: And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...\n\nBrokaw: Yes, you get the...\n\nMcCain: ... to -- to -- to...\n\nBrokaw: ... last word here, and then we have to move on.\n\nMcCain: Not true. Not true. I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.\n\nI understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way. I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this. I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.\n\nBut the point is that I know how to handle these crises. And Sen. Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words. I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I'll get him. I know how to get him.\n\nI'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it. But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Sen. Obama did. And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.\n\nAnd we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.\n\nBrokaw: Can I get a quick response from the two of you about developments in Afghanistan this week? The senior British military commander, who is now leading there for a second tour, and their senior diplomatic presence there, Sherard Cowper-Coles, who is well known as an expert in the area, both have said that we're failing in Afghanistan.\n\nThe commander said we cannot win there. We've got to get it down to a low level insurgency, let the Afghans take it over. Cowper-Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator.\n\nIf either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize Afghanistan's strategy or do you? Briefly, if you can.\n\nObama: I'll be very brief. We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.\n\nGen. [David] McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.\n\nWe're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, \"You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.\"\n\nI don't think he has to be a dictator. And we want a democracy in Afghanistan. But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, briefly.\n\nMcCain: Gen. Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.\n\nAnd I've had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Sen. Obama is correct on.\n\nWe have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.\n\nBut most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Sen. Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.\n\nHe still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.\n\nAnd once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.\n\nSo I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, this question is for you from the Internet. It's from Alden in Hewitt, Texas.\n\nHow can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War?\n\nMcCain: First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.\n\nBut have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.\n\nNow, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.\n\nI said before, watch Ukraine. Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Georgia.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Ukraine. We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.\n\nWe have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.\n\nAnd so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.\n\nBut the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama.\n\nMcCain: It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama? We're winding down, so if we can keep track of the time.\n\nObama: Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Sen. McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.\n\nBut we can't just provide moral support. We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.\n\nThe other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners. We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.\n\nAnd you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.\n\nWe haven't been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Sen. McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.\n\nWe've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.\n\nAnd one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.\n\nBrokaw: This requires only a yes or a no. Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire. Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire?\n\nObama: I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Maybe.\n\nBrokaw: Maybe.\n\nMcCain: Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things. If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War. If I say no, it ignores their behavior.\n\nObviously energy is going to be a big, big factor. And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.\n\nBut the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.\n\nBrokaw: All right. We're going to try to get in two more questions, if we can. So we have to move along. Over in section A, Terry Shirey -- do I have that right, Terry?\n\nShirey: Senator, as a retired Navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country. I know both candidates, both of you, expressed support for Israel.\n\nIf, despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel, would you be willing to commit U.S. troops in support and defense of Israel? Or would you wait on approval from the U.N. Security Council?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Terry (ph). And thank you for your service to the country.\n\nI want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer. And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend. Thanks for serving.\n\nLet -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council. I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.\n\nAnd our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat. It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel. It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.\n\nIf Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up.\n\nWhat would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?\n\nNow, Sen. Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.\n\nI want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that.\n\nI think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.\n\nWe cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nAnd so it's unacceptable. And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.\n\nAnd we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.\n\nIt is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.\n\nAnd that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them.\n\nNow, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.\n\nIf you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.\n\nNow, it may not work. But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.\n\nWhen President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.\n\nWe've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, we've come to the last question.\n\nAnd you'll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and it's from a state that you're strongly contesting, both of you. It's from Peggy in Amherst, New Hampshire. And it has a certain Zen-like quality, I'll give you a fair warning.\n\nShe says, \"What don't you know and how will you learn it?\"\n\nSen. Obama, you get first crack at that.\n\nObama: My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do. And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.\n\nBut, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect. It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.\n\nBut here's what I do know. I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.\n\nDespite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.\n\nThe same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.\n\nAnd the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.\n\nWages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.\n\nAnd we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.\n\nWe need fundamental change. That's what's at stake in this election. That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.\n\nBut we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.\n\nThank you.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, you get the last word. Sen. Obama had the opening. You're last up.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.\n\nThe challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.\n\nThere are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.\n\nSo what I don't know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business. My mother basically raised our family.\n\nI know what it's like in dark times. I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times. I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.\n\nI know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.\n\nThat's what America's all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.\n\nAnd I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.\n\nThank you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Sen. McCain.\n\nThat concludes tonight's debate from here in Nashville. We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And you're in my way of my script there, if you will move.\n\nIn addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday, October 15, at Hofstra University in New York, moderated by my friend, Bob Schieffer of \"CBS News.\"\n\nThank you, Sen. McCain. Thank you, Sen. Obama.

The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable, and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office, he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan. John McCain Is Calling For A New Strategy In Afghanistan That Applies The Tried And True Principles Of Counter-Insurgency Used In The Iraq Surge. As President, John McCain will turn around the war in Afghanistan with a comprehensive strategy for victory. In Afghanistan, we need an integrated, nationwide civil-military campaign that is focused on providing security for the population. John McCain's Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan: John McCain Will Work With Our Allies To Ensure Unity Of Command In Afghanistan. One of the reasons there is no comprehensive campaign plan for Afghanistan is because there is no unity of command. Today, there are no less than three different American military combatant commands operating in Afghanistan, as well as NATO. The top commander in Afghanistan needs to be just that: the supreme commander of all coalition forces operating a successful counter-insurgency strategy that integrates all instructs of our national power. John McCain Will Appoint An Afghanistan Czar To Ensure Commanders Have What They Need To Win. Unity of command is a principle lacking in Washington. Too often, even as our soldiers and diplomats cooperate in the field, their superiors back home have been squabbling. Last year, the Administration took a step in the right direction and appointed a war czar. But the situation in Afghanistan demands a separate Czar based in the White House, reporting directly to the President and dedicated to the sole mission of ensuring we bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful end. John McCain Supports Sending At Least Three Additional Brigades To Afghanistan. Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available, and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them. John McCain Will Double The Size Of The Afghan Military. The Afghan army is already a great success story: a multiethnic, battle-tested fighting force. Yet, it's too small, with a projected strength of only 80,000 troops. We need to at least double the size of the Afghan army to 160,000 troops. To pay for this increase, the international community should share the costs. The United States and our allies should establish an international trust fund to provide long-term financing for the Afghan army. John McCain Will Increase Our Non-Military Assistance To The Afghan Government. Through a multi-front plan, we will increase assistance to the Afghan government to strengthen its institutions, the rule of law, and the economy. Essential to success of the mission in Afghanistan is getting control of narcotics trafficking. Alternative crops must be able to get to market and traffickers must be arrested and prosecuted by enhanced Special Courts. We should agree on specific governance and development benchmarks with the Afghan government and then work with them closely to ensure they are met. John McCain Will Enhance Our Regional Diplomatic Efforts By Appointing A Special Presidential Envoy. The violence in Afghanistan has many causes, but chief among them is the fact that the country is treated by some regional powers as a chessboard to pursue their own ambitions. John McCain will appoint a special presidential envoy to address disputes between Afghanistan and its neighbors. Our goal must be to turn Afghanistan from a theater for regional rivalries into a commons for regional cooperation. As Part Of This Regional Strategy, John McCain Will Put Special Focus On Pakistan. We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there. We must also empower the new civilian government of Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development, health, and education. ###\n\n", "comment_3": "Mr. President.  Sick of Putin.

Over the month, hires fell to 5.7 million and separations edged down to 5.5 million. Within separations, the quits and the layoffs and discharges rates were unchanged at 2.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires, and separations for the nonfarm sector by industry and by four geographic regions. Job Openings On the last business day of May, the job openings level was little changed at 7.3 million. The job openings rate was 4.6 percent. The number of job openings was little changed for total private and decreased for government (-54,000). The job openings level increased in other services (+77,000). Job openings decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in construction (-65,000), transportation, warehousing, and utilities (-60,000), and real estate and rental and leasing (-49,000). The number of job openings increased in the Northeast region. (See table 1.) Hires The number of hires decreased to 5.7 million (-266,000) in May. The hires rate was 3.8 percent. The hires level fell for total private (-262,000) and was little changed for government. Hires decreased in professional and business services (-129,000). The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See table 2.) Separations Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Total separations is referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore, the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers\u2019 willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations includes separations due to retirement, death, disability, and transfers to other locations of the same firm. The number of total separations edged down to 5.5 million (-192,000) in May. The total separations rate was 3.6 percent. The number of total separations edged down for total private (-204,000) and was little changed for government. The total separations level decreased in professional and business services (-95,000). The number of total separations decreased in the South region. (See table 3.) The number of quits was little changed in May at 3.4 million. The quits rate was 2.3 percent. The quits level edged down for total private (-117,000) and increased for government (+25,000). Quits decreased in professional and business services (-92,000) and real estate and rental and leasing (-16,000), but increased in state and local government education (+18,000). The number of quits decreased in the South region. (See table 4.) The number of layoffs and discharges was little changed in May at 1.8 million. The layoffs and discharges rate was 1.2 percent. The layoffs and discharges level was little changed for total private and for government. The number of layoffs and discharges increased in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+36,000). The layoffs and discharges level fell in the South region. (See table 5.) The number of other separations was little changed in May. The other separations level was little changed for total private and for government. Other separations decreased in professional and business services (-26,000), information (-10,000), and nondurable goods manufacturing (-7,000). The other separations level increased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (+8,000). The number of other separations fell in the West region. (See table 6.) Net Change in Employment Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining. Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in May, hires totaled 69.5 million and separations totaled 66.9 million, yielding a net employment gain of 2.6 million. These totals include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year. ____________ The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey estimates for June 2019 are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, August 6, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. (EDT).\n\nTable A.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects and compiles JOLTS data monthly from a sample of nonfarm establishments. A more detailed discussion of JOLTS concepts and methodology is available online at www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch18.pdf. Coverage and collection The JOLTS program covers all private nonfarm establishments, as well as federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data are collected for total employment, job openings, hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations. Concepts Industry classification. The industry classifications in this release are in accordance with the 2017 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Employment. Employment includes persons on the payroll who worked or received pay for the pay period that includes the 12th day of the reference month. Full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, seasonal, salaried, and hourly employees are included, as are employees on paid vacations or other paid leave. Proprietors or partners of unincorporated businesses, unpaid family workers, or persons on leave without pay or on strike for the entire pay period, are not counted as employed. Employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, and consultants are counted by their employer of record, not by the establishment where they are working. Job openings. Job openings information is collected for the last business day of the reference month. A job opening requires that: 1) a specific position exists and there is work available for that position, 2) work could start within 30 days whether or not the employer found a suitable candidate, and 3) the employer is actively recruiting from outside the establishment to fill the position. Included are full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, and seasonal openings. Active recruiting means that the establishment is taking steps to fill a position by advertising in newspapers or on the Internet, posting help-wanted signs, accepting applications, or using other similar methods. Jobs to be filled only by internal transfers, promotions, demotions, or recall from layoffs are excluded. Also excluded are jobs with start dates more than 30 days in the future, jobs for which employees have been hired but have not yet reported for work, and jobs to be filled by employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The job openings rate is computed by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of employment and job openings and multiplying that quotient by 100. Hires. The hires level is the total number of additions to the payroll occurring at any time during the reference month, including both new and rehired employees, full-time and part-time, permanent, short-term and seasonal employees, employees recalled to the location after a layoff lasting more than 7 days, on-call or intermittent employees who returned to work after having been formally separated, and transfers from other locations. The hires count does not include transfers or promotions within the reporting site, employees returning from strike, employees of temporary help agencies or employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The hires rate is computed by dividing the number of hires by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. Separations. The separations level is the total number of employment terminations occurring at any time during the reference month, and is reported by type of separation\u2014quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. (Some respondents are only able to report total separations.) The quits count includes voluntary separations by employees (except for retirements, which are reported as other separations). The layoffs and discharges count is comprised of involuntary separations initiated by the employer and includes layoffs with no intent to rehire; formal layoffs lasting or expected to last more than 7 days; discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings; firings or other discharges for cause; terminations of permanent or short-term employees; and terminations of seasonal employees. The other separations count includes retirements, transfers to other locations, deaths, and separations due to disability. The separations count does not include transfers within the same location or employees on strike. The separations rate is computed by dividing the number of separations by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. The quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations rates are computed similarly. Annual estimates. Annual levels for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 published monthly levels. Annual rates are computed by dividing the annual level by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) annual average employment level, and multiplying that quotient by 100. This figure will be approximately equal to the sum of the 12 monthly rates. Consistent with BLS practice, annual estimates are published only for not seasonally adjusted data and are released with the January news release each year. Annual estimates are not calculated for job openings because job openings are a stock, or point-in-time, measurement for the last business day of each month. Sample and estimation methodology The JOLTS survey design is a stratified random sample of 16,000 nonfarm business and government establishments. The sample is stratified by ownership, region, industry sector, and establishment size class. The establishments are drawn from a universe of over 9.1 million establishments compiled by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program which includes all employers subject to state unemployment insurance laws and federal agencies subject to the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program. JOLTS total employment estimates are benchmarked, or ratio adjusted, monthly to the strike-adjusted employment estimates of the CES survey. A ratio of CES to JOLTS employment is used to adjust the levels for all other JOLTS data elements. JOLTS business birth/death model As with any sample survey, the JOLTS sample can only be as current as its sampling frame. The time lag from the birth of an establishment until its appearance on the sampling frame is approximately one year. In addition, many of these new units may fail within the first year. Since these universe units cannot be reflected on the sampling frame immediately, the JOLTS sample cannot capture job openings, hires, and separations from these units during their early existence. To compensate for the inability to capture data from these establishments, BLS has developed a birth/death model that uses birth and death activity from previous years. The estimates of job openings, hires, and separations produced by the birth/death model are added to the sample-based estimates produced from the survey to arrive at the estimates for openings, hires, and separations. Seasonal adjustment BLS uses X-13 ARIMA to seasonally adjust several JOLTS series utilizing moving averages as seasonal filters. A concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology is used in which new seasonal adjustment factors are calculated each month, using all relevant data, up to and including current month data. JOLTS seasonal adjustment includes both additive and multiplicative models and REGARIMA (regression with auto- correlated errors) modeling to improve the seasonal adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for outliers in the series. Alignment procedure The JOLTS measures for hires minus separations can be used to derive a measure of net employment change. This change should be comparable to the net employment change from the much larger CES survey. However, definitional differences as well as sampling and nonsampling errors between the two surveys historically caused JOLTS to diverge from CES over time. To limit the divergence, and improve the quality of the JOLTS hires and separations series, BLS implemented the Monthly Alignment Method. This method applies the CES employment trends to the seasonally adjusted JOLTS implied employment trend (hires minus separations) forcing them to be approximately the same, while preserving the seasonality of the JOLTS data. First, the two series are seasonally adjusted and the difference between the JOLTS implied employment change and the CES net employment change is calculated. Next, the JOLTS implied employment change is adjusted to equal the CES net employment change through a proportional adjustment. This procedure adjusts the two components (hires, separations) proportionally to their contribution to the total churn (hires plus separations). The adjusted hires and separations are converted back to not seasonally adjusted data by reversing the application of the original seasonal factors. After the Monthly Alignment Method has been used to adjust the level estimates, rate estimates are computed from the adjusted levels. Reliability of the estimates JOLTS estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample is surveyed rather than the entire population, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the \"true\" population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies depending on the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. BLS analysis is generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. That means that there is a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the \"true\" population value because of sampling error. Sampling error estimates are available at www.bls.gov/jlt/jolts_median_standard_errors.htm. The JOLTS estimates also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to include a segment of the population, the inability to obtain data from all units in the sample, the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide data on a timely basis, mistakes made by respondents, errors made in the collection or processing of the data, and errors from the employment benchmark data used in estimation.

I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, \"We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,\" end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.\n\nOBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me? How's it going to affect my job? How's it going to affect my house? How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns. Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.\n\nLEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why. Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while. But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we've got a lot of work to do. And we've got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.\n\nLEHRER: All right, let's go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. We've got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?\n\nOBAMA: We haven't seen the language yet. And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that. But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.\n\nLEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: I -- I hope so. And I...\n\nLEHRER: As a United States senator...\n\nMCCAIN: Sure.\n\nLEHRER: ... you're going to vote for the plan?\n\nMCCAIN: Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae (NYSE:FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE:FRE) and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow we've lost that accountability. I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.\n\nLEHRER: Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis. I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street. And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place. And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.\n\nLEHRER: Say it directly to him.\n\nOBAMA: I do not think that they are.\n\nLEHRER: Say it directly to him.\n\nOBAMA: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And...\n\nMCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn't hear him? (LAUGHTER)\n\nLEHRER: I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I'm going to try.\n\nOBAMA: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on. They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven't been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.\n\nLEHRER: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you don't, tell him what you disagree with.\n\nMCCAIN: No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street. So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.\n\nLEHRER: All right, let's go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word \"fundamental,\" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It's completely out of control. It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway. It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen. This one's kind of old. I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.\n\nLEHRER: Senator Obama, two minutes.\n\nOBAMA: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me. But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.\n\nLEHRER: Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he... (CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: No, that's fine.\n\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. \"It's only $18 billion.\" Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It's a system that's got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.\n\nOBAMA: I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures. Let's just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But let's go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.\n\nOBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.\n\nLEHRER: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he's made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.\n\nMCCAIN: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, the United States of American business (OOTC:ARBU) pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it's rife. It's throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You'll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of \"rich.\"\n\nLEHRER: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that? OBAMA: Well, let me just make a couple of points.\n\nLEHRER: All right.\n\nOBAMA: My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. It's not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that's a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, you know, let me just...\n\nLEHRER: We've got to go to another lead question.\n\nMCCAIN: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.\n\nOBAMA: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.\n\nMCCAIN: You've got to look at our record. You've got to look at our records. That's the important thing. Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.\n\nOBAMA: That's not true, John. That's not true.\n\nMCCAIN: And that's just a fact. Again, you can look it up.\n\nOBAMA: Look, it's just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...\n\nMCCAIN: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.\n\nOBAMA: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. We've got an emergency bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.\n\nLEHRER: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about. And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it's going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?\n\nOBAMA: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy (OOTC:AEGC) , solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I'm meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education. We've got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can't shortchange those things. We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.\n\nLEHRER: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?\n\nMCCAIN: Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.\n\nMCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.\n\nLEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what you're saying?\n\nOBAMA: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...\n\nLEHRER: Like what?\n\nOBAMA: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project.\n\nLEHRER: Not willing to give that up?\n\nOBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn't work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I work with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.\n\nLEHRER: What I'm trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what I'm trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.\n\nMCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.\n\nLEHRER: Spending freeze?\n\nMCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans national defense and several other vital issues.\n\nLEHRER: Would you go for that?\n\nOBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.\n\nMCCAIN: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned and the issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with President Clinton.\n\nLEHRER: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?\n\nOBAMA: There's no doubt it will affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we' holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If we're lucky and do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm go doing have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make the tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and our priorities and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.\n\nOBAMA: I just want to make this point, Jim. John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.\n\nLEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama.\n\nMCCAIN: It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.\n\nLEHRER: All right. Let's go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?\n\nMCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.\n\nMCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadn't caught bin Laden. We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case. We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.\n\nLEHRER: Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?\n\nMCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. That's the decision of the next president of the United States. Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.\n\nLEHRER: Well, let's go at some of these things...\n\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing.\n\nLEHRER: What about that point?\n\nMCCAIN: I mean, it's remarkable.\n\nLEHRER: All right. What about that point?\n\nOBAMA: Which point? He raised a whole bunch of them.\n\nLEHRER: I know, OK, let's go to the latter point and we'll back up. The point about your not having been...\n\nOBAMA: Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole. But that's Senate inside baseball. But let's get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni. And you were wrong. And so my question is... (CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Senator Obama...\n\nOBAMA: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.\n\nLEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here...\n\nMCCAIN: I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad. General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom. I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don't want our kids coming back here. And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.\n\nOBAMA: That's not true.\n\nMCCAIN: They just passed an electoral...\n\nOBAMA: That's not true.\n\nMCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days. There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. They inform on the bad guys. And peace comes to the country, and prosperity. That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.\n\nLEHRER: Let me see...\n\nOBAMA: Jim, Jim, this is a big...\n\nMCCAIN: It was a stratagem. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOBAMA: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We've been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.\n\nMCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.\n\nOBAMA: That's not the case.\n\nMCCAIN: That's what ...\n\nOBAMA: What he said was a precipitous...\n\nMCCAIN: That's what Admiral Mullen said.\n\nOBAMA: ... withdrawal would be dangerous. He did not say that. That's not true.\n\nMCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground. Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed. And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.\n\nMCCAIN: It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.\n\nLEHRER: Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, we'll move to Afghanistan. (LAUGHTER) And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it's a -- it picks up on a point that's already been made. Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?\n\nOBAMA: Yes, I think we need more troops. I've been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though. It's not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I've said this to President Karzai. Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.\n\nLEHRER: Afghanistan, Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can't ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger. I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you don't do that. You don't say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. I've been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It's ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it's going to be tough. They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it's going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. So it's not just the addition of troops that matters. It's a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with him. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.\n\nOBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Here's what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy. And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult. This is not an easy situation. You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops. And we've got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.\" And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.\n\nMCCAIN: I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War. I supported -- I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way. And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \"Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.\" He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \"I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.\" And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \"But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.\" That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.\n\nMCCAIN: A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.\n\nOBAMA: Jim, let me just make a point. I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me ingrain bin green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through. No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that they've provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan. You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden. You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when I'm president, I will.\n\nLEHRER: New ...\n\nMCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.\n\nLEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you. You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we've been going at it ...\n\nOBAMA: A testimony to you, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: I don't know about that. But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we'll adjust as we get there. But the amount of time is even. New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat to Iran right now to the security of the United States?\n\nMCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot a second Holocaust. Let's just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I've consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now here's what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with some countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts of isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I'm president of the United States.\n\nLEHRER: Senator, what about talking?\n\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.\n\nOBAMA: So let's talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe. And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.\n\nOBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means \"without preconditions.\" It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, \"Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.\" There's a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks. They're a member of the axis of evil. We can't deal with them. And you know what happened? They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.\n\nMCCAIN: Of course.\n\nOBAMA: If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.\n\nMCCAIN: I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States. I don't even have a seal yet. Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad. He did not say that.\n\nOBAMA: Of course not.\n\nMCCAIN: He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. I've always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad. What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse,\" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. This is dangerous. It isn't just naive; it's dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag. We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into. And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's \"trust, but verify,\" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous.\n\nOBAMA: Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position. When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. Nobody is even talking about that.\n\nMCCAIN: So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, \"We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,\" and we say, \"No, you're not\"? Oh, please.\n\nOBAMA: No, let me tell... (CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue. I've known him for 35 years.\n\nOBAMA: We will take a look.\n\nMCCAIN: And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.\n\nOBAMA: Nobody's talking about that.\n\nMCCAIN: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. We do that all the time.\n\nLEHRER: We're going to go to a new... (CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.\n\nOBAMA: I am not parsing words.\n\nMCCAIN: He's parsing words, my friends.\n\nOBAMA: I'm using the same words that your advisers use. Please, go ahead.\n\nLEHRER: New lead question. Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama. How do you see the relationship with Russia? Do you see them as a competitor? Do you see them as an enemy? Do you see them as a potential partner?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, \"Both sides ought to show restraint.\" Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a \"K,\" a \"G,\" and a \"B.\" And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.\n\nMCCAIN: And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is -- this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, \"Vladimir Putin, our president.\" It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.\n\nLEHRER: You see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?\n\nOBAMA: No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn't done. But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil. So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.\n\nLEHRER: We've got time for one more lead question segment. We're way out of... (CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Quick response and then... (CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing. So...\n\nOBAMA: That's just not true, John. John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.\n\nMCCAIN: ... it's hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge. And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.\n\nOBAMA: I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.\n\nMCCAIN: So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...\n\nLEHRER: Excuse me, Senator.\n\nOBAMA: John?\n\nMCCAIN: ... I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't. That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.\n\nOBAMA: I -- I just have to correct the record here. I have never said that I object to nuclear waste. What I've said is that we have to store it safely. And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.\n\nLEHRER: All right.\n\nOBAMA: I've got to make this point, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: He objects...\n\nMCCAIN: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...\n\nOBAMA: He -- he -- he objects... (CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: One at a time, please.\n\nOBAMA: He objected...\n\nLEHRER: One at a time.\n\nMCCAIN: No one can be opposed to alternate energy.\n\nOBAMA: All right, fair enough. Let's move on. You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.\n\nLEHRER: This is the last -- last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain. What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?\n\nMCCAIN: I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go. And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes, Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites. We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. It's in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We can't simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That's going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.\n\nOBAMA: And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.\n\nLEHRER: Do you agree there's much to be done in a new administration to restore... (CROSSTALK)\n\nMCCAIN: But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, \"proven.\" That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War. We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq. The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile. And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.\n\nLEHRER: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, there's no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone. In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent. In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it. We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We haven't adequately funded veterans' care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, \"How can I get disability payments? I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment.\" So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. That's been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.\n\nMCCAIN: I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that I'll take care of them. And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them. And I'll take care of them. And they know that I'll take care of them. And that's going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I don't think I need any on-the-job training. I'm ready to go at it right now.\n\nOBAMA: Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. That's where I get my name. And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.\n\nLEHRER: Few seconds. We're almost finished.\n\nMCCAIN: Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home. I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.", "comment_3": "How NPR factchecked the first presidential debate in realtime, on top of a live transcript https://t.co/Y0HMJpOjez via @NiemanLab", "split": "train"}

Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\n\nBack in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n\nPhoto\n\nI didn\u2019t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone \u2014 not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 \u2014 shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what\u2019s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.\n\nSince 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion \u2014 a staggering $227.4 million on average \u2014 but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.\n\nThe taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn\u2019t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.\n\nTwelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country\u2019s finances. They\u2019ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It\u2019s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country\u2019s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.\n\nJob one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can\u2019t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.\n\nBut for those making more than $1 million \u2014 there were 236,883 such households in 2009 \u2014 I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more \u2014 there were 8,274 in 2009 \u2014 I would suggest an additional increase in rate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.

Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with \u201cradical\u201d positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That\u2019s what I believe,\u201d declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. \u201cI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that\u2019s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,\u201d Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would \u201cput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just totally against the whole shebang, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it\u2019s father has done to you, come on.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: \u201cDon\u2019t know yet, first thing\u2019s first here.

Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.\n\nAccording to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.\n\nWilliam Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\n\n\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.\n\nUpon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.\n\nPolice also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.\n\nIn addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.\n\nUpon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.\n\nVernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\n\n\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.\n\nAll three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.", "comment_3": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression https://t.co/2xopOnrFiL via @The Miami Gazette", "split": "train"}

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio\u2019s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.\n\nThe subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. \u201cThe most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,\u201d Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to \u201cwhat\u2019s in our hearts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, if you\u2019re a human living on this planet \u2014 which most of us are, yeah?\u201d she joked. \u201cAs long as we haven\u2019t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don\u2019t want to know if anyone has, I think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk\u2019s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, \u201cI did.\u201d\n\nHayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn\u2019t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll acknowledge he\u2019s crazy,\u201d the president said with a smile.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.\n\nIt\u2019s probably method acting, is what we\u2019re saying.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change.\n\nEarlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. \u201cUntil we invent the perfect energy source \u2014 Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty\u2019s there beaming us up \u2014 but until then we need to live in the real world,\u201d Obama said.", "comment_3": "Leonardo DiCaprio Says He Signed Up for Elon Musk's Deadly Mars Trip \u2026 https://t.co/uMKrIbE6me https://t.co/vCghSxPtOR", "split": "train"}

The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).\n\nAt 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA\u2019s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH.\n\nI am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong.

Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.\u201d\n\nClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.\n\nAl Gore\u2019s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 \u2013 a year that was touted as being \u201cthe hottest ever\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history \u2013 there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.\n\nDebunking the \u201c97 percent\u201d lie\n\nOn top of those \u201cinconvenient truths,\u201d the White House\u2019s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \u201c97 percent\u201d statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.\n\nMore objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.\n\nFrom the National Review:\n\n\u201cA 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\u201d\n\nAl Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax\n\nBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you\u2019re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 \u2013 largely due to investments in fake \u201cgreen tech\u201d companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.\n\nYou might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.\n\nUpdate: We have updated the headline to make it clear that the signatures of the petition were not all scientists.

If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRecognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace.\n\nBut, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump\u2019s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won\u2019t get the credit. \u201cRemember who decides this stuff,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c... The globalist elite would never give him that win.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.\n\nTrump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With \u201crocket man\u201d quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war.\n\nAfter the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\u201cI will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,\" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.\"\n\nIf that meeting and Friday\u2019s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends.\n\nLaura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday.\n\n\u201cWhen will we see the headline: \u201cTrump Ends the Korean War\u201d? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Ingraham said.\n\nIf Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger\u2019s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because \u201cpeace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,\u201d he said.\n\nOther controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of \u201chis extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"\n\nThe first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa.\n\nThere are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organization\u2019s website.

You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.\n\nOriginal post: There\u2019s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn\u2019t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.\n\nThe hacking and release of leading political figures\u2019 emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia\u2019s government. And it\u2019s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what \u201ccollusion\u201d between Donald Trump\u2019s team and the Russians might have involved.\n\nThat\u2019s not mere speculation. We\u2019ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don\u2019t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance \u2014 but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nThese hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn\u2019t just emails stolen, either \u2014 posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was \u201cprobably worth millions of dollars\u201d to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport.\n\nNo charges have been filed in the matter \u2014 yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified \u201cmore than six members of the Russian government\u201d involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe.\n\nTo understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself.\n\nHow the hacks happened (a phishing expedition)\n\nThe media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC\u2019s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly.\n\nThe full story is more complex. Let\u2019s start at the beginning.\n\nBetween March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The \u201cbaited lines\u201d they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:\n\nThese emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials \u2014 delivering them right into the hackers\u2019 hands.\n\nAccording to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors.\n\nParticularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just \u201ca handful\u201d of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers \u2014 along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others \u2014 had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)\n\nRussia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time \u2014 a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence agency. We don\u2019t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and \u2014 most famously \u2014 \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nCircumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine \u2014 at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine\u2019s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nThe Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin\u2019s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday \u2014 Moscow time.\n\nAround April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed \u201cCozy Bear\u201d) had been in the DNC\u2019s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we\u2019ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia\u2019s GRU \u2014 the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear \u2014 for taking \u201clarge volumes of data from the DNC.\u201d\n\nAs striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time.\n\nWhat came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms \u2014 the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts.\n\nA timeline of odd events between the hacks and the leaks\n\nThe backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election \u2014 the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin\u2019s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.\n\nIt was around this point \u2014 in mid-March 2016 \u2014 that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats\u2019 and Clinton campaign staffers\u2019 email accounts, according to SecureWorks\u2019 analysis.\n\nThere were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:\n\nApril 7: Putin condemns the Panama Papers leak . In early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers. Many of the documents revealed financial information about Putin\u2019s inner circle, and Putin publicly claimed the stories were part of a US plot against Russia. \u201cThey are trying to destabilize us from within in order to make us more compliant,\u201d he said. Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate.\n\nIn early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers.

(US intelligence agencies have said Russia\u2019s GRU is behind the site.) April 26: George Papadopoulos g e t s an intriguing tip . Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, sat down in London with a professor named Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud told him he\u2019d just traveled to Moscow and met high-level Russian government officials. He added to Papadopoulos that Russia had obtained \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nPapadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, sat down in London with a professor named Joseph Mifsud.

DCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties. That\u2019s because they included the hacked emails of retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, who had commanded NATO forces in Europe and pushed for a harder line against Russia in Ukraine. They also included documents from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.)\n\nDCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties.

They also included documents from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.) June 9: The Trump Tower meeting: Shortly afterward, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met a Russian lawyer and four other people with Russian ties at Trump Tower. Don Jr. had agreed to take the meeting based on the promise of \u201cofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,\u201d as part of \u201cRussia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d (as it was put to him in an email). Everyone involved claims nothing came of this meeting.\n\nThroughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures\u2019 emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change.\n\nThe email leaks begin\n\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. \u201cWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he announced, during a British television interview. \u201cWe have emails pending publication.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks \u2014 a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist \u2014 had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department \u2014 leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation\u2019s London embassy since June 2012.\n\nAssange\u2019s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked \u2014 by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike\u2019s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit.\n\nYet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder \u2014 because that is when \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of \u201cGucci\u201d and \u201cLucifer,\u201d is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who\u2019d broken into high-profile Americans\u2019 email accounts.)\n\nIn a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, \u201ca lone hacker.\u201d (\u201cFuck CrowdStrike!!!\u201d he wrote.) He said that he\u2019d given \u201cthe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails\u201d that he\u2019d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server.\n\nAlmost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer\u2019s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian \u2014 or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia\u2019s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account\u2019s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN \u2014 allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)\n\nYet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta\u2019s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun\u2019s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)\n\nOn July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker\u2019s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange\u2019s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill\u2019s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was \u201cgradually forget[ing] about me,\u201d and complained that WikiLeaks was \u201cplaying for time.\u201d)\n\nAll the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It\u2019s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but \u201cwe were given a little more time.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)\n\nFinally, on July 22 \u2014 the Friday before the convention \u2014 WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:\n\nThe DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer\u2019s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC\u2019s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. \u201cHoly fuck man I don\u2019t think you realize what you gave me,\u201d Nevins wrote in a DM. \u201cThis is probably worth millions of dollars.\u201d Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog.\n\nThen DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site\u2019s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell\u2019s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (\u201cgreedy\u201d) and Trump (\u201cnational disgrace\u201d).\n\nDCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders\u2019s young supporters were \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall\u2019s phished emails came next.\n\nMany of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAssange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had \u201cthousands of pages of material\u201d and was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying \u201can intermediary\u201d who\u2019d met with Assange said \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmother lode\u201d instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta\u2019s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news.\n\nIn the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cemails\u201d in the headlines throughout the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\n\nTrump associates tried to get in touch with hackers or leakers at least six separate times\n\nDuring the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin\u2019s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic.\n\nNo one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn\u2019t mere idle speculation, either \u2014 there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:\n\n1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed \u2014 on April 26 \u2014 that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming.\n\nAs described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he\u2019d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and, specifically, thousands of emails.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he\u2019d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)\n\nIn any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it.\n\n2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 \u2014 a little more than a month after Papadopoulos\u2019s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked \u2014 that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who\u2019d done business with the Trumps:\n\nThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.\n\nDon Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov.\n\nOnce the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he\u2019d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia.\n\nGoldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was \u201ceerily weird\u201d considering what they\u2019d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that.\n\n3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late.\n\nAnd last year, we learned that Cambridge\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails.\n\nNix says that in \u201cearly June,\u201d after he learned of Assange\u2019s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down.\n\nThen in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn\u2019t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\n4) Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group\u2019s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign.\n\nAs best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new \u201cPAC run anti-Trump site,\u201d PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. \u201cAny comments?\u201d the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nThen on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to \u201ccomment on\u201d or \u201cpush\u201d a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to \u201cjust drone\u201d Assange. Don Jr. answered, \u201cAlready did that earlier today. It\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d\n\nHe then followed up with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\u201d This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta\u2019s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr.\n\n5) Roger Stone\u2019s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump\u2019s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward.\n\nBoth in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks.\n\nOne associate of Stone\u2019s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he\u2019d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)\n\nThe initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg: \u201cI dined with Julian Assange last night,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn\u2019t in London then.)\n\nThe day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer\u2019s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn\u2019t responsible. He also tweeted that \u201cJulian Assange is a hero.\u201d\n\nThree days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. \u201cI actually have communicated with Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there\u2019s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u201d\n\nA few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive.\n\nOn August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.\u201d Many would later point to this \u2014 which came months before the Podesta emails became public \u2014 and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone\u2019s old friend Paul Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting \u201cPodesta\u2019s business dealings would be exposed.\u201d)\n\nAs October began, Stone took on a new role \u2014 as WikiLeaks\u2019 hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a \u201cfriend\u201d of his met with Assange and learned \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d He tweeted: \u201cWednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, \u201cLibs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.\u201d Assange published the Podesta emails two days later.\n\nImmediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group \u201chas never communicated with Roger Stone.\u201d The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were \u201cattacking\u201d him. \u201cThe false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,\u201d WikiLeaks responded. \u201cDon\u2019t go there if you don\u2019t want us to correct you.\u201d Stone shot back: \u201cHa! The more you \u2018correct\u2019 me the more people think you\u2019re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. However, he\u2019s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven\u2019t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge.\n\nIn any case, we might learn more from Mueller\u2019s probe soon enough. \u201cThey want me to testify against Roger,\u201d Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel\u2019s team. \u201cThey want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.\u201d\n\n6) Peter Smith\u2019s hunt for Hillary\u2019s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s a weird one.\n\nThis one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than work-related, and deleted them.\n\nConservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn\u2019t take Clinton\u2019s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That will be next.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton\u2019s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the \u201cdark web.\u201d So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader \u201cTrump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).\u201d It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven\u2019t commented.)\n\nEventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton\u2019s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. \u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn\u2019t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith \u2014 81 years old and in poor health \u2014 killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris.\n\nSmith\u2019s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn\u2019s role \u2014 particularly since, per Harris\u2019s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn\u2019s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does.\n\nMueller will likely bring charges in the email hacking matter. But against whom?\n\nLast November, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges.\n\nInterestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was \u201crelatively technical\u201d and had already \u201cbeen under way for nearly a year.\u201d\n\nThat appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added \u201ca veteran cyber prosecutor,\u201d Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)\n\nSo it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he\u2019ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this is all just what we know about \u2014 there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it\u2019s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence.\n\nMueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith\u2019s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort\u2019s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?\n\nAll three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven\u2019t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re telling Mueller a good deal that\u2019s of interest \u2014 and eventually, we will find out what.", "comment_3": "BREAKING: Breitbart Leaks Names Of 4 Dems Being Charged In Mueller\u2019s Russia Probe https://t.co/xrnJe3BcQf", "split": "train"}

The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.\n\nAnd while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America\u2019s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary\u2019s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.\n\nAnd a public revelation of that magnitude \u2014 publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary\u2019s sensitive and top secret emails \u2014 would have derailed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn\u2019t simply because it was concealed.\n\nFBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton\u2019s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.\n\nAnd did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary\u2019s emails? The FBI didn\u2019t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.\n\nHundreds of top secret documents and even the president\u2019s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server \u2014 and intercepted by a communist country \u2014 yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton\u2019s and her inner circle\u2019s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.\n\nEven the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI \u2014 specifically Strzok \u2014 about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.\n\nThat same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.\n\nWe could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.\n\nIs anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?", "comment_3": "Lisa Page Squeals: DNC Server Was Not Hacked By Russia https://t.co/0KyqhZYB1D via @yournewswire  Awesome !

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has \u201censhrined sodomy into the United States Constitution\u201d and cities like Houston are trying to \u201cforce women to go into men\u2019s bathrooms and men to go into women\u2019s bathrooms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,\u201d he lamented, warning that \u201cthe wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.\u201d He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it\u2019s a great country, I\u2019d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we\u2019re going to have this financial collapse. We\u2019re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that\u2019s probably the way he\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: \u201cI believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I\u2019m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,\u201d Robertson opined.\n\n\n\nThe viewer then interrupted \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d host to state that \u201cthat sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,\u201d referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Robertson quickly became defensive. \u201cI am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?\u201d the host asked the caller.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d the caller replied. \u201cBut I also understand that you\u2019re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n", "comment_3": "\u201cNone of this is normal\u201d: read the full transcript of Sen.

Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has \u201csanctioned\u201d violence, as long it protects the \u201cpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.\u201d She insisted that the president is sending \u201ca signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don\u2019t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.\u201d She also linked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving \u201cnormal\u201d people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n\u201cAnd these days it has become so obvious that I\u2019m honestly surprised we\u2019re not having riots throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didn\u2019t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I\u2019m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\u201d\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that \u201cnot even slaves\u201d suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I\u2019m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to be all evolved right now, we\u2019re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He\u2019s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you\u2019ve seen in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Bachmann continued firing, \u201cI don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d She added, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I\u2019d be saying the same thing all over again,\u201d Bachmann quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out \u2013 white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I\u2019m seriously worried whether or not we\u2019ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we\u2019re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we\u2019ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another \u2013 white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that\u2019s just one step away from extinction,\u201d Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "comment_3": "@HillaryClinton Bachmann: \u201cWhite People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery\u201d", "split": "train"}

You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.\n\nHere is who has declined so far:\n\nElton John\n\nThis rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be \"the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\"\n\nThat sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: \"Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\"\n\nJohn added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: \"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.\n\n\"I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\"\n\nAndrea Bocelli\n\nIn early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.\n\nIce T\n\nAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.\n\nBut Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\"\n\nCeline Dion\n\nAccording to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.\n\nDion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.\n\nJohn Legend\n\nJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\n\n\"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\"\n\nAdam Lambert\n\nAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\n\n\"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said.\n\n\"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"", "comment_3": "Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John Legend\nhttps://t.co/He9k2JNr0d", "split": "train"}

Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.\n\n\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\n\nThe Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.\n\nBut FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.\n\nThen-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderThe old 'state rights' and the new state power The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Harris brings her A game to Miami debate Holder rips Walker over Wisconsin gerrymandering MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.\n\nSpokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn\u2019t comment.\n\nMikerin was a director of Rosatom\u2019s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom\u2019s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom\u2019s new American arm called Tenam.\n\nBetween 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin \u201cdid knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,\u201d a November 2014 indictment stated.\n\nHis illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin\u2019s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.\n\nIn evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a \u201cracketeering scheme\u201d that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.\n\n\u201cAs part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,\u201d Agent David Gadren testified.\n\n\u201cMikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,\u201d the agent added.\n\nThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham open to investigating Acosta-Epstein plea deal Sustaining progress with Mexico on migration Government to issue licenses for business with Huawei MORE\u2019s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.\n\nBoth men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife\u2019s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.\n\nThe connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.\n\nIts many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.\n\nThe case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia\u2019s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.\n\nOne of Mikerin\u2019s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to \u201callow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,\u201d agents testified in one court filing.\n\nBringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency\u2019s cap.\n\nBut the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.\n\nThe only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.\n\nBy that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\u2019s approval.\n\nThe final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia\u2019s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThe lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, \u201ca former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison\u201d and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.\n\nRonald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin\u2019s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.\n\n\u201cI had no idea this case was being conducted,\u201d a surprised Hosko said in an interview.\n\nLikewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.\n\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration\u2019s approval of the Uranium One deal.\n\n\u201cNot providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated at 6:50 p.m.\n\nIndictment Affidavit by M Mali on Scribd\n\nWarrant Affidavit by M Mali on Scribd\n\nMikerin Plea Deal by M Mali on Scribd", "comment_3": "@blove65 @im2byteme @BillPeriman @eavesdropann \n\nObama released 10 Russian agents from US custody in 2010 during Hi\u2026 https://t.co/7pmLlsWNg0", "split": "train"}

Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a \u201cmini Baghdad,\u201d but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another \u201caccomplishment\u201d on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the \u201clargest scam in United States history.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe corrupt establishment will do anything to suppress sites like the Burning Platform from revealing the truth.

[Jim Quinn - PO Box 1520 Kulpsville, PA 19443] or Paypal\n\nMuslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation\u2019s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation\u2019s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the \u201clargest scam\u201d that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.\n\nThe scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:\n\n\u201cOfficials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.\n\nFederal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.\n\nOne of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.\n\nFederal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam\u2019s value.\n\n\u2018Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,\u2019 Sessions said.\n\nA physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.\u201d\n\nThe ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers\u2019 noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here\u2019s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet\u2026all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.\n\nOther nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid\u2019s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.\n\nMore than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include:\n\nMashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County \u2013 controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness;\n\nYasser Mozeb, of Oakland County \u2013 allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness;\n\nAbdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians;\n\nJoseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical;\n\nTariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.\n\nMohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department isn\u2019t messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid\u2019s companies\u2019 fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.\n\nWe must continue to sound the alarm about what\u2019s going right underneath our noses. This isn\u2019t the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!", "comment_3": "The Largest Bust in U.S. History\u2019 Sharia Swamp 412 Muslims Arrested from Michigan, across country. #Antifa #DemExit https://t.co/7VdeKH6Y7f", "split": "train"}

The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.\n\nThe high-level police source within the Sheriff\u2019s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nDuring the IG\u2019s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI\u2019s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cWe constantly promote \u2018see something, say something,\u2019 and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u2018See something, say something\u2019 is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,\u201d Governor Scott said.\n\nAccording to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel\u2019s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn\u2019t the sole reason why he is being removed.\n\nThe high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.\n\nSheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine\u2019s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel\u2019s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.\n\nIt is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.\n\nSince the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.\n\nIn May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel\u2019s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.\n\nShortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.\n\nMost recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff\u2019s car that read, \u201cOur new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?\u201d\n\nThe tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff\u2019s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.\n\nDuring the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cI would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\n\u201cSheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,\u201d Putnam said.\n\nGovernor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel\u2019s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.\n\nIn the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, \u201cthe only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.\u201d However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.", "comment_3": "Broward County Sheriff Fired For Lying About Parkland https://t.co/K2PkD4fEYx via @yournewswire", "split": "train"}

The remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin\u2019s New York apartment. Hillary Clinton is silent on the topic as Huma\u2019s neighbors told the cops they believe the police investigation has something to do with Anthony Weiner\u2019s recent conviction.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a New York apartment block where Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin own a home. The 48-year-old, who police say lived at the premises, was found unconscious inside the machine and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her cause of death has yet to be announced by the medical examiner.\n\nPolice had been called to the block at 1 Irving Place in Union Square just before 5pm. The deceased woman, whose identity has been withheld until police notify her family, was found by a building maintenance worker.\n\nPolice do not yet know how she ended up in the trash compactor, but neighbors at the luxury apartment block told NBC they believed the police presence was related to Weiner\u2019s recent conviction for sexting an underage girl:\n\nPolice say a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a luxury residential building in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square. Crime scene investigators were on the scene at 1 Irving Place Tuesday evening, collecting evidence in the bizarre and grisly death. Police say it\u2019s not clear yet how the 48-year-old woman died, but her body was found at around 5 p.m. Her purse was found near the trash chute where it appears she went in. Neighbors said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building\u2019s famous resident, Anthony Weiner. The disgraced former congressman is still listed as a resident at the building, though he\u2019s currently serving time in prison for sexting an underage girl.\n\nSecurity footage also shows the woman walking into the apartment building shortly before she was found inside the machine, PIX11 reported:\n\nA woman\u2019s body was found inside of a trash compactor near Union Square on Tuesday, police said. Officers found the body at the Zeckendorf Towers on Irving Place just before 5 p.m., officials said. The woman, identified only as being 48 years old, was unconscious and unresponsive when police arrived on scene. Security camera shows the woman entering the building shortly before her body was found in the trash compactor, sources said. Property belonging to the woman, who entered the compactor area on the 27th floor, was found inside the compact room, police sources said. Police have not yet released her name. The circumstances around her death are not yet clear.\n\nAccording to Daily Mail, Weiner and Abedin have owned an apartment at the address for 16 years, which was listed for rent at $11,900 a month on the same day he pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl. Abedin also filed for divorce that same day. The listing, posted on May 19, 2017, was taken down just days later, though it is unclear as to whether the estranged couple found a renter, or if the property was taken off the market for other reasons.\n\nTheir modern apartment, located on the 14th and 15th floors, has a view that overlooks Union Square Park and extends out over the midtown skyline. There are 670 units in the apartment block, divided into four blocks: Gramercy, Village, Park, and University. There is a communal pool, gym, and grassy rooftop for residents to enjoy.\n\nThe former congressman, who is currently in prison, is eligible to begin his three years supervised release in August 2019.\n\nIt certainly will be interesting to see what they come up with in order to explain away what appears to be a murder at the apartment building where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner own a home. Will they call it a robbery, like in the case of Seth Rich? Perhaps the better question is this: What did this woman know about Hillary Clinton?", "comment_3": "Hillary In Hiding As Police Discover Dead Body Hidden In Huma Abedin\u2019s Dumpster: https://t.co/a068QTLjmc via @YouTube", "split": "train"}

We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States\u2026\n\nTHE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:\n\n\u2018DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!\u2019 The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York\u2019s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.\n\nHe has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.\n\nWhile executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about \u2018attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said further that he would \u2018continue to create chaos\u2019 for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.\n\nIT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It\u2019s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.\n\nAlthough he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world\u2019s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.\n\nHe has told people in the communications industry that he is \u2018very interested in communications,\u2019 which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.\n\nThe Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him \u2018a real-estate genius\u2019 who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970\u2019s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.\n\nMany urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. \u2018With manufacturing leaving,\u2019 says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, \u2018and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.\u2019\n\nThe rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.\n\nThat Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump\u2019s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.\n\n\u2018He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,\u2019 a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.\n\nThe day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.\n\nFor a billion-dollar corporation, there aren\u2019t too many people around.\n\nDonald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.\n\nSays Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: \u2018If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.\u2019 Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.\n\n\u2018He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,\u2019 says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. \u2018I don\u2019t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,\u2019 he says, \u2018but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: \u2018Tell us what you want, you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u2019\n\n\u2018Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,\u2019 says a developer\u2026 He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.\u2019\n\nRoy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s friend and attorney, adds: \u2018He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.\u2019\n\nSuch was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970\u2019s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son\u2019s efforts to buy the hotel as \u2018fighting for a seat on the Titanic.\u2019 But, Donald Trump says, \u2018I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, \u2018How bad can this be?\u201d He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.\n\nHe had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. \u2018If the seller was Italian,\u2019 says Mr. Trump, \u2018we sent an Italian\u2019 \u2013 something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in his genes,\u2019 says Fred Trump, explaining his son\u2019s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.\n\n\u2018Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,\u2019 says Mr. Fischer. \u2018We\u2019ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.\u2019\n\nHis success also derives from his marketing skills. \u2018I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,\u2019 Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers \u2013 including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses \u2013 go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.\n\nSome developers find Mr. Trump\u2019s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.\n\nPreston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city\u2019s convention center, concludes: \u2018He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.\u2019\n\nThe condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another \u2018super luxury\u2019 building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? \u2018You sell them a fantasy,\u2019 Mr. Trump explains. \u2018He deserves full credit for his success,\u2019 says another builder. \u2018He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: \u2018Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?\u201d\n\n\u2018What sets Trump apart,\u2019 says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, \u2018is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.\u2019\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t use the term \u2018settlement\u2019 with Donald.\u2019\n\nMr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.\n\nHe speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.\n\nHe talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.\n\nHis father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn\u2019t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.\n\nMr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.\n\nHis friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to \u201921\u2019 for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn\u2019t quite realize that he\u2019s one of them.\n\nAfter dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.\n\nAsked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?\n\nHe says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.\n\nHis greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements \u2013 he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.\n\nThe idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.\n\nHe is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.\n\nHe dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.\n\nAREN\u2019T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!\n\nsource:https://100percentfedup.com", "comment_3": "Life before the media was deregulated and liberals lost their minds...\n\nTHIS IS AMAZING: In 1984, the New York Time\u2026 https://t.co/UbIRD0VBqD", "split": "train"}

To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,\u201d said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.\n\nSims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.\n\nThe sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.\n\nBut it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures \u2014 such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week \u2014 and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.\n\nOver the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year \u2014 and every year after 2013 \u2014 is continuing.", "comment_3": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month https://t.co/aaSZvwyF9c https://t.co/q7pGYTAo0K", "split": "train"}

Now the state of California has appointed its first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.\n\nThe committee\u2019s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful \u2014 the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or \u201cCal-SOAP,\u201d for short \u2014 but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college\n\nMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.\n\nMateo said via Fox News \u2013 \u201cWhile undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\u201d\n\nTrending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! \u2018That Is Not Acceptable Here \u2013 I Won\u2019t Allow It!\u2019\n\nSenate Bill 174 made Mateo\u2019s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill\u2019s author said in a statement. \u201cUndocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can\u2019t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo\u2019s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.\n\nMateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting \u2013 In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value.

In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish \u2013\n\n\u201cEverything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.\u201d\n\nIf she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.\n\nIt is important to note that while Mateo is the first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.\n\nMany were also quick to point out Mateo\u2019s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions \u2013 \u201cAs someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.\u201d\n\nIn #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.\n\nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\n\nShe never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.\n\nThe thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.\n\nThe label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.\n\nSadly, in the case of the mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.\n\nWe must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.", "comment_3": "Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies.

Trump\u2019s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump\u2019s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that \u201cPresident\u201d Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump \ufffd?s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trump\u2019s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump\u2019s support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.\n\nPlease share this story on Facebook!", "comment_3": "BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It https://t.co/ciEZJzk51j", "split": "train"}

Especially since the porn star Stormy Daniel is obviously trying to take attention off Donald and Melania\u2019s strong marriage by placing it on her herself along with her sick affair asserts she has since recanted, but nevertheless won\u2019t quit speaking about.\n\nDaniels is making Melania look bad and the first woman is getting revenge by never giving into her attention-seeking ways with any reaction or attack, which the pornography celebrity probably wants considering she\u2019s probably doing all of this for monetary gain and a wonderful book deal.\n\nAfter all, it has to be hard being a washed-up porn star that will never be as well respected, well known, well liked and rich since Melania is.\n\nMelania is keeping her class and elegance before the world in a very rough time. While at precisely the same time also showing she\u2019s human and relatable by recognizing lifestyle is \u201cnot so simple.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fact and leaves her relatable to us ordinary folk, it is not weakness, so it may very well be her greatest strength and the reason a lot people adore and respect her. Not sure you\u2019ll be able to find 1 person who admires and would like to become Stormy Daniels.\n\nStormy, go crawl back into the cave you came out, no one here is interested in the accusations you are making which allegedly happened over a decade ago.\n\nVia CBS News:\n\n\u201cIt had been over a decade back from 2006 that, according to a Wall Street Journal expose published last week, porn celebrity Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, stated she\u2019d slept with billionaire \u201cApprentice\u201d host Donald Trump.\n\nBut outlets were chasing the story seemingly long before that.\n\nInTouch magazine Wednesday released a seven-year-old interview with Clifford, in which she states she\u2019d recurring sexual experiences with Mr. Trump after meeting him in July 2006.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a lover of his or not, which I never really was, you gotta admit he is pretty fascinating,\u201d Clifford said in the 2011 interview that the magazine published Wednesday. \u201cWe had really great banter. He told me that I was a person to be reckoned with, smart and beautiful just like his daughter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear with the publication didn\u2019t operate with the interview at the time.\n\nJacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of Slate, wrote an article in his book before this week also saying he spoke with Clifford about the alleged tryst at the moment, and between August and October 2016, before the election, the porn star was prepared to take her story people.\n\nAn old acquaintance of his in California was near a girl from the adult-film business who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump. I reached my friend\u2019s buddy, who placed me in touch with the celebrity, who\u2019s called Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels\u2026did really have a narrative about Trump, which she related to me in a series of phone conversations and text exchanges that took place between August and October of 2016.\u201d\n\nThree of Clifford\u2019s friends told Weisberg that they were conscious of the alleged affair at that time. Weisberg also published the screenshot of an unsigned document Clifford allegedly sent to him 2016.\n\nClifford was worried Mr. Trump would not cover, and she wished to be reimbursed somehow if she talked out instead, Weisberg wrote. Then, Weisberg said she stopped responding to his efforts at communication. He never published anything regarding the claims before the election.\n\n\u201cGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t believe an extramarital affair could be a highly significant story,\u201d Weisberg wrote.\n\nMore specifically, she said her attorney Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based lawyer who specializes in claims against celebrities, had exercised the conditions with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\nSlate wasn\u2019t the only book pursuing the story.\n\nA Fox News reporter, according to a CNN report, was also pursuing the story about the alleged event. Fox News writer Diana Falzone in October 2016 allegedly filed a story that included an on-the-record announcement from Clifford\u2019s supervisor at the time confirming the alleged event, also Falzone had viewed emails talking a settlement. However, Fox News shelved the narrative, according to the CNN report.\n\nClifford a week denied the affair asserts in a statement provided to CBS News.\n\n\u201cTo whom it may concern, I recently became aware that certain news outlets have been alleging that I had a sexual or romantic affair with Donald Trump guy, many, many years ago. I am stating with complete consent that this is totally false.\u201d\n\nThe buzz about \u201cStormy Daniels\u201d \u2014 she was trending on Twitter Friday \u2014 has seemingly died down as fast as it came. In the very first White House press briefing since the Wall Street Journal report, not one reporter asked about the narrative.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image Source H/T: ConservativePost\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "comment_3": "BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump https://t.co/cjFztmT9gU", "split": "train"}

What Israeli military leaders really worry about \u2014 but cannot talk about \u2014 is losing their nuclear monopoly.\n\nAn Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.\n\nIf Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.\n\nIt is, Clinton continues, the \u201cstrategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria\u201d that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel\u2019s security.\n\nThis would not come about through a \u201cdirect attack,\u201d Clinton admits, because \u201cin the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel\u201d this has never occurred, but through its alleged \u201cproxies.\u201d\n\nThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel\u2019s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.\n\nBringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel\u2019s security, it would also ease Israel\u2019s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.\n\nThen, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.\n\nClinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad \u201cand his family\u201d with violence is the \u201cright thing\u201d to do:\n\nIn short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.\n\nWith his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s mind.\n\nThe email proves\u2014as if any more proof was needed\u2014that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to \u201cprotect\u201d Israel.\n\nIt is also a sobering thought to consider that the \u201crefugee\u201d crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.\n\nIn addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq\u2014all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the \u201crebels\u201d and stoking the fires of war in Syria.\n\nThe real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton\u2014whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people\u2014could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.\n\nClinton\u2019s public assertion that, if elected president, she would \u201ctake the relationship with Israel to the next level,\u201d would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.", "comment_3": "Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel https://t.co/7XIEGb3X3P via @yournewswire", "split": "train"}

Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded.", "comment_3": "Sarah Palin Calls to Boycott Mall of America Because 'Santa Was Always White in the Bible' https://t.co/c62dfBVHnF Sarah is just nuts...", "split": "train"}

Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, a Democrat-alligned Puerto Rico mayor, is facing fraud charges relating to the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds, just months after Puerto Rican politicians appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.\n\nUpdate: This article, published on July 15 2018, originally alleged that San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz was the Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds. This was incorrect.\n\nAccording to a DOJ press release from July 5 of this year, it was the mayor of the municipality of Sabana Grande, Miguel G. Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, who had \u201cbeen indicted and arrested for his participation in a conspiracy to steal federal funds involving fraudulently obtained contracts from the PR Department of Education.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and huge amounts of money to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still openly criticized the president \u2014 and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the \u201cblame Trump\u201d narrative.\n\nAs comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWhat is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,\u201d Yul\u00edn Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled \u201cNASTY\u201d \u2014 where did she get it during a major storm? \u2014 as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.\n\nLiberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. \u201cWe are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,\u201d she said during a television conference in early October.\n\nWestern Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of \u201cinefficiency and bureaucracy\u201d in Puerto Rico \u2026 but it looks like the island\u2019s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.\n\nAlthough the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.\n\n\u201cThe suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,\u201d the AP reported.\n\n\u201cU.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town\u2019s public employees and municipal contractors,\u201d the newswire continued.\n\n\u201cNot only is that illegal, it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Rodriguez added.\n\nPuerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.\n\nAt the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz V\u00e9lez, who served as mayor. Ortiz V\u00e9lez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.\n\nGuess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?\n\nThere may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.\n\n\u201cRodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,\u201d the AP confirmed.\n\nThe hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn\u2019t point to Donald Trump \u2026 it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.", "comment_3": "Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over $3M In Federal Disaster Relief https://t.co/HBorXNezgQ", "split": "train"}

Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. \u201cIf you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a fact.\u201d\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president\u2019s power, or in other words, its limitations \u2013 if they exist \u2013 Spicer argued that the Constitution \u201cclearly states\u201d what the President of the United States can and cannot do. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cone must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn\u2019t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president\u2019s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn\u2019t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.\u201d\n\nSpicer continued, \u201cAs a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there\u2019s a real need to follow the aforementioned \u2018if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president\u2019 rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that\u2019s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Spicer concluded.", "comment_3": "Spicer: \u201cTrump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure\u201d https://t.co/FzC06gKx3e", "split": "train"}

For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a \u201cgunshot to the head\u201d that\u2019s been ruled a \u201csuicide\u201d by the Miami-Dade\u2019s medical examiner records supervisor.\n\nKlaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.\n\nEberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.\n\nEberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government\u2019s economic development agency, Fonds d\u2019assistance \u00e9conomique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations.

Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton\u2019s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton\u2019s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.\n\nSansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to \u201cside\u201d with the Clinton Administration and he would \u201cbe the richest man in Haiti.\u201d\n\nHe also demanded that Hillary Clinton \u201cdisclose the audit of all money\u201d related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cNot even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you.

All have turned into a Trump-trashing session for pissed of celebrities to get far too much off their chest about our unapologetic leader.\n\nHowever, not everyone in Hollywood shares the same opinion as the most outspoken offender, Meryl Streep, as Kurt Russell just showed her and all of Trump\u2019s other famous foes that it\u2019s time to shut up about our president.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard much from Russell lately, it\u2019s because he falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn\u2019t crying over Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss and doesn\u2019t feel that he needs to make his political opinions known. He\u2019s simply doing what he\u2019s paid well to do and wishes others in the biz would too. Since they continue to throw tantrums and trash Trump on a public stage, Russell reached his breaking point and finally fired back hard.\n\n\u201cThis is a business that\u2019s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent,\u201d Russell began in his blistering beratement of these overpaid crybabies after what Streep said at the Golden Globes. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge them that. I\u2019m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways,\u201d he added, as reported by the American Lookout. \u201cBut yeah, we think differently, and maybe that\u2019s cut me out of some things. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said before dropping a brutal announcement on these Streep and her lemmings that left them burning.\n\nExplaining that they\u2019re not empowered in this business by their disgraceful attitudes against our leaders, the badass actor said they better be prepared to put their money where their nasty mouths are since they could be out of work. \u201cPeople know I get along great with all kinds of directors, all kinds of actors.

It\u2019s just, it\u2019s all about the work.

America is a land of laws and those wishing to immigrate to the country must follow the proper laws and protocol because people cannot simply walk in without following the rules. Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally.\n\nOut of those 1,600 it\u2019s unknown how many people have criminal records, but they were all about to have a criminal record if they broke into a country illegally. The National Guard helped protect the border and provided the extra manpower that was needed to keep the situation under control. It was reported that the level of criminal activity has slowed due to the agents being present.\n\nThe Washington Examiner provided this information about the border situation: \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border, CBP and defense officials said Wednesday.\n\nNational Guard officials overseeing the border state deployments said troops helping monitor the international boundary have freed up more border agents to physically guard the border. The result has led to a surge in the amount of criminal activity agents have stopped.\n\nTrending: BUSTED!! Hillary\u2019s Strange Scarf Accidentally Slips Off In Public Exposes What She\u2019s Been Hiding For Months!\n\nThe increased surveillance and communication between guardsmen and border officers also led to CBP intercepting an additional 451 people who were turned back before illegally entering the U.S.\n\nThose numbers could tick up considerably if the 4,000 National Guard troops President Trump approved on April 4 are called on in a future request from CBP.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 775 troops have been deployed and are on the ground providing \u201cdirect support on the ground\u201d in seven sectors assisting law enforcement officers.\n\nTroops are providing support from the air, surveillance back-up, and assistance with infrastructure projects like vegetation clearing and road maintenance, not including to the border wall construction. Another task is to specifically free up agents to leave their desks and get back out to the field. The troops monitoring remote video surveillance systems have then been able to report sightings to a greater field of agents and thus, the number of apprehensions has increased, officials said.\n\n\u201cThose folks are giving us the additional situational awareness in the radio rooms \u2026 which are allowing the Border Patrol agents sitting in those areas to go into the field,\u201d said one National Guard official, who described the addition of the Guard as a \u201cforce-multiplier\u201d for the CBP.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, these guardsmen are not carrying out law enforcement duties,\u201d an official representing the Texas National Guard said.\n\nGuardsmen have been deployed to the following Border Patrol sectors: 200 to the Rio Grande Valley, 120 to Laredo, 90 to Del Rio, 70 to Big Bend, 110 to El Paso, 135 to Tuscon, and 50 to Yuma.\n\nIn late April, the California National Guard said 200 guardsmen were in training at Camp Roberts and would be deployed in early May. Around 55 troops are already working in those sectors.\n\nThe deployment is funded through the end of fiscal year 2018, September 30. Ronald Vitiello, CBP deputy commissioner, said in April the intent of the mission is for CBP to regain operational control of the border.\u201d\n\nWith the deployment being funded through to the end of the fiscal year of 2018, that means the law should likely be upheld for quite a while until it\u2019s time to renew the budget or the illegal swarm backs off and follows the law.\n\nSome critics are upset that America won\u2019t simply allow people to break into the country, but borders exist for reasons and permit the land to adhere to their laws. Some people want borderless countries, but that would result in absolute chaos much like what\u2019s happening to Germany, Sweden, and London where they have been ravaged by refugees.\n\nWill you comment below and share this to your friends? Will you start a conversation about borders and the proper protocol that it takes to enter a country the legal way.\n\nSource:Viralwdc", "comment_3": "National Guard Storms Mexico Border, Makes Game-Changing Impact In Just 30 Days https://t.co/rH5QvCCRYE", "split": "train"}

Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he\u2019s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump\u2019s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nReports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI\u2019s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok \u201cintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.\u201d\n\nThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with \u201cspecific investigative decisions,\u201d but said that comment and others \u201cimplies a willingness to take official action.\u201d\n\nStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn\u2019t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump\u2019s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that \u201cI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.\n\nGoelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent \u201cintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that\u2019s a topic, and his own integrity.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general\u2019s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump\u2019s allies from calling for Mueller\u2019s immediate suspension.\n\nWhy was the FBI\u2019s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nStrzok still works for the FBI, but it\u2019s unclear what he does now.

You\u2019re doing propaganda,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cThey threw us under the bus at every opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnother former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the \u201cappearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything,\u201d and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook.\n\nLaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: \u201cThat felt really gross \u2026 Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission.\u201d\n\nAside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to \"Save Snopes\" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal.\n\nOf course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan?\n\nAccording to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company.\n\nMikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on \"himself and prostitutes.\"\n\nDuring the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the \"industry standard\" or at least $360,000 a year.\n\nBeing motivated by \"facts\" is apparently very lucrative.\n\nAnd in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts.\n\nTherefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's \"false,\" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the \"fact-check,\" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes.\n\nDue to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.\n\n\u00a9 press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money\n\nOver recent months this push to flag big news stories as \"false,\" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent.\n\nIn November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to \"wash away\" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams.\n\nAccording to Breitbart, the move was an \"openly partisan\" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral.\n\nEarlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it \"botched\" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information.\n\nSnopes said that the \u201cgeneral idea\u201d of the meme was \u201ccorrect,\u201d yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the \"wildly misleading\" meme was true.\n\nIn Snopes \"transparency\" disclaimer, it states that it operates \"without any partisan considerations,\" saying:\n\n\"We don\u2019t choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican/Democratic, conservative/liberal, or religious/secular issues.\"\n\nDespite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear.\n\nSnopes' \"science dude\" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts.\n\nThe only way to report on that \"totally clears the president\" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as \"breaking news\" \u2014 Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a \"science writer\" who mainly \"debunks\" science-related articles.\n\nIt comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as \"right-wing blog\" and \"junk news.\"\n\nBiting the hand that feeds\n\nSnopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda.\n\nVisits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization.\n\nAccording to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month.\n\nThis number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months.\n\nWhile it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as \"fake news\" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral \"fact-checks,\" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.\n\n\u00a9 SimilarWeb Website visits to Snopes have plummeted by almost 50 percent since July\n\nThe appearance of trying to prevent damage\n\n\u201cWhy should we trust Facebook when it\u2019s pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news?\u201d an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[\u2026] Working with Facebook makes us look bad.\u201d\n\nAccording to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly \u201clong worked\u201d with Facebook even referred to the social network as a \u201cterrible company,\u201d declaring, \u201cand, on a personal level, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them,\u201d while another fact-checker proclaimed, \u201cMost of us feel it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nFacebook started its fact-checking efforts following President Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos.\n\nLeft-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.\n\nAn investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as \u201cprogressive\u201d and expressing anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nA satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to \u201cspin the news,\u201d was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false.\n\nOne of Facebook\u2019s other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election \u2014 rating 51 percent of Clinton\u2019s claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump.\n\nEven a 2013 article from one of Facebook\u2019s other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact \u201chas it out for Republicans,\u201d and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook.\n\nUPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't \"fact-check\" or \"debunk\" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims.

In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.\n\nIn part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would \u201cbring back\u201d the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nskip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\n>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysis\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 1\n\nNo one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as \u201c birth of our savior \u201c.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion \u2014 Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 2\n\n@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on seasonal \u201cgenerosity.\u201d She related the story of St. Matthew\u2019s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can\u2019t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders\u2019 story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such \u201cstories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that\u2019s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.\n\nskip - Ivanka Trump tweet\n\nAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on \u201cthis sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.\u201d\n\nskip - Ivanka's defiance\n\nTRUMP\u2019s DAUGHTER IS AGAINST CHRISTMAS!!!

She dared do this in a tweet that included a photo of her posing in front of Christmas trees. \u2014 Joan Strong (@TruthInJeopardy) December 23, 2017\n\nShapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had \u201cworked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.\u201d He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nskip - Eric Trump tweet\n\nBut as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn\u2019t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.\n\nTrue, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it \u2013 though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nIndeed, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the \u201creturn to Merry Christmas\u201d message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.\n\nShe seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d with no mention of the \u201cC-word,\u201d in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father\u2019s \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d rhetoric.\n\nFor those who would chalk up Ivanka\u2019s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.\n\nEven Melania Trump\u2019s much publicized \u2013 and much maligned \u2013 choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a cr\u00e8che display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.\n\nAll of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump\u2019s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and pro-\u201cHappy Holidays\u201d conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn\u2019t at all reflective of mainstream America.\n\nThat feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than they had in the past.\n\nThe Pew poll reported: \u201cA rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d\n\nskip - Politicization of Christmas\n\nI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. \u2014 Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.\n\nskip - Feraz Ozel tweet\n\n\u2018My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas\u2019 \u2014 Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the \u2018War on Christmas\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017\n\nThis year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business\u2019 choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third \u2013 32 percent \u2013 said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d during the holidays.\n\nOverall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump\u2019s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe that the \u201cbiblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events\u201d is \u201cshrinking,\u201d it said, and \u201ca declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d obsession shores up his status with evangelicals \u2013 even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don\u2019t care much how it\u2019s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.\n\nIn a blow to the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d theory from one of Trump\u2019s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 if the time is right,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cJust because some people say \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to people who don\u2019t celebrate it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.\u201d", "comment_3": "WAR ON CHRISTMAS: OBAMA ORDERS BAN ON CHRISTMAS CARDS TO MILITARY https://t.co/Ect10a8yxI", "split": "train"}

Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\n\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s approach in the 1930\u2019s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

That is a -29 percent collapse.\n\nCNN\u2019s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.\n\nIn other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.\n\nFox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN\u2019s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN\u2019s 635K.\n\nWhile MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.\n\nIncredibly, CNN\u2019s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K.

In a recent document, it certainly sounds like representatives of the United States promised \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the UN\u2019s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe UN conference \u201cprovided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,\u201d according to politifact.\n\nPolitifact also claimed, \u201cCaroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.\u201d Adding,\n\n\u201c\u2018The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,\u2019 Dorminey wrote in an email. \u2018The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion \u2014 especially across borders \u2014 that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.'\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade \u2014 not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.'\u201d\n\nHowever, the wording here is suspicious.\n\nThe Third Review Conference for the UN\u2019s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American \u2018representatives\u2019 at the conference agreed to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce \u201cproper management\u201d of \u201csmall arms and light weapons\u201d stockpiles.\n\nIt appears that the agreement could also include \u2018stockpiles\u2019 owned by American citizens.\n\nAccording to some, the United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name. Many think they are hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.\n\nThe conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.\n\nThis will serve as a means for the United Nations to find \u2018illicit\u2019 ammunition and firearms.\n\nIf the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN\u2019s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.\n\nHowever, it gets worse still. The \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 also allows UN \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 to go to member nations to \u2018assist\u2019 in meeting the goals of the program.\n\nSo, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to \u2018help\u2019 speed the process up.\n\nThe conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.\n\nFirstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).\n\nSecondly, they agreed to strengthen \u2018coordinated approaches\u2019 nationally for implementing the PoA.\n\nThirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.\n\nFourth, the representatives agreed to create a \u2018national point of contact\u2019 to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.\n\nFifth, they promised to \u2018make better use\u2019 of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be \u2018in compliance\u2019 with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and \u2018non-proliferation,\u2019 which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.\n\nFinally, they agreed to \u2018significantly reduce\u2019 illicit flows of small arms through means such as \u2018voluntary surrender\u2019 programmes and \u2018illicit weapons\u2019 recovery.\n\nIn other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.\n\nIf they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.\n\nThis agreement seems wildly unconstitutional, but UN officials don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nBy requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it seems to violate the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are \u201creserved to the states respectively.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a \u2018liaison\u2019 between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.\n\nPerhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the \u2018illicit firearms trade.\u2019", "comment_3": "US Representatives Promise Implement Of UN Gun-Control Plans https://t.co/WF5lxvsN4S via @ConDailyPost", "split": "train"}

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. \u201cWe thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there\u2019s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting\u201d, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. \u201cThey are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal\u201d, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. \u201cHopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern\u201d, said Dr. Polowotski. \u201cBoaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution\u201d. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. \u201cWe were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it\u201d, said Bob. \u201cWe were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow.

Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.\n\nOn the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook \u2014 an American corporation \u2014 being banned in the country.\n\nUnfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. \"Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,\" said Trump.\n\nGovernance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.\n\nOther social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.\n\nThe people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.\n\nRick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's \"commitment\" should have not just been limited to Facebook. \"You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head.\n\nIn California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.\n\nCourts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.\n\nKeen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.\n\nReacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.\n\nOn Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.\n\nLast month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.\n\nLately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.\n\nEmployees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.\n\nDonald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

Hodges says he has no regrets.\n\nIn amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.\n\nHodges says he has no regrets.\n\nHe claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.\n\nHodges had worked for the CIA.\n\nHodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.\n\nHe was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.\n\nDespite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James \u201cJimmy\u201d Hayworth.\n\nHe also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the \u201cthe CIA had its own agenda\u201d. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists \u2013 all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.\n\nHodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant \u201cthreat to the security of the country\u201d and had to be eliminated.\n\n\u201cWe had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro\u201d, says M. Hodges. \u201cMy commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders\u2026 I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn\u2019t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!\u201d\n\nMarilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal \u2013 a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.\n\nThe FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.\n\nThe most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.\n\nThis could open up many questions about the CIA\u2019s activities in America in that era. What do you think?

The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.\n\nThe 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda \u2014 unless, of course, it\u2019s funny. \u201cYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn\u2019t do on TV,\u201d Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix\u2019s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: \"We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.\"\n\nThe announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (\"I want equal pay! And a chardonnay\") to dating and other social issues.\n\nThough Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.\n\nBy jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central \u2014 and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network\u2019s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.\n\nLooking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President\u2019s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.\n\nWolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman.", "comment_3": "'The Daily Show's' Michelle Wolf Lands Her Own Netflix Late-Night Show (Exclusive) https://t.co/vM3vgYipZb", "split": "train"}

A short list of Francis\u2019s most controversial statements include:\n\nPREACHING THAT \u2018JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN\u2019\n\nPope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of \u201cdebasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself\u201d, and \u201cturning into Satan.\u201d\n\nHardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it\u2019s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.\n\nMaking matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ \u201cmade himself the devil, the serpent, for us,\u201d according to L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.\n\nPREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE \u2018HARMFUL\u2019\n\nThe heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that \u201ca personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ\u201d must be avoided at all costs.\n\n\u201cHaving a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,\u201d the pope said during the June 25 speech.\n\nThe unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.\n\nOPENLY CALLING FOR \u2018ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT\u2019\n\nIn July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has \u201ca distorted vision of the world\u201d and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, \u201cfor their own good.\u201d\n\nThe week before he also called for \u201ca one world government\u201d and \u201cpolitical authority\u201d, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Ecuador\u2019s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control \u201cfor the good of humanity.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a \u201cglobalist bulldog\u201c. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis\u2019s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis\u2019s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.\n\nPope Francis\u2019s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question \u2013 is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?", "comment_3": "#AntiChrist Pope Francis At Mass \u2018Jesus Is Metaphorical, Not Literal\u2019 https://t.co/dPFCyhKAhu via #HNG #Agenda21\u2026 https://t.co/G1ZgZGc90D", "split": "train"}

In an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d the \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I\u2019m not free anymore,\u201d Gaga said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody\u2019s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can\u2019t even call the police to help me because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d the singer complained. \u201cI realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I\u2019d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off \u2013 we\u2019ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.\u201d\n\nAsked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn\u2019t her \u201cfirst choice,\u201d as well as that \u201che couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,\u201d due to the fact that \u201cI might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.\u201d \u201cIt was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven\u2019t been able to do that in a long time,\u201d she revealed.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I\u2019m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,\u201d the singer revealed. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that\u2019ll cover my face, but what I do know is that\u2019s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I\u2019m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody\u2019s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I\u2019m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I\u2019ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,\u201d Gaga concluded.", "comment_3": "Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again \u201cUntil Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More\u201d -... https://t.co/FviaSQLpWk", "split": "train"}

(Photo: Nick Ut, AP)\n\nBumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.\n\nJose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.\n\nWhen a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.\n\nThe company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.\n\nThe charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.\n\nRodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon \u2014 even in fatalities.\n\nSan Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that \"we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.\" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was \"exploring all options with respect to those charges.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.\n\nThefreethoughtproject.com reports: \u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.\n\nThe cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\n\n\u201cSome people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,\u201d Oxenberg said. \u201cCoercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.\u201d\n\nWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.\n\nRaniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.\n\nIn 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.\n\nAlthough this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.\n\nA quick search for Allison Mack\u2019s arrest report or charges\u2014as reported by the mainstream media\u2014will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.\n\nAnother important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.\n\nTheir involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.\n\nAdditionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.\n\nNow that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.\n\nIn response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.\n\nFrank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the enforcer\u2014the brutal one. Clare\u2019s running the [operation] now, and she\u2019s the most ruthless of them. I\u2019m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there\u2019s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.\u201d Parlato said.\n\nOf Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.\n\n\u201cMack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere\u2019s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is \u2018Pimp Mack,\u2018\u201d Parlato said.\n\nIt is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack\u2019s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called \u201cNight Eyes Three.\u201d She was just 11 years old at the time.\n\nBelow you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.", "comment_3": "'Smallville' Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons https://t.co/eVwYl60z8q via @yournewswire", "split": "train"}

The \u201cBe careful what you wish for Max!\u201d quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps \u201cthe Second Amendment people\u201d i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.\n\nWhile some people may consider Trump\u2019s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president\u2019s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.\n\nAnthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd \u201cfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201d\n\nLloyd\u2019s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters\u2019 Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:\n\n\u201cIf you continue to make threats towards the president, you\u2019re going to wind up dead, Maxine, \u2019cause we\u2019ll kill you.\u201c\n\nThe voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump\u2019s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.\n\nThe contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.\n\nWhen those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump\u2019s feet.\n\nCorrection: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trump\u2019s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump\u2019s June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.\n\nPresident Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd\u2019s plea. Therefore the conclusion that Trump\u2019s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid.\n\nJoin millions calling for AG Barr to resign after he defied his constitutional obligations to protect Trump!", "comment_3": "A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her https://t.co/ClbN0jfeba via @anteksiler", "split": "train"}

Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump\u2019s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.\n\nDuring his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.\n\nThe harsh rhetoric of Trump\u2019s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it \u201csome weird s--t\u201d and Jimmy Carter saying he \u201cflinched\u201d when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn Trump\u2019s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.\n\n\u201cThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,\u201d George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. \u201cThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it\u2019s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president\u2026 is pretty unusual.\u201d\n\nAs Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he\u2019s made his displeasure clear.\n\nObama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the protests following Trump\u2019s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal it.\n\nAt a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. \u201cI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,\u201d Obama said Sunday.\n\nAnd on Monday, Obama\u2019s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump\u2019s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn\u2019s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn\u2019s erratic nature.\n\nGeorge W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said in an interview with \u201cToday\u201d in February. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\u201d\n\nAs for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush said.\n\nCarter also voiced concerns after Trump\u2019s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women\u2019s movement would be \u201cinvigorated\u201d by Trump and that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany glimmer of hope\u201d from the administration on race and gender issues.\n\nBill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know much,\u201d Clinton said in late December. \u201cOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.\n\nCriticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that\u2019s not really unprecedented,\u201d Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. \u201cIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nWhile in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.\n\n\u201cMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,\u201d Mack McLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, said.\n\nFor example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.\n\nOthers primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\u201cWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cIf we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.\u201d\n\nAll in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.\n\nBut Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by their first post-election meeting.\n\nTrump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS\u2019 John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.\n\n\u201cHe was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,\u201d Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nAs Barack Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about President Donald Trump. | AP Photo\n\nHistorically speaking, Trump\u2019s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors\u2019 had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. \u201cThat one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,\u201d she said\n\nAnd Trump hasn\u2019t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy!\u201d as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush \u201cnot nice\u201d during the campaign, said the Bush administration \u201clied\u201d about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton \u201cthe WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and Carter weren\u2019t excluded from Trump\u2019s slights. \u201cEnough is Enough- No More Bushses!\u201d Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.\n\nSteven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.\n\nAnd Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and \u2014 while revealing that he voted for Sanders \u2014 Carter said the \"downturn\" of human rights \"preceded 2016.\"\n\n\u201cPresident Carter, I think he hopes that he won\u2019t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cActually, I\u2019m sure he would.\u201d\n\nBoth Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He\u2019s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.\n\n\u201cThey may have personal opinions, but they\u2019re not going to express them,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cBoth 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they\u2019ve been both very cautious about what they say.\u201d\n\nMcLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. \u201cI wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today\u2019s events in Washington.\n\n\u201cI think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,\u201d he said.", "comment_3": "Former presidents walk fine line in Trump\u2019s America https://t.co/P8fw6C94qw via @politico", "split": "train"}

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller\u2019s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.\n\nDenzel affirmed, \u201cIf the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!\u201d\n\nDenzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film \u2018Roman J. Israel, Esq.\u2019 (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn\u2019t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: \u201cThey would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections\u201d.\n\nWhen a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was \u201creliable\u201d, he responded, \u201cHell yeah, it\u2019s reliable. We don\u2019t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what\u2019s happened here\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys can\u2019t see what is wrong with this? You\u2019re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters.

Heather most recently was arrested by officers at a nearby public park. According to police reports and statements from Watson, she had been sitting on bench supervising her 3 other children, age 2, 5, and 7, as they played with other children at the park when her baby become fussy and needed to be fed.\n\nIdaho is currently the only state that has yet to pass a law allowing mothers to breastfeed in public without the consequences of indecent exposure. The only protection that nursing mothers have in Idaho is Jury Duty exemption. A Moveon.org petition was created by The Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition in effort to bring the state up to speed with the remainder of the states throughout the country that protect nursing mothers, however despite the petition\u2019s 4,821 signatures, there is no indication that Idaho is anywhere close to passing new legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to serving a maximum 7-years in prison, because Watson was charged with multiple counts of indecent exposure, she will be required to register as a sex offender and will be placed on the National Sex Offender Registry.\n\nAccording to Heather\u2019s husband and close friends, she was an advocate for mother\u2019s rights and commonly took to social media websites such as Facebook to rant about her frequent indecent exposure citations and to complain about being harassed for breastfeeding her young daughter in a myriad of public locations. The below message was posted to Facebook a few weeks ago by Heather after she received her 4th citation for indecent exposure \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so frickin pissed off by the barbaric, stone-age, laws we have in Idaho. I seriously just received my 4th ticket for the \u201cindecent exposure\u201d of my breast while feeding Caylee in public. You can bet I\u2019m filing this document straight to the IDGAF folder (the trash can)!\u201d\n\nThough Watson\u2019s sentence is widely viewed as unnecessarily strict, Jude Walter Chapman, the sole judge presiding over Baker County and nearby Wiser, Idaho, made the following statement to reporters from a local ABC affiliate station, \u201cWe have laws in our state and due to Mrs. Watson\u2019s repeated civil disobedience it\u2019s is clear to me that she has little to no regard for the system our state was built upon. As a Judge, it\u2019s not my job to create law, but to recognize and preside over it.\u201d\n\nAs news of Watson\u2019s sentencing has spread throughout the media, several public breastfeeding advocate groups have come together to demand change in Idaho\u2019s current laws. They are asking anyone that disagrees with Judge Chapman\u2019s ruling to voice your feedback by calling the Baker County Department of Justice at 785-273-0325.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_3": "Idaho Mother Sentenced To Prison After Multiple Citations For Breastfeeding In Public https://t.co/K2tmzLFhFB via @Associated Media Coverage", "split": "train"}

Intelligence and Z|13 Security, suspect the source of the recent White House leaks to be President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nIf you\u2019ve recently seen the hashtag \u2013 #DitchTheDevice trending on social media, it\u2019s because, according to several private intelligence reports, the source of the multiple recent leaks within the White House is President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nThroughout the past several weeks President Trump and his administration have expressed extreme frustration over the multiple leaks provided to members of the press from inside the White House.\n\nThe recent leaks range from information regarding his executive orders (before he issued them), fighting and chaos among White House staffers, classified conversations with foreign leaders (specifically Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull & Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto), White House staffers conducting meetings in the dark because they can\u2019t figure out how the lights work, and President Trump wandering the White House in his bathrobe.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly dismissed the leaks and has referred to the leaked information as \u2013 \u201cIllegal Leaks\u201d while vowing to go after those revealing sensitive information to the press.\n\nAccording to information from an unconnected Washington insider, President Trump, who remains leery of the federal intelligence community and is suspicious enough of career politicians that he\u2019s accused holdovers from the Obama Administration as being the ones responsible for leaking information, decided to contract multiple private intelligence agencies to investigate the leaks.\n\nInitial reports from two such agencies, A.R.H. Intelligence and Z|13 Security, indicate they suspect the source of the recent White House leaks to be President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nPresident Trump has received fierce criticism since his inauguration for refusing to part with his personal, consumer-grade Android smartphone while in the White House. The primary concern with President Trump maintaining his personal Android device while serving as the POTUS, is that the phone in question is probably not being aggressively protected from malware or phishing attacks/attempts.\n\nAccording to security experts, clicking on just one malicious link (often disguised to look as if it was sent from a trusted source) could easily compromise the device \u2013 giving hackers free-reign over the phone\u2019s microphone, camera, contacts, stored data, and browser history.\n\nInvestigators from A.R.H. Intelligence and Z|13 Security believe that the unsecured Android device was most likely compromised by a suspicious animated GIF that was sent to President Trump via text message.\n\nAccording to information from Thomas McDowell, an associate at A.R.H. Intelligence, the text message containing the GIF (which reportedly displayed an animated cartoon-like image of Trump giving Russian President, Vladimir Putin, a friendly hug) appeared to have been sent to President Trump as a joke by a long-time friend/acquaintance.\n\nMcDowell believes that the animated GIF could have contained spyware and could have been sent by an unknown hacker who coded the text message to appear as if it was sent by a trusted source \u2013 an (unnamed) long-time friend and acquaintance of President Trump.\n\nIf a hacker did gain access to the unsecured Android device, it\u2019s possible they activated the device\u2019s built-in microphone and camera and in-turn leaked the sensitive information gathered to members of the press.\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear if the president intends to rid himself of the unsecured smartphone, however, many of President Trump\u2019s supporters and critics alike have taken to social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook to encourage the president to trade in his unsecured Android phone for a standard White House approved communication device by using the hashtag \u2013 #DitchTheDevice\n\nWe\u2019ll provide updates to this developing story as we receive them.", "comment_3": "BREAKING: Trump\u2019s Android Device Believed To Be Source Of Recent White House Leaks https://t.co/EelNzFLgJy via @The Seattle Tribune", "split": "train"}

RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:\n\nDear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can\u2019t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian\n\nWhat that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he\u2019ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s office has already announced that the election won\u2019t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he\u2019ll waste the taxpayers\u2019 time and money with a fruitless recount.\n\nThey can never just admit when they lost.", "comment_3": "Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes https://t.co/W3amvcr5d9 via @YouTube", "split": "train"}

They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.\n\nNucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 \u2014 $8,832.73 per month \u2014 according to public records.\n\nSixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n*ggers'\u201d. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.\n\nHours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cf*cking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201d\n\nNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\n\n\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conduct alleged is shocking,\u201d acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.\u201d\n\nNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.

Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.\n\nThis year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.\n\nAdd police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer.

Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.\n\nMs. McCrummen\u2019s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona\u2019s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states\u2019 criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.\n\nSean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night.

The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.\n\n\u201cICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,\u201d Fallon tweeted. \u201cDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\u201d\n\nThomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.\n\n\u201cThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,\u201d Homan said Thursday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\nBut the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.\n\n\u201cICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,\u201d Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. \u201cBut let\u2019s not abuse the power.\u201d\n\nSince then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,\u201d Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. \u201cIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.\u201d\n\nMirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- \u201cshould be asked the same question.\u201d\n\nPELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS \u2018UNJUST AND CRUEL\u2019\n\nThe Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\u201d The writer accused the agency of being part of an \u201cunbridled white-supremacist surveillance state\u201d and called it \u201can unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it\u2019s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,\u201d McElwee wrote.\n\nDemocratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff\u2019s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.\n\nSESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR \u2018RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA\u2019\n\nSessions called California\u2019s \"open borders\" policies a \u201cradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can this be a sound policy?\u201d", "comment_3": "Democrats Announce They Will Abolish ICE If They Win 2020 Election https://t.co/yZqHmMIO6c via @yournewswire", "split": "train"}

The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.", "comment_3": "USA SNICH\n\n\"Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President.\"\n\nPOLITIFACT FALSE\u2026 https://t.co/F3TX4eC3iS", "split": "train"}

Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe true explanation is much less exciting.\n\nPrior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date.

It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.\n\nAmericans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.\n\nCruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201d\n\nCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201d\n\nAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201d\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\n\u201cImpeach!\u201d It\u2019s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word \u2013 long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the \u201cI\u201d word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked \u201cWatergate.\u201d\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left\u2019s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America\u2019s new Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,\u201d says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. \u201cNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I\u2019m not going to stop asking them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans\u2019 tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. \u2026 Resign now.\u201d\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned \u201cimpeachment\u201d enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, there\u2019s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\n\u201cThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,\u201d Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless \u201cgotcha\u201d announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence \u201ccorruptly\u201d when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted \u201cwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.\u201d Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

Maybe not my generation, but certainly that of my kids.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland.\n\nAccording to Sputnik News, a member of Finland\u2019s conservative Finn Party recently recommended implanting satellite-tracking chips inside of welfare recipients in response to news that some recipients continued to receive payments after leaving the country to fight for the Islamic State.\n\nPasi Maenranta, the politician who suggested the idea, argued on his Facebook page that in order to receive welfare payments from Kela, \u201cone has to tell exact data about your location using your personal code, read by a satellite.\u201d\n\nMaenranta also noted that it would be possible to implant microchips beneath the skin of all those traveling overseas \u201cwho for example receive medical welfare from Kela,\u201d also known as the Social Insurance Institution.\n\nBut regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips.\n\nCan they ever be turned off or removed? Who exactly will have access to your location should the microchip be equipped with GPS technology?\n\nAnd if the microchips contain personal information regarding health and finances, will it be possible for that information to be hacked and potentially sold by a third party?\n\nIf Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made.\n\nSource humansarefree", "comment_3": "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future - https://t.co/24HdNd3zwE via @Shareaholic", "split": "train"}

But this last on was truly an Obama move.\n\nThe liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration\u2019s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?\n\n\u201cThe funny thing,\u201d a White House official said, \u201cis that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,\u201d he went on, \u201cno one in the press would say it was her staffs\u2019 fault.\u201d\n\nThat is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?\n\n(h/t Young Conservatives)", "comment_3": "As expected G20 summit has proved to be a great FLOP!

Staff and students got on the floor in locked classrooms, with reports that the gunman shot through windows or doors.\n\nHannah Siren, 14, who was in maths class, told the Orlando Sentinel: \"The people next door to us must have not locked their door.They all got shot.\"\n\nStudent Alexa Miednik said she briefly spoke to Cruz as she and others rushed outside after the fire alarm went off and gunshots were heard.\n\nShe said: \"As we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz, and as I was speaking to him he seemed very, I don\u2019t know what the word I want to say is, but he was troubled in middle school.\n\n\"So, I kind of joked to him about it and said I\u2019m surprised you weren\u2019t the one who did it, and he just gave me a 'huh?'\"\n\nAs the lockdown was lifted after the rampage, bewildered students and staff streamed out of the school with their hands in the air, passing heavily-armed and helmeted police officers wearing combat gear.\n\nTwelve of the dead were killed inside the school, while two others were shot just outside. One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital.\n\nThe school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes.\n\nCruz - described by former classmates as a \"troubled\" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested just after 4pm by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots.\n\nPolice said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle.\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBrent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school.\n\nHe said: \"About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what\u2019s wrong with you?'\n\n\"And he was like 'umm, don\u2019t know.' And I was like 'what\u2019s up with you?'\n\n\"He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you\u2019re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.\"\n\nStudents told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nAttorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death.\n\nA source told CNN that Cruz had purchased the gun in the past year after passing a background check.\n\nCruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported.\n\nThe couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: \u201cIt was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.\u201d\n\nLewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe lawyer said Cruz was \"depressed\" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in \"didn\u2019t see this coming\".\n\nA relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Cruz was questioned for hours by detectives before he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Officers searched a number of properties linked to the suspect, including the home where he was living with a family friend.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security were assisting with the investigation.\n\nFormer classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns.\n\nThey also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.\n\nBroward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school.\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nBut maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack.\n\nHe added: \"There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.\"\n\nPhotos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as \u201cvery, very disturbing\".\n\nIt also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago.\n\nOne comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read \"I am going to what he did\" [sic].\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\nAnother YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: \"I want to be a professional school shooter.\"\n\nThe FBI were alerted to that post in September and carried out an investigation, but it was unclear what, if anything, happened from there.\n\nWhen Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his \"strange talking sometimes about knives and guns\", but said \"no one ever took him seriously\".\n\nChad Williams, 18, described Cruz as \"kind of an outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns\" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nTrevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed \"a little off\" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.\n\nFormer schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: \"He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.\"\n\nFormer neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens.\n\nAnother former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: \u201cHe wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.\u201d\n\nWednesday's shooting ranked as the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history and the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town.\n\nLanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene.\n\nThe number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years, and the Parkland shooting is just the latest chapter in the longtime debate over preventative measures, including gun control.\n\nThere were fresh calls for the US government to do more to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nUS President Donald Trump didn't mention any potential preventative measures in his response to the attack.\n\nHe appeared to suggest that those who were aware of the warning signs didn't do enough to alert authorities beforehand.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\"\n\n(Image: Photodisc)\n\nIn earlier tweets, he wrote: \"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\n\n\"Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.\"\n\nReports from the US indicated that local police had dealt with Cruz on several occasions, he had been kicked out of school and staff were warned about him, and the FBI had investigated the \"professional school shooter\" comment that appeared to be posted by him on YouTube.\n\nAs well, CNN reported that Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle after passing a background check.\n\nJoe Melita, former head of the Professional Standards & Special Investigative Unit at Broward County Public Schools, told Action News Jax that that several district security officials were aware of Cruz\n\nHe added: \u201cThey were familiar with who the young man was.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: \"I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.\"\n\nMeanwhile there have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven, US media reported.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days.\n\nWednesday's school shooting occurred about 20 months after mass killer Omar Mateen, 29, murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, called Pulse, in Orlando Florida. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by police.\n\nThe June 2016 massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history until gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October.\n\nPaddock shot and killed himself before police stormed the Mandalay Bay hotel room he had used into a sniper's perch.", "comment_3": "The mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate.

A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.\n\nMany have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she\u2019d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.\n\nMichelle\u2019s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that\u2019s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.\n\nBiz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama\u2019s administration before Trump took office:\n\nWhy is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband\u2019s presidency?\n\nDr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, \u201cOn Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.\u201d\n\nWright diagnosed Mrs. Obama\u2019s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in legacy building mode. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is the time she\u2019s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.\u201d\n\nAs First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.\n\n\u201cI think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that\u2019s been true over the last three administrations,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOf her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she\u2019s now suffering a feeling of \u201chopelessness\u201d with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It\u2019s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.\n\nThe best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.\n\nDean James from America\u2019s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she\u2019s more than profited off of:\n\nSo, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness\u2026 This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.\n\nHey lady, I hate to break it to you but your \u2018husband\u2019 has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.\n\nThe truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.", "comment_3": "Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor https://t.co/HKmnJlQlj7 via @YouTube", "split": "train"}

Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham.

However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a \u2018mental image\u2019 rather than a direct record of reality\u2019\n\nJackson\u2019s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson\u2019s productions \u2013 where the likenesses are recognisable \u2013 use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation.", "comment_3": "Re: Local variables can't be accessed from outside, right?: \n On Nov 28, 1:15\u00a0pm, Michael Winterstein &lt;parzi.. http://bit.ly/4rEcyJ", "split": "train"}

In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.\n\n\u201cIf the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,\u201d Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. \u201cWashington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.\n\n\u201cWe did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you\u2019ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think this is the best thing,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cHe has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it\u2019s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.\u201d\n\nAfter word spread of Trump\u2019s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well.

The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor?

But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama.

Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.\n\nPolitico\u2019s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as \u201cus\u201d in his speech. \u201cJust noticed the use of \u2018us\u2019 in this transcript,\u201d wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.\n\n\u201cOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?\u201d she wrongly quoted the president as saying\n\nSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the \u201calt-left\u201d (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.\n\nIn the speech, Trump clearly says \u201cOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at \u2018em?\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them\u2026today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD \u2014 Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017\n\nAs Karni\u2019s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some\u2014including CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. \u201cTranscript may be funky,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOthers, like New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.\n\nHaberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.\n\nDespite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some.

Perhaps then we could figure out why they\u2019re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if \u201cwestern culture\u201d offends them so!\n\nAccording to Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which is campaigning against Australia because they believe the country, is enforcing democratic values and a \u201cdisputed view\u201d of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs.\n\n\u201cRequiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of \u2018forced assimilation\u2019 of the Muslim community.\u201d\n\nHizb-ut-Tahrir spokesmen, Unthman Badar said; Well, if there\u2019s one culture that knows a thing or two about \u201cforced assimilation\u201d it would be Islam.\n\nHe continued; \u201cThat this supposed oppression is due to an \u201cexaggerated fear of a security threat\u201d.\n\nObviously when \u201cdocumented events\u201d of world-wide terrorism inflicted within the last 2-decades has been overwhelming committed by Muslims in the name of Islam, the \u201cexaggerated fear, becomes all too real.\n\nMoreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that those seeking entrance do so with an understanding that they will adhere to the principles, and or laws of that host country.\n\nIf those seeking entrance can not abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter\u2026it\u2019s really that simple.\n\nDo you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their hows nation or be allowed to make demands that things are changed to suit them?\n\nVia: Supreme Patriot", "comment_3": "MUSLIMS OFFENDED THAT THEIR KIDS HAVE TO RECITE NATIONAL ANTHEM, CLAIM IT\u2019S RACIST TO FORCE THEM TO\u2026 https://t.co/GnlDCO4T2Y", "split": "train"}
