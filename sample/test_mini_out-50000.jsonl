{"comment_3": "Stop coddling the super-rich: Buffett http://t.co/1wl9JPJC via @globeandmail", "article": "To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\n\nBack in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack.

Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th.

It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform. And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.\n\nOur collective failure to meet this challenge \u2013 year after year, decade after decade \u2013 has led us to a breaking point. Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare.

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States.

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and e", "comment_2": "READ: See the Actual Letter Gov.

Just the facts, all in one place.\n\nWhy did Clinton use her own email account?\n\nWhen Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.\n\nThat is the only reason she used her own account.\n\nHer usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.\n\nAs Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.\n\nWas it allowed?\n\nYes.

Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake.

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework.

What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing", "comment_2": "The Original \"Woke\" Economist: An Interview with Dr. Thomas Sowell, Part II https://t.co/qylzdLGhXr", "comment_1": "@alistairhann @TheEconomist Excellent interview with William MacAskill on the same topic - https://t.co/U6G2hYtJ5u", "split": "gen", "target": "real", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_comment_1": ["CNN Perhaps Not necessarily flush out of the United States\u2026 https://t.co/l Newark, director of the President Barack Obama\u2019S.co/Kn17Jj6CaudR via @snopes\n\n provoked it was caught the new dinosaur boneTvsoIC on the U.co/DQ3aWR0aDVJTxlL via @Bh"], "gensraw_comment_1": [[18475, 8674, 1893, 6647, 24774, 504, 287, 263, 1579, 1830, 1400, 3741, 1379, 84, 14, 1074, 15, 76, 30971, 12, 3438, 287, 263, 1993, 8733, 2487, 448, 248, 51, 14, 1074, 15, 25096, 1559, 42, 74, 22, 35, 3886, 50, 2885, 2489, 16185, 13921, 199, 199, 29580, 341, 374, 4979, 263, 650, 28258, 9971, 52, 86, 569, 2150, 320, 263, 472, 14, 1074, 15, 36, 49, 19, 65, 18565, 16, 65, 36, 54, 42, 46048, 76, 44, 2885, 2489, 34, 72, 50260]], "probs_comment_1": [[0.005643954500555992, 0.01141154021024704, 0.013936709612607956, 0.006797498092055321, 0.5180056095123291, 0.8833787441253662, 0.9053996205329895, 0.9167715311050415, 0.2067825049161911, 0.9999244213104248, 0.45358195900917053, 0.9999345541000366, 0.9999982118606567, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9999932050704956, 0.07020946592092514, 2.8735172236338258e-05, 0.9997294545173645, 0.002621169900521636, 0.9290241003036499, 0.6599389910697937, 0.5092016458511353, 0.12835754454135895, 0.9999994039535522, 0.5451104044914246, 0.9921720027923584, 0.47989073395729065, 0.9711892008781433, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999983310699463, 0.20692777633666992, 0.005041021388024092, 0.10912811011075974, 0.003984720911830664, 0.5604296326637268, 0.9889000654220581, 0.7860995531082153, 0.9885815978050232, 0.23195794224739075, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9067347049713135, 0.9981003403663635, 0.9997290968894958, 0.999947190284729, 0.00018841754354070872, 0.9944654107093811, 0.831244170665741, 0.1641385853290558, 0.825475811958313, 0.5424653887748718, 0.011359755881130695, 0.6550368070602417, 1.9574938050936908e-05, 0.04406029358506203, 0.010916847735643387, 0.6086902618408203, 0.14658546447753906, 0.9919393658638, 0.9779683947563171, 0.999970555305481, 0.999160885810852, 0.9999991655349731, 0.5881040692329407, 0.9713765978813171, 0.015826404094696045, 0.7620444297790527, 0.6381657719612122, 0.5676122307777405, 0.987851619720459, 0.8218506574630737, 0.8324221968650818, 0.21841907501220703, 0.43824395537376404, 0.9997528195381165, 0.9923340082168579, 0.9998000264167786, 0.9999954700469971, 0.48519015312194824, 0.961033284664154, 0.8473111987113953]]}

Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn\u2019t happy and demanded the format be changed.\n\nAccording to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly\u2019s new show:\n\n\u201cMegyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she\u2019s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.\u201d\n\nThe problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books", "comment_2": "BREAKING: NBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins https://t.co/5GjKZELFOe https://t.co/2AY1feBzwT", "comment_1": "BREAKING: NBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins https://t.co/cweg0eoOdb", "split": "gen", "target": "fake", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_comment_1": ["BREAKING:co/vI'm sorry; he has run FALSE\u2026 https://t.co/KnDJteacher - @the American MeternaDhJ7GP5pm via @yKVAogas36W via @nyjips; Then Then Then Then he 'Why didn't take a Arrested In Rosatom (Dqx1qt"], "gensraw_comment_1": [[40439, 43603, 26, 1074, 15, 86, 41, 1102, 7927, 27, 340, 469, 1058, 26564, 1400, 3741, 1379, 84, 14, 1074, 15, 25096, 36, 42, 661, 3494, 533, 2489, 1170, 1606, 2186, 760, 65, 36, 72, 42, 23, 16961, 21, 80, 77, 2885, 2489, 89, 43, 11732, 520, 293, 2624, 55, 2885, 2489, 3282, 74, 2420, 27, 3245, 3245, 3245, 3245, 340, 706, 5196, 1423, 471, 1012, 258, 35081, 277, 555, 10019, 37697, 358, 36, 81, 88, 17, 39569, 50260]], "probs_comment_1": [[0.7892000675201416, 0.9997389912605286, 0.9998785257339478, 0.8949022889137268, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9298112392425537, 0.423662394285202, 0.8481365442276001, 0.2084786742925644, 0.250468373298645, 0.9857799410820007, 0.6426112055778503, 0.005832263734191656, 1.7906693756231107e-05, 0.7828935384750366, 0.9999414682388306, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9967523813247681, 0.9999889135360718, 0.9999972581863403, 0.03774157911539078, 0.3825077712535858, 0.006417660973966122, 0.01875428296625614, 0.19282463192939758, 0.8666334748268127, 0.0021952467504888773, 0.8764594197273254, 0.03792993724346161, 0.11559829860925674, 0.00015382167475763708, 0.07632811367511749, 0.5642028450965881, 0.024340571835637093, 0.5731936097145081, 0.019460603594779968, 0.02315400168299675, 0.9676703810691833, 0.0045191519893705845, 0.00035921428934670985, 0.5737467408180237, 0.9999778270721436, 0.44134271144866943, 0.00018439916311763227, 0.009205165319144726, 0.10311894863843918, 0.6629114747047424, 0.3825834095478058, 0.9943482279777527, 0.12304501980543137, 0.9999880790710449, 0.013807645067572594, 0.11837809532880783, 8.868238364811987e-05, 0.08683834969997406, 0.00854044035077095, 0.7910954356193542, 0.05923227220773697, 0.7117189168930054, 0.7758374810218811, 0.04458845034241676, 0.041745975613594055, 0.2888924479484558, 0.9709939360618591, 0.9511288404464722, 0.9992526173591614, 0.001257292809896171, 0.6356931328773499, 0.85854172706604, 0.0378921702504158, 0.9538651704788208, 0.31486502289772034, 0.9104911684989929, 0.7836037874221802, 0.03396012261509895, 0.9113684296607971, 0.8010585904121399, 0.9979020357131958]]}

I have created something that no future president will be able to do.

In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.\n\nHave this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe true explanation is much less exciting.\n\nPrior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date.

A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.\n\nMany have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention.
