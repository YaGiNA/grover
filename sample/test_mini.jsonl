Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.\n\n\n\nRyan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.\n\n\n\nToday, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.\n\n\n\nRyan\u2019s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called \"premium support.\")\n\n\n\nThough House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan\u2019s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.\n\n\n\nThe Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut \"$700 billion\" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!\n\n\n\nFor this check, we\u2019re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.\n\n\n\n\"You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,\" Cutter said. \"You know what those cuts are? It\u2019s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to digest if you\u2019re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them \"cuts\" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.\n\n\n\n$700 billion in Medicare cuts?\n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?\n\n\n\nWell, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally \"cut\" a dollar from the Medicare program\u2019s budget.\n\n\n\nRather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.\n\n\n\nHospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\n\n\n\nStill, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would \"cut\" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we\u2019ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.\n\n\n\nBecause Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law\u2019s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.\n\n\n\nThe CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s timing that\u2019s making the \"cuts\" bigger, not changes to Medicare.\n\n\n\nDoes the Ryan budget \u2018protect those cuts\u2019?\n\n\n\nNow onto our second question: Does Ryan\u2019s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney\u2019s running mate:\n\n\n\nStephanopoulos: \"You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.\n\n\n\nRyan: \"Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ...\" (Read the full exchange.)\n\n\n\nSo Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.\n\n\n\nThe Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter\u2019s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.\n\n\n\n\"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama\u2019s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\" said Lanhee Chen, Romney\u2019s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. \"A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.\"\n\n\n\nCutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn\u2019t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn\u2019t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n\nStill, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nCutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but \"Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan.\n\nCutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney\u2019s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.\n\n\n\nStill, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True."}

NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate. Here is a transcript of that debate.\n\nSen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate.\n\nBrokaw: Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates.\n\nFrom all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.\n\nNeither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we won't be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election.\n\nEach candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.\n\nThe only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\nGentlemen?\n\nGentlemen, we want to get under way immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.\n\nAs you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions.\n\nI understand that you flipped a coin.\n\nAnd, Sen. Obama, you will begin tonight. And we're going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Allen Shaffer.\n\nAllen?\n\nShaffer: With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what's the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin?\n\nObama: Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.\n\nI think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.\n\nAnd I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Sen. McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.\n\nIt hasn't worked out that way. And so now we've got to take some decisive action.\n\nNow, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We've got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.\n\nIt means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that's only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.\n\nIt means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.\n\nAnd then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Sen. Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.\n\nAnd, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. It's our job to fix the problem.\n\nNow, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much. We have to keep Americans' taxes low. All Americans' taxes low. Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.\n\nWe obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington. Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?\n\nWe've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.\n\nYou know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.\n\nIs it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.\n\nI know how the do that, my friends. And it's my proposal, it's not Sen. Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.\n\nBrokaw: Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he won't stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Not you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: No, with good reason.\n\nMcCain: You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.\n\nA supporter of Sen. Obama's is Warren Buffett [chairman of Berkshire Hathaway]. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.\n\nI like Meg Whitman [former CEO of eBay and current McCain campaign adviser], she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.\n\nBut the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrokaw: All right. Sen. McCain -- Sen. Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?\n\nObama: Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.\n\nProsperity is not just going to trickle down. We've got to help the middle class.\n\nAnd we've -- you know, Sen. McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Sen. McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.\n\nPart of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.\n\nAnd that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSen. McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, thank you very much.\n\nMay I remind both of you, if I can, that we're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so.\n\nWe're going to go now, Sen. McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark, who is over here in section F.\n\nOliver?\n\nClark: Well, Senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time. And through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.\n\nI left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.\n\nBut you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.\n\nBut you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.\n\nAnd you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change.\n\nMeanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Sen. Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.\n\nSo this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it's not enough. That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.\n\nBut Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.\n\nIf they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll. If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.\n\nAnd if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.\n\nSo it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action. But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.\n\nNow, I've got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain's history, not surprisingly. Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.\n\nSen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.\n\nI wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben] Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.\n\nA year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.\n\nAnd Sen. McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.\n\nNow, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Sen. McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.\n\nAnd I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Sen. McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.\n\nSo -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?\n\nThis is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.\n\nThe secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, time for a discussion. I'm going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?\n\nObama: No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.\n\nThe problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.\n\nBut most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?\n\nMcCain: I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.\n\nMy friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Sen. Obama's name was not on that letter.\n\nThe point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans' workers are the best in the world. They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.\n\nThey're the most innovative. They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters. We're the best importers. They're most effective. They are the best workers in the world.\n\nAnd we've got to give them a chance. They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you, Sen. McCain.\n\nWe're going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.\n\nSen. Obama, this is a question from you from Teresa Finch.\n\nTeresa?\n\nFinch: How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis?\n\nObama: Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car.\n\nThat's not what happens in Washington. And you're right. There is a lot of blame to go around.\n\nBut I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.\n\nWhen George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. It's now over $10 trillion. We've almost doubled it.\n\nAnd so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.\n\nSo here's what I would do. I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.\n\nYou know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.\n\nWe are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future. We've got to have a different energy plan.\n\nWe've got to invest in college affordability. So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts. And what I've proposed, you'll hear Sen. McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.\n\nThe key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests. We've got to put an end to that.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Theresa (ph), thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer.\n\nI have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Sen. [Russ] Feingold [D-Wisconsin] on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Sen. Lieberman on trying to address climate change.\n\nI have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Sen. Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform.\n\nAnd so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That's really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.\n\nI don't expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you'll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.\n\nDo you know that Sen. Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?\n\nHe voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?\n\nI think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.\n\nYou're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.\n\nBrokaw: We've run out of time. We have this one-minute discussion period going on here.\n\nThere are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: The three priorities were health...\n\nBrokaw: The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?\n\nMcCain: I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think it's very important that reform our entitlement programs.\n\nMy friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today. We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.\n\nI know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That's my clear record.\n\nWe can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.\n\nMy friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.\n\nAs far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That's the next issue.\n\nBut we can do them all at once. There's no -- and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.\n\nBrokaw: I'm trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion.\n\nSen. Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.\n\nObama: We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.\n\nEnergy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.\n\nSo we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.\n\nAnd we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one.\n\nHealth care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.\n\nAnd, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.\n\nBut just one point I want to make, Tom. Sen. McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records.\n\nSen. McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that's important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.\n\nBut understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Sen. McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.\n\nAnd so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you. That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.\n\nSen. McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiorra from Chicago.\n\nSince World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in?\n\nMcCain: Well, Fiorra, I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.\n\nI first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.\n\nI know a lot of them that aren't working. One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.\n\nI believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Sen. Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.\n\nAnd they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.\n\nSo we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.\n\nAnd some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.\n\nAnd, by the way, I want to go back a second.\n\nLook, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.\n\nFrankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, \"I'm sorry, you'll have to wait.\" I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nSen. Obama?\n\nObama: You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.\n\nAnd President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"\n\nThat wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.\n\nAnd so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.\n\nAnd let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.\n\nI believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.\n\nWe're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.\n\nBut each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.\n\nAnd that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.\n\nAnd the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.\n\nThat's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you'll remember, last summer, said that \"Wall Street got drunk.\"\n\nA lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.\n\nHow would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?\n\nObama: Well, I think it starts with Washington. We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \"Well, you know what? There's easy money out there.\"\n\nIt means -- and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Sen. McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.\n\nNow, when Sen. McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.\n\nAnd so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.\n\nI mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.\n\nAnd that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the- board freeze.\n\nThat's an example of an unfair burden sharing. That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.\n\nI want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Sen. McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.\n\nThat's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, you know, nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.\n\nBut he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.\n\nYou know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Sen. Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.\n\nSmall businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Sen. Obama's tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.\n\nI've got some news, Sen. Obama, the news is bad. So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.\n\nTo giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Sen. Obama's plan calls for. And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again. And let's not raise anybody's taxes.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, we have another question from the Internet.\n\nObama: Tom, can I respond to this briefly? Because...\n\nBrokaw: Well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this. This will address, I think, the next question.\n\nObama: The tax issue, because I think it's very important. Go ahead.\n\nBrokaw: There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position.\n\nSince the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.\n\nObama: Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly. We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.\n\nBut I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Sen. McCain, I think the \"Straight Talk Express\" lost a wheel on that one.\n\nSo let's be clear about my tax plan and Sen. McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.\n\nIf you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.\n\nAnd we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.\n\nNow, in contrast, Sen. McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.\n\nHe wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn't work.\n\nNow, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Sen. McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?\n\nMcCain: Sure. Hey, I'll answer the question. Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom. It's just...\n\nBrokaw: And Medicare.\n\nMcCain: ... tough decisions. I want to get to Medicare in a second.\n\nSocial Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. We've got to sit down together across the table. It's been done before.\n\nI saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts. That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.\n\nSen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I've taken them on. I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.\n\nSo Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher. It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.\n\nMy friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.\n\nLet's not let them fool with it anymore. There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, \"Fix it for us.\"\n\nNow, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Sen. Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.\n\nWhen he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?\n\nSo let's look at our record. I've fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government.\n\nLet's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we'll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much. I'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here.\n\nThe next question does come from the hall for Sen. McCain. It comes from Section C over here, and it's from Ingrid Jackson.\n\nIngrid?\n\nJackson: Sen. McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.\n\nBut when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.\n\nAnd I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That's the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.\n\nNow, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Sen. Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.\n\nLook, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nAnd -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Sen. Obama has opposed that.\n\nWe can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.\n\nWe can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.\n\nAnd it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.\n\nIt can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.\n\nAnd we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.\n\nAnd that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.\n\nBut this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.\n\nWhat Sen. McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.\n\nSo it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.\n\nOne last point I want to make on energy. Sen. McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.\n\nSo what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.\n\nWe're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.\n\nWe've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.\n\nBrokaw: Gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here. They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal...\n\nObama: I'm just trying to keep up with John.\n\nMcCain: Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.\n\nBrokaw: All right, Senator.\n\nHere's a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion. It's a simple question.\n\nMcCain: Sure.\n\nBrokaw: Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?\n\nMcCain: I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.\n\nBy the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.\n\nYou know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.\n\nI vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.\n\nThat's fundamental economics. We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.\n\nAnd as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Sen. Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAnd I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave. Thanks.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Senator.\n\nNext question for you, Sen. Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and it's from Lindsey Trella.\n\nLindsey?\n\nTrella: Senator, selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry.\n\nDo you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?\n\nObama: Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.\n\nIf you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.\n\nSo one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.\n\nSo here's what I would do. If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.\n\nAnd we're going to do it by investing in prevention. We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.\n\nIf you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Sen. McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.\n\nSo what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.\n\nIn fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\n\nThat, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need. We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you for the question. You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.\n\nAnd we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Let's have community health centers. Let's have walk-in clinics. Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.\n\nBut what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Sen. Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.\n\nIf you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Sen. Obama will fine you. Will fine you. That's remarkable. If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Sen. Obama will fine you.\n\nI want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.\n\nAnd if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.\n\nYou know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.\n\nObviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.\n\nBrokaw: Quick discussion. Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member. And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.\n\nBut government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about. But it is certainly my responsibility. It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. American citizens understand that. Employers understand that.\n\nBut they certainly are a little nervous when Sen. Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined. And, by the way, Sen. Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. Perhaps we might find that out tonight.\n\nObama: Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.\n\nBrokaw: Privilege, right or responsibility. Let's start with that.\n\nObama: Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.\n\nSo let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Sen. McCain through a lot of stuff out there.\n\nNumber one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor. There's no mandate involved.\n\nSmall businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.\n\nNow, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.\n\nAnd when Sen. McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.\n\nNow, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.\n\nAnd the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.\n\nThat's how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.\n\nAnd in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.\n\nThat is a fundamental difference that I have with Sen. McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That's what we've been going through for the last eight years. It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.\n\nBrokaw: Sen., we want to move on now. If we'd come back to the hall here, we're going to shift gears here a little bit and we're going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can...\n\nMcCain: I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?\n\nBrokaw: Phil Elliott is over here in this section, and Phil Elliott has a question for Sen. McCain.\n\nPhil?\n\nElliott: Yes. Sen. McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?\n\nMcCain: Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. And that is one of the challenges that America faces.\n\nBut having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism. I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.\n\nBut the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.\n\nSo we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.\n\nAnd that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.\n\nAnd I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.\n\nSen. Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.\n\nWe don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.\n\nObama: Well, you know, Sen. McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand.\n\nI don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.\n\nThat was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.\n\nWhen Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.\n\nThat was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.\n\nSo one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.\n\nBut it's also put an enormous strain on our budget. We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Sen. McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.\n\nWe're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.\n\nAnd we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Sen. McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.\n\nAnd the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.\n\nThat's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Sen. McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy. It has not worked for America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, let me ask you if -- let's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where there's a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security.\n\nTake the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia.\n\nWhat is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we don't have national security issues at stake?\n\nObama: Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.\n\nIf we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?\n\nIf we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.\n\nSo when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.\n\nAnd so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.\n\nBut understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world. We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.\n\nLet's take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWe could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.\n\nMcCain: Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Sen. Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which Gen. [David] Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.\n\nThere was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Sen. Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.\n\nThe United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.\n\nBut it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.\n\nWe went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.\n\nIn Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn't. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.\n\nSo you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way. And, again, I know those situations.\n\nI've been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.\n\nAnd I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won't take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nNext question for Sen. Obama, it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm. Katie?\n\nHamm: Should the United States respect Pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al Qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there, or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in Cambodia during the Vietnam War?\n\nObama: Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.\n\nSo what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.\n\nThey are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They're stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.\n\nThey are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end. So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.\n\nBut I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.\n\nWhat I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.\n\nAnd if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Katie (ph), thank you.\n\nYou know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick. Sen. Obama likes to talk loudly.\n\nIn fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable.\n\nYou know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.\n\nWhen you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.\n\nNow, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaeda, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.\n\nNow, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.\n\nNow, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people.\n\nWe need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.\n\nAnd by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.\n\nObama: Tom, just a...\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain...\n\nObama: ... just a quick follow-up on this. I think...\n\nMcCain: If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.\n\nBrokaw: No, I know. So but I think we get at it...\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me. It'd be fine with me.\n\nBrokaw: ... if I can, with this question.\n\nObama: Then let's have one.\n\nBrokaw: All right, let's have a follow-up.\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me.\n\nObama: Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.\n\nBrokaw: I'm just the hired help here, so, I mean...\n\nObama: You're doing a great job, Tom.\n\nLook, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said. Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan. Sen. McCain continues to repeat this.\n\nWhat I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.\n\nNow, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.\n\nMcCain: Thank you very much.\n\nObama: Sen. McCain, this is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea. That I don't think is an example of \"speaking softly.\"\n\nThis is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, \"Next up, Baghdad.\"\n\nSo I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly. And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties. We were not promoting democracy.\n\nThis is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.\n\nMcCain: And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...\n\nBrokaw: Yes, you get the...\n\nMcCain: ... to -- to -- to...\n\nBrokaw: ... last word here, and then we have to move on.\n\nMcCain: Not true. Not true. I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.\n\nI understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way. I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this. I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.\n\nBut the point is that I know how to handle these crises. And Sen. Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words. I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I'll get him. I know how to get him.\n\nI'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it. But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Sen. Obama did. And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.\n\nAnd we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.\n\nBrokaw: Can I get a quick response from the two of you about developments in Afghanistan this week? The senior British military commander, who is now leading there for a second tour, and their senior diplomatic presence there, Sherard Cowper-Coles, who is well known as an expert in the area, both have said that we're failing in Afghanistan.\n\nThe commander said we cannot win there. We've got to get it down to a low level insurgency, let the Afghans take it over. Cowper-Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator.\n\nIf either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize Afghanistan's strategy or do you? Briefly, if you can.\n\nObama: I'll be very brief. We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.\n\nGen. [David] McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.\n\nWe're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, \"You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.\"\n\nI don't think he has to be a dictator. And we want a democracy in Afghanistan. But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, briefly.\n\nMcCain: Gen. Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.\n\nAnd I've had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Sen. Obama is correct on.\n\nWe have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.\n\nBut most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Sen. Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.\n\nHe still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.\n\nAnd once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.\n\nSo I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, this question is for you from the Internet. It's from Alden in Hewitt, Texas.\n\nHow can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War?\n\nMcCain: First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.\n\nBut have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.\n\nNow, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.\n\nI said before, watch Ukraine. Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Georgia.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Ukraine. We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.\n\nWe have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.\n\nAnd so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.\n\nBut the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama.\n\nMcCain: It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama? We're winding down, so if we can keep track of the time.\n\nObama: Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Sen. McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.\n\nBut we can't just provide moral support. We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.\n\nThe other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners. We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.\n\nAnd you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.\n\nWe haven't been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Sen. McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.\n\nWe've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.\n\nAnd one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.\n\nBrokaw: This requires only a yes or a no. Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire. Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire?\n\nObama: I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Maybe.\n\nBrokaw: Maybe.\n\nMcCain: Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things. If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War. If I say no, it ignores their behavior.\n\nObviously energy is going to be a big, big factor. And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.\n\nBut the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.\n\nBrokaw: All right. We're going to try to get in two more questions, if we can. So we have to move along. Over in section A, Terry Shirey -- do I have that right, Terry?\n\nShirey: Senator, as a retired Navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country. I know both candidates, both of you, expressed support for Israel.\n\nIf, despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel, would you be willing to commit U.S. troops in support and defense of Israel? Or would you wait on approval from the U.N. Security Council?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Terry (ph). And thank you for your service to the country.\n\nI want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer. And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend. Thanks for serving.\n\nLet -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council. I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.\n\nAnd our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat. It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel. It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.\n\nIf Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up.\n\nWhat would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?\n\nNow, Sen. Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.\n\nI want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that.\n\nI think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.\n\nWe cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nAnd so it's unacceptable. And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.\n\nAnd we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.\n\nIt is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.\n\nAnd that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them.\n\nNow, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.\n\nIf you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.\n\nNow, it may not work. But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.\n\nWhen President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.\n\nWe've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, we've come to the last question.\n\nAnd you'll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and it's from a state that you're strongly contesting, both of you. It's from Peggy in Amherst, New Hampshire. And it has a certain Zen-like quality, I'll give you a fair warning.\n\nShe says, \"What don't you know and how will you learn it?\"\n\nSen. Obama, you get first crack at that.\n\nObama: My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do. And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.\n\nBut, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect. It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.\n\nBut here's what I do know. I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.\n\nDespite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.\n\nThe same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.\n\nAnd the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.\n\nWages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.\n\nAnd we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.\n\nWe need fundamental change. That's what's at stake in this election. That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.\n\nBut we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.\n\nThank you.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, you get the last word. Sen. Obama had the opening. You're last up.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.\n\nThe challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.\n\nThere are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.\n\nSo what I don't know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business. My mother basically raised our family.\n\nI know what it's like in dark times. I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times. I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.\n\nI know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.\n\nThat's what America's all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.\n\nAnd I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.\n\nThank you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Sen. McCain.\n\nThat concludes tonight's debate from here in Nashville. We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And you're in my way of my script there, if you will move.\n\nIn addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday, October 15, at Hofstra University in New York, moderated by my friend, Bob Schieffer of \"CBS News.\"\n\nThank you, Sen. McCain. Thank you, Sen. Obama. Good night, everyone, from Nashville. iReport.com: Who do you think won the debate?\n\nAll About U.S. Presidential Election \u2022 John McCain \u2022 Barack Obama"}

I've learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.\n\nAnd that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nShe has made history not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.\n\nI congratulate her on her victory in South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Children's Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.\n\nOur party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are independents and Republicans who understand this election isn't just about a change of party in Washington, but also about the need to change Washington.\n\nThere are young people, and African-Americans, and Hispanic- Americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAll of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard. You didn't do that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou didn't do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe owe our children a better future. We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.\n\nIn just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. (APPLAUSE)\n\nI honor, we honor the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy differences with him -- my differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.\n\nIt's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.\n\nIt's not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.\n\nIt's not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the American people any safer.\n\nSo I'll say this: There are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new, but \"change\" is not one of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\"Change\" is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must.\n\nIt's time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. It's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaida's leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. That's what change is.\n\nChange, Minnesota, is realizing that meeting today's threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough, direct diplomacy, where the president of the United States isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. That's what the American people demand. That's what change is.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nChange is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. It's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJohn McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill, he'd understand she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy.\n\nShe needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it. That's the change we need, Minnesota. (APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.\n\nThat man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. That's the change we need, Minnesota.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American.\n\nThat's the change we need in America. That's why I'm running for president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, the other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing. That is a debate I look forward to.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt is a debate that the American people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children.\n\nBut what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear, and innuendo, and division. What you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat you won't see from this campaign or this party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans, but we are Americans first. We are always Americans first.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDespite what the good senator from Arizona may have said tonight, I've seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and I've brought many together myself.\n\nI've walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black, white, and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools.\n\nI've sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row.\n\nI've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIn our country, I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again.\n\nSo it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union.\n\nSo it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity.\n\nSo it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedom's cause.\n\nSo it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better and kinder and more just.\n\nAnd so it must be for us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica, this is our moment. This is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past...\n\n(APPLAUSE) ... our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love.\n\nThe journey will be difficult. The road will be long. I face this challenge -- I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... this was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.\n\nThank you, Minnesota. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America."}

Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."}

So true https://t.co/dcpHmokmFD", "article": "John McCain's Acceptance Speech\n\n\n\n\n\nBy John McCain\n\nSeptember 5, 2008 Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans -- the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence.\n\n\n\nIn my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won't forget.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are -- victims of land mines, children born in poverty and with birth defects -- shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady.\n\n\n\nWhen I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.\n\n\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.\n\n\n\nFinally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement.\n\n\n\nBut let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.\n\n\n\nThese are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.\n\n\n\nAnd I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\n\n\n\nShe knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming.\n\n\n\nI'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you.\n\n\n\nYou know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.\n\n\n\nI've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.\n\n\n\nI fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.\n\n\n\nThanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans.\n\n\n\nI don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.\n\n\n\nI fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills.\n\n\n\nI fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master's Degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me.\n\n\n\nI fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies.\n\n\n\nI fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles.\n\n\n\nWe're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.\n\n\n\nWe believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\n\n\n\nWe believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.\n\n\n\nI will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\n\n\n\nMy tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\n\n\n\nKeeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity.\n\n\n\nI know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away.\n\n\n\nWe will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.\n\n\n\nEducation is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.\n\n\n\nWhen a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm President, they will.\n\n\n\nMy fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.\n\n\n\nThis great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce.\n\n\n\nToday, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve.\n\n\n\nWe have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\n\n\n\nWe face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace.\n\n\n\nWhen I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.\n\n\n\nI'm running for President to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals -- to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.\n\n\n\nIn America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\n\n\n\nWe need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\n\n\n\nInstead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.\n\n\n\nWe're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit.\n\n\n\nI've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.\n\n\n\nLong ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love.\n\n\n\nOn an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me.\n\n\n\nThen I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.\n\n\n\nI was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down.\n\n\n\nA lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me.\n\n\n\nWhen they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with. Because every day they fought for me.\n\n\n\nI fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.\n\n\n\nI'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.\n\n\n\nIf you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.\n\n\n\nI'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\n\n\n\nFight for what's right for our country.\n\n\n\nFight for the ideals and character of a free people.\n\n\n\nFight for our children's future.\n\n\n\nFight for justice and opportunity for all.\n\n\n\nStand up to defend our country from its enemies.\n\n\n\nStand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.\n\n\n\nStand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\n\n\nThank you, and God Bless you."}

Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.\n\nWorking together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody\u2019s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.\n\nThe summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators\u2019 Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:\n\nWhat standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.\n\nHow to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.\n\nHow to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.\n\nHow to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.\n\nHow to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.\n\nHow to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.\n\nOf course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.\n\nNevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don\u2019t let this opportunity pass us by.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama"}

Mississippi's new voter ID law was put to its first test in Tuesday\u2019s primaries. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nNote: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.\n\nVoter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.\n\nPart of this litigation \u2014 and any rational debate about the issue generally \u2014 hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.\n\nFirst, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don\u2019t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they\u2019re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.\n\n[Here\u2019s the completely legal way to \u2018rig\u2019 an election]\n\nSecond, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud \u2026 that ID laws aren\u2019t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.\n\nThis sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you\u2019ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren\u2019t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.\n\nInstead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.\n\nI\u2019ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I\u2019ve been following reports wherever they crop up.\n\n[New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans]\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.\n\nSome of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I\u2019d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.\n\nIn just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn\u2019t include voters without ID who didn\u2019t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?\n\nCorrection: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.\n\nCredible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls\n\nNote: tracking the allegations \u2014 even those that may end up disproven \u2014 can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not \u2014 please \u2014 examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.\n\nMay 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others\u2019 names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Evan Dixon in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Evan Dixon listed as dying 11 years earlier.[6] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Alejandro Guerrero in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Alejandro Guerrero listed as dying 5 years earlier.[7] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. 2012: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2012 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney.[8] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX. (His mother, Reyna Almanza, vouched for him, and was separately convicted.)[11] Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Forrest Downie in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Forrest Downie listed as dying 3 years earlier.[12] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Scott Hagloch in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Scott Hagloch listed as dying 2 years earlier.[13] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Mar. 2008: Jack Carol Crowder III allegedly impersonated his father (Jack Carol Crowder), using his father\u2019s voter registration card at the polls in the March 2008 presidential primary election in Baytown, TX.[14] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of James E. Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, \u201caffidavit ballots\u201d) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister\u2019s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four \u201crecent\u201d voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals\u2019 deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]\n\nCredible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement\n\n(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)\n\nNov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother\u2019s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki\u2019s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver\u2019s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter\u2019s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver\u2019s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister\u2019s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver\u2019s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver\u2019s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Pe\u00f1a was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Pe\u00f1a was apparently given someone else\u2019s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Pe\u00f1a\u2019s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else\u2019s voter registration card, and claimed that \u201cthey had people that worked the election on their side.\u201d Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin\u2019s request, she signed her cousin\u2019s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to \u201cgo in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.\u201d It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown\u2019s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alism\u00e9, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver\u2019s license and a voter registration card in Alism\u00e9\u2019s name.[44]\n\n[1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.\n\n[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.\n\n[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php.\n\n[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.\n\n[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.\n\n[8] N.C.

The bill sets aside $5 billion of that to reward states, districts and schools for setting high standards and narrowing achievement gaps between poor and affluent students. The law lets Mr. Duncan decide which states deserve awards and which programs merit special financing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine moving that much money that quickly,\u201d said Margaret Spellings, Mr. Duncan\u2019s predecessor, who turned her seventh-floor office over to him last month. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s never been done before, and as much confidence as I have in Arne Duncan, there\u2019s an awesome opportunity for slippage with that much money moving through the meat grinder.\u201d\n\nMaybe Ms. Spellings is slightly jealous, since she and other secretaries stretching back decades had only small amounts of money for favored projects.\n\n\u201cTeeny, teeny,\u201d said Amy Wilkins, who as vice president at the Education Trust, a civil rights group, has studied the budgets of several of Mr. Duncan\u2019s predecessors. \u201cMargaret was looking for quarters in her pencil drawer.\u201d\n\nMr. Duncan said he understood the unusual circumstances.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be this extraordinary influx of resources,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSo people say, \u2018You\u2019re going to be the most powerful secretary ever,\u2019 but I have no interest in that. Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.\u201d\n\nMr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement \u2014 \u201cislands of excellence,\u201d he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort.\n\n\u201cI want all of us to work hard enough and smart enough to take full advantage of this, because it\u2019ll never happen again,\u201d Mr. Duncan said last month in his first speech to hundreds of civil servants at department headquarters, as the outlines of the huge stimulus package were taking shape in Congress.\n\nUrging department employees not to be deferential, he described the reception he got on his first visit to his headquarters.\n\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018Hello, Mr. Secretary-designate-nominee,\u2019 and it didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Mr. Duncan said. \u201cMy name is Arne. It\u2019s not Mr. Secretary. Please just call me Arne.\u201d That line drew a standing ovation.\n\nHe has hit it off well with Congress, too, so far. His wife, Karen, whom Mr. Duncan met in Australia, where he played professional basketball after his 1987 graduation from Harvard, accompanied him to his Senate confirmation, along with their daughter, Claire, 7, and son, Ryan, 4, who sat quietly during the hearing, reading storybooks.\n\n\u201cIf you and your wife have done such a great job with Ryan, who is so well behaved, I hope you can do that with every child in American classrooms,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said Mr. Obama had made \u201cseveral distinguished cabinet appointments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re the best,\u201d Mr. Alexander, who was education secretary under the first President Bush, said to Mr. Duncan.\n\nBut now comes the hard part.\n\nLast year the Education Department distributed about $59 billion to states, school districts and colleges, most of it along well-worn financing paths mapped out by Congress.\n\n\u201cCongress usually spends two years debating the rules for how to spend $50 million,\u201d said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy, a research organization in Washington. \u201cBut this time they\u2019re providing money without spelling out how it should be spent, so Arne Duncan and his staff are going to have to work out rules themselves in just weeks. He\u2019s going to have his hands full.\u201d\n\nCongress has stipulated some rules, of course. To receive a share of the $54 billion stabilization fund, governors must make several \u201cassurances\u201d to Mr. Duncan, intended to drive school reforms: that they are developing statewide data systems that can allow schools to track individual students\u2019 academic progress, that they are assigning experienced teachers fairly to rich and poor schools alike, and so on. Mr. Duncan has the ticklish job of ruling on whether the governors\u2019 assurances are convincing.\n\nAnd Congress has given him a $5 billion incentive fund that he can use to reward states that are raising student achievement and withhold money from states that are not. \u201cWe have states that tell the public that 90 percent of kids are meeting state standards,\u201d Mr. Duncan said, \u201cbut when we look at how they\u2019re doing on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, it\u2019s nowhere close. I\u2019m not going to reward that.

But nearly one year later, more than three million more Americans have lost their jobs, the deficit is set to hit a record shattering $1.6 trillion, and Administration reports on how many jobs were \u201csaved or created\u201d have been \u201criddled with inaccuracies and contradictions,\u201d noted USA Today.\n\n\n\nBy the metrics the Democrats themselves set, the \u201cstimulus\u201d hasn\u2019t worked \u2013 it\u2019s chock-full of wasteful government spending that\u2019s funneled money to Congressional districts that don\u2019t exist and claims of jobs \u201csaved or created\u201d were so exaggerated that the Administration quietly abandoned the metric at the end of last year.\n\n\n\nPoll after poll confirms that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the \u201cstimulus\u201d program. In fact, a CBS/New York Times poll released yesterday found that \u201c just 6 percent of Americans think it has created jobs .\u201d Any wonder that a CNN survey reported that \u201c3 of 4 Americans say much of stimulus money wasted.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo where is all the \u201cstimulus\u201d money going? Here are just a few real-world examples:\n\n\n\nreported last month that:\n\n\n\nAnd if that wasteful spending wasn\u2019t bad enough, the Associated Press reported last month that:\n\n\u201cA federal spending surge of more than $20 billion for roads and bridges in President Barack Obama\u2019s first stimulus has had no effect on local unemployment rates...An Associated Press analysis of stimulus spending found that it didn\u2019t matter if a lot of money was spent on highways or none at all: Local unemployment rates rose and fell regardless. And the stimulus spending only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry, the analysis showed....\n\n\n\n\u201cEven within the construction industry, which stood to benefit most from transportation money, the AP\u2019s analysis found there was nearly no connection between stimulus money and the number of construction workers hired or fired since Congress passed the recovery program. The effect was so small, one economist compared it to trying to move the Empire State Building by pushing against it.\u201d\n\n"}

Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\n\nBack in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n\nPhoto\n\nI didn\u2019t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone \u2014 not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 \u2014 shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what\u2019s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.\n\nSince 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion \u2014 a staggering $227.4 million on average \u2014 but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.\n\nThe taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn\u2019t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.\n\nTwelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country\u2019s finances. They\u2019ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It\u2019s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country\u2019s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.\n\nJob one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can\u2019t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.\n\nBut for those making more than $1 million \u2014 there were 236,883 such households in 2009 \u2014 I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more \u2014 there were 8,274 in 2009 \u2014 I would suggest an additional increase in rate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.

Nestor, which held that Americans have no right to receive Social Security benefits, #tcot #p2", "article": "Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. Nestor\n\nBackground to the Case:\n\n\n\nThe fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish \"rights\" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are \"an earned right.\" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.\n\n\n\nThere has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled \"RESERVATION OF POWER,\" specifically said: \"The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress.\" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.\n\n\n\nIn this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right. Flemming V. Nestor Case Name: FLEMMING V.

FROM A DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOLDING SEC. 202(N) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (68 STAT. 1083, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N)) UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE TAKES THIS DIRECT APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. SEC. 1252. THE CHALLENGED SECTION, SET FORTH IN FULL IN THE MARGIN, (FN1) PROVIDES FOR THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE, SURVIVOR, AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO, OR IN CERTAIN CASES IN RESPECT OF, AN ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WHO, AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1954 (THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THE SECTION), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251A)) ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN, IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913, AND BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A)(6)(C)(I) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. THIS BEING ONE OF THE BENEFIT TERMINATION DEPORTATION GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), APPELLEE'S BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SOON THEREAFTER, AND NOTICE OF THE TERMINATION WAS GIVEN TO HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY. (FN2) UPON HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION, APPELLEE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, PURSUANT TO SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (53 STAT. 1370, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 405(G)), TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW. (FN3) ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED FOR APPELLEE, HOLDING SEC. 202(N) UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT IN THAT IT DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT. 169 F. SUPP. 922. THE SECRETARY PROSECUTED AN APPEAL TO THIS COURT, AND, SUBJECT TO A JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION HEREINAFTER DISCUSSED, WE SET THE CASE DOWN FOR PLENARY HEARING. 360 U.S. 915. THE PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION IS WHETHER 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282 IS APPLICABLE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRED THAT THE CASE BE HEARD BELOW BEFORE THREE JUDGES, RATHER THAN BY A SINGLE JUDGE, AS IT WAS. SECTION 2282 FORBIDS THE ISSUANCE, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, OF ANY \"INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF ANY ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION ... .\" NEITHER PARTY REQUESTED A THREE-JUDGE COURT BELOW, AND IN THIS COURT BOTH PARTIES ARGUE THE INAPPLICABILITY OF SEC. 2282. IF THE PROVISION APPLIES, WE CANNOT REACH THE MERITS, BUT MUST VACATE THE JUDGMENT BELOW AND REMAND THE CASE FOR CONSIDERATION BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. SEE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION V. THE DARLINGTON, INC., 352 U.S. 977. UNDER THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT, THIS SEC. 205(G) ACTION COULD, AND DID, DRAW IN QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N). SEE, E.G., ANNISTON MFG. CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 337, 345-346. HOWEVER, THE ACTION DID NO MORE. IT DID NOT SEEK AFFIRMATIVELY TO INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF A STATUTORY SCHEME. A JUDGMENT FOR THE APPELLEE WOULD NOT PUT THE OPERATION OF A FEDERAL STATUTE UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF AN EQUITY DECREE; INDEED, APART FROM ITS EFFECT UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS, IT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESULT THAN TO REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE THINK THAT WHAT WAS SAID IN GARMENT WORKERS V. DONNELLY CO., 304 U.S. 243, WHERE THIS COURT DEALT WITH AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, IS CONTROLLING HERE: \"THE PREDECESSOR OF SEC. 2282 DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A CASE WHERE THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS IS MERELY DRAWN IN QUESTION, ALBEIT THAT QUESTION BE DECIDED, BUT ONLY FOR A CASE WHERE THERE IS AN APPLICATION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS ... . HAD CONGRESS INTENDED THE PROVISION ... , FOR THREE JUDGES AND DIRECT APPEAL, TO APPLY WHENEVER A QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS BECAME INVOLVED, CONGRESS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE USED THE FAMILIAR PHRASE 'DRAWN IN QUESTION' ... .\" ID., AT 250. WE HOLD THAT JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEREFORE REACH THE MERITS. I. WE THINK THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT.\" 169 F. SUPP., AT 934. APPELLEE'S RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT PROPERLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN OF THAT ORDER. THE GENERAL PURPOSES UNDERLYING THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WERE EXPOUNDED BY MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO IN HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 640-645. THE ISSUE HERE, HOWEVER, REQUIRES SOME INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTORY SCHEME BY WHICH THOSE PURPOSES ARE SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED. PAYMENTS UNDER THE ACT ARE BASED UPON THE WAGE EARNER'S RECORD OF EARNINGS IN EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT COVERED BY THE ACT, AND TAKE THE FORM OF OLD-AGE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS INURING TO THE WAGE EARNER (KNOWN AS THE \"PRIMARY BENEFICIARY\"), AND OF BENEFITS, INCLUDING SURVIVOR BENEFITS, PAYABLE TO NAMED DEPENDENTS (\"SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES\") OF A WAGE EARNER. BROADLY SPEAKING, ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS DEPENDS ON SATISFYING STATUTORY CONDITIONS AS TO (1) EMPLOYMENT IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT (SEE SEC. 210(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 410(A)); (2) THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF \"QUARTERS OF COVERAGE\" - I.E., THREE-MONTH PERIODS DURING WHICH NOT LESS THAN A STATED SUM WAS EARNED - THE NUMBER DEPENDING GENERALLY ON AGE (SEE SECS. 213-215, 42 U.S.C. SECS. 413-415); AND (3) ATTAINMENT OF THE RETIREMENT AGE (SEE SEC. 216(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 416(A)). SEC. 202(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(A). (FN4) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS ONCE GAINED IS PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY LOST IF THE BENEFICIARY EARNS MORE THAN A STATED ANNUAL SUM, UNLESS HE OR SHE IS AT LEAST 72 YEARS OLD. SEC. 203(B), (E), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 403(B), (E). OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE IS THE FACT THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS, AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, DO NOT IN ANY TRUE SENSE DEPEND ON CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, BUT RATHER ON THE EARNINGS RECORD OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYEES IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT, AND ON THEIR EMPLOYERS. THE TAX RATE, WHICH IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRST $4,800 OF EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCOME, IS SET AT A SCALE WHICH WILL INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, PRESUMABLY TO KEEP PACE WITH RISING BENEFIT COSTS. I.R.C. OF 1954, SECS. 3101, 3111, 3121(A). THE TAX PROCEEDS ARE PAID INTO THE TREASURY \"AS INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTIONS,\" I.R.C., SEC. 3501, AND EACH YEAR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PROCEEDS IS APPROPRIATED TO A TRUST FUND, FROM WHICH BENEFITS AND THE EXPENSES OF THE PROGRAM ARE PAID. SEC. 201, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401. IT WAS EVIDENTLY CONTEMPLATED THAT RECEIPTS WOULD GREATLY EXCEED DISBURSEMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE INCOME RETURNED TO THE TRUST FUND. THUS, PROVISION IS MADE FOR EXPECTED INCREASING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MAY BE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS A FORM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO \"SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE 'GENERAL WELFARE,'\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 640, WHEREBY PERSONS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED, AND THOSE WHO EMPLOY THEM, ARE TAXED TO PERMIT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. PLAINLY THE EXPECTATION IS THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE PRESENT PRODUCTIVE WORK FORCE WILL IN TURN BECOME BENEFICIARIES RATHER THAN SUPPORTERS OF THE PROGRAM. BUT EACH WORKER'S BENEFITS, THOUGH FLOWING FROM THE CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY WHILE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED, ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM BY TAXATION. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS BOTTOMED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING \"EARNED RIGHTS\" AND GRATUITIES.\" CF. LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, 576-577. THE \"RIGHT\" TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE \"EARNED,\" FOR THE ENTIRE SCHEME RESTS ON THE LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT THAT THOSE WHO IN THEIR PRODUCTIVE YEARS WERE FUNCTIONING MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMY MAY JUSTLY CALL UPON THAT ECONOMY, IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM \"THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 641. BUT THE PRACTICAL EFFECTUATION OF THAT JUDGMENT HAS OF NECESSITY CALLED FORTH A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED STATUTORY STRUCTURE. INTEGRATED TREATMENT OF THE MANIFOLD SPECIFIC PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM DEMANDS MORE THAN A GENERALIZATION. THAT PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION INTO THE INDEFINITE FUTURE, AND ITS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS REST ON PREDICTIONS AS TO EXPECTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH MUST INEVITABLY PROVE LESS THAN WHOLLY ACCURATE, AND ON JUDGMENTS AND PREFERENCES AS TO THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF THE NATION'S RESOURCES WHICH EVOLVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS WILL OF NECESSITY IN SOME DEGREE MODIFY. TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS\" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS. SEE WOLLENBERG, VESTED RIGHTS IN SOCIAL-SECURITY BENEFITS, 37 ORE. L. REV. 299, 359. IT WAS DOUBTLESS OUT OF AN AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR SUCH FLEXIBILITY THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL ACT, AND HAS SINCE RETAINED, A CLAUSE EXPRESSLY RESERVING TO IT \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. THAT PROVISION MAKES EXPRESS WHAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. SEE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, HEARINGS BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 83D CONG., 1ST SESS., PP. 920 921. IT WAS PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION THAT SEC. 202(N) WAS ENACTED. WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT A PERSON COVERED BY THE ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF \"ACCRUED\" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. II. THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT CONGRESS MAY EXERCISE ITS POWER TO MODIFY THE STATUTORY SCHEME FREE OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT. THE INTEREST OF A COVERED EMPLOYEE UNDER THE ACT IS OF SUFFICIENT SUBSTANCE TO FALL WITHIN THE PROTECTION FROM ARBITRARY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AFFORDED BY THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN JUDGING THE PERMISSIBILITY OF THE CUT-OFF PROVISIONS OF SEC. 202(N) FROM THIS STANDPOINT, IT IS NOT WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONGRESSIONAL JUDGMENT EXPRESSED IN THAT SECTION IS SOUND OR EQUITABLE, OR WHETHER IT COMPORTS WELL OR ILL WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT. \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 644. PARTICULARLY WHEN WE DEAL WITH A WITHHOLDING OF A NONCONTRACTUAL BENEFIT UNDER A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO INTERPOSE A BAR ONLY IF THE STATUTE MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION. SUCH IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S RESIDENCE ABROAD - IN THE CASE OF A DEPORTEE, A PRESUMABLY PERMANENT RESIDENCE - CAN BE OF OBVIOUS RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY. ONE BENEFIT WHICH MAY BE THOUGHT TO ACCRUE TO THE ECONOMY FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS THE INCREASED OVER-ALL NATIONAL PURCHASING POWER RESULTING FROM TAXATION OF PRODUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMY TO PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DESTITUTE OR NEARLY SO, AND WHO WOULD GENERALLY SPEND A COMPARATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST AS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO ONE RESIDING ABROAD. FOR THESE PURPOSES, IT IS, OF COURSE, CONSTITUTIONALLY IRRELEVANT WHETHER THIS REASONING IN FACT UNDERLAY THE LEGISLATIVE DECISION, AS IT IS IRRELEVANT THAT THE IN LOGIC APPLY. (FN5) SEE UNITED STATES V. PETRILLO, 332 U.S. 1, 8-9; STEWARD MACHINE CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 548, 584-585; CF. CARMICHAEL V. SOUTHERN COAL CO., 301 U.S. 495, 510-513. NOR, APART FROM THIS, CAN IT BE DEEMED IRRATIONAL FOR CONGRESS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE PUBLIC PURSE SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF THOSE DEPORTED ON THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE. WE NEED GO NO FURTHER TO FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. III.

MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277; AND THAT THE PUNISHMENT EXACTED IS IMPOSED FOR PAST CONDUCT NOT UNLAWFUL WHEN ENGAGED IN, THEREBY VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS, SEE EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333. (FN7) ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH OF THESE CONTENTIONS IS THE VALIDITY OF CHARACTERIZING AS \"PUNISHMENT\" IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N). IN DETERMINING WHETHER LEGISLATION WHICH BASES A DISQUALIFICATION ON THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN PAST EVENT IMPOSES A PUNISHMENT, THE COURT HAS SOUGHT TO DISCERN THE OBJECTS ON WHICH THE ENACTMENT IN QUESTION WAS FOCUSED. WHERE THE SOURCE OF LEGISLATIVE CONCERN CAN BE THOUGHT TO BE THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED, THE DISQUALIFICATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BEAR HARSHLY UPON ONE AFFECTED. THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE WHERE THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED. IN THE EARLIEST CASE ON WHICH APPELLEE RELIES, A CLERGYMAN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BARRING FROM THAT PROFESSION - AND FROM MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OFFICES - ALL WHO WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THEY HAD NEVER MANIFESTED ANY SYMPATHY OR SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CONFEDERACY. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA. THE COURT THUS DESCRIBED THE AIMS OF THE CHALLENGED ENACTMENT: \"THE OATH COULD NOT ... HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AS A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER PARTIES WERE QUALIFIED OR NOT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CALLINGS OR THE TRUSTS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CHARGED. IT WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING. IT WAS EXACTED, NOT FROM ANY NOTION THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESIGNATED INDICATED UNFITNESS FOR THE CALLINGS, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESERVED PUNISHMENT ... .\" ID., AT 320. ONLY THE OTHER DAY THE GOVERNING INQUIRY WAS STATED, IN AN OPINION JOINED BY FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COURT, IN THESE TERMS: \"THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE WHERE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON AN INDIVIDUAL FOR PRIOR CONDUCT, IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE AIM WAS TO PUNISH THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR PAST ACTIVITY, OR WHETHER THE RESTRICTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMES ABOUT AS A RELEVANT INCIDENT TO A REGULATION OF A PRESENT SITUATION, SUCH AS THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PROFESSION.\" DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, 363 U.S. 144, 160 (PLURALITY OPINION). IN EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT STRUCK DOWN AN OATH - SIMILAR IN CONTENT TO THAT INVOLVED IN CUMMINGS - REQUIRED OF ATTORNEYS SEEKING TO PRACTICE BEFORE ANY FEDERAL COURT, AS ALSO IN CUMMINGS, THE FINDING OF PUNITIVE INTENT DREW HEAVILY ON THE COURT'S FIRST-HAND ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EVENTS AND THE MOOD OF THE THEN RECENT CIVIL WAR, AND \"THE FIERCE PASSIONS WHICH THAT STRUGGLE AROUSED.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. (FN8) SIMILARLY, IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT INVALIDATED, AS A BILL OF ATTAINDER, A STATUTE FORBIDDING - SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS - THE FURTHER PAYMENT OF THE SALARIES OF THREE NAMED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THE DETERMINATION THAT A PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN IMPOSED RESTED IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY WHICH THE COURT WAS AT PAINS TO SPELL OUT IN DETAIL. SEE 328 U.S., AT 308-312. MOST RECENTLY, IN TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, WHICH HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL A STATUTE PROVIDING FOR THE EXPATRIATION OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN SENTENCED BY A COURT-MARTIAL TO DISMISSAL OR DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE FOR WARTIME DESERTION, THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT CHARACTERIZED THE STATUTE AS PUNITIVE. HOWEVER, NO SINGLE OPINION COMMANDED THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY. THE PLURALITY OPINION RESTED ITS DETERMINATION, AT LEAST IN PART, ON ITS INABILITY TO DISCERN ANY ALTERNATIVE PURPOSE WHICH THE STATUTE COULD BE THOUGHT TO SERVE. ID., AT 97. THE CONCURRING OPINION FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT. ID., AT 107-109. IT IS THUS APPARENT THAT, THOUGH THE GOVERNING CRITERION MAY BE READILY STATED, EACH CASE HAS TURNED ON ITS OWN HIGHLY PARTICULARIZED CONTEXT. WHERE NO PERSUASIVE SHOWING OF A PURPOSE \"TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING,\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 320, HAS BEEN MADE, THE COURT HAS NOT HAMPERED LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN ITS SPHERE OF CONCERN, DESPITE THE OFTEN-SEVERE EFFECTS SUCH REGULATION HAS HAD ON THE PERSONS SUBJECT TO IT. (FN9) THUS, DEPORTATION HAS BEEN HELD TO BE NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT AN EXERCISE OF THE PLENARY POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS ARE TO BE PERMITTED TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. FONG YUE TING V. UNITED STATES, 149 U.S. 698, 730; SEE GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 530-531. SIMILARLY, THE SETTING BY A STATE OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, AND THEIR MODIFICATION FROM TIME TO TIME, IS AN INCIDENT OF THE STATE'S POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS, AND ITS DECISION TO BAR FROM PRACTICE PERSONS WHO COMMIT OR HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY IS TAKEN AS EVIDENCING AN INTENT TO EXERCISE THAT REGULATORY POWER, AND NOT A PURPOSE TO ADD TO THE PUNISHMENT OF EX FELONS. HAWKER V. NEW YORK, 170 U.S. 189. SEE DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, SUPRA (REGULATION OF CRIME ON THE WATERFRONT THROUGH DISQUALIFICATION OF EX-FELONS FROM HOLDING UNION OFFICE). CF. HELVERING V. MITCHELL, 303 U.S. 391, 397-401, HOLDING THAT, WITH RESPECT TO DEFICIENCIES DUE TO FRAUD, A 50 PERCENT ADDITION TO THE TAX IMPOSED WAS NOT PUNISHMENT SO AS TO PREVENT, UPON PRINCIPLES OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY, ITS ASSESSMENT AGAINST ONE ACQUITTED OF TAX EVASION. TURNING, THEN, TO THE PARTICULAR STATUTORY PROVISION BEFORE US, APPELLEE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CONTEND THAT THE LANGUAGE AND STRUCTURE OF SEC. 202(N), OR THE NATURE OF THE DEPRIVATION, REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE A PUNITIVE DESIGN. CF. WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, SUPRA (IMPRISONMENT, AT HARD LABOR UP TO ONE YEAR, OF PERSON FOUND TO BE UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY). HERE THE SANCTION IS THE MERE DENIAL OF A NONCONTRACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT. NO AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT IS IMPOSED, AND CERTAINLY NOTHING APPROACHING THE \"INFAMOUS PUNISHMENT\" OF IMPRISONMENT, AS IN WONG WING, ON WHICH GREAT RELIANCE IS MISTAKENLY PLACED. MOREOVER, FOR REASONS ALREADY GIVEN (ANTE, PP. 611-612), IT CANNOT BE SAID, AS WAS SAID OF THE STATUTE IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 319; SEE DENT V. WEST VIRGINIA, 129 U.S. 114, 126, THAT THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEPORTEES FROM RECEIPT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHILE THEY ARE NOT LAWFULLY IN THIS COUNTRY BEARS NO RATIONAL CONNECTION TO THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATION OF WHICH IT IS A PART, AND MUST WITHOUT MORE THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING A CONGRESSIONAL DESIRE TO PUNISH. APPELLEE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE HISTORY AND SCOPE OF SEC. 202(N) PROVE THAT NO SUCH POSTULATED PURPOSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO HAVE MOTIVATED THE LEGISLATURE, AND THAT THEY PERSUASIVELY SHOW THAT A PUNITIVE PURPOSE IN FACT LAY BEHIND THE STATUTE. WE DO NOT AGREE. WE OBSERVE INITIALLY THAT ONLY THE CLEAREST PROOF COULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE ON SUCH A GROUND. JUDICIAL INQUIRIES INTO CONGRESSIONAL MOTIVES ARE AT BEST A HAZARDOUS MATTER, AND WHEN THAT INQUIRY SEEKS TO GO BEHIND OBJECTIVE MANIFESTATIONS IT BECOMES A DUBIOUS AFFAIR INDEED. MOREOVER, THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WITH WHICH THIS ENACTMENT, LIKE ANY OTHER, COMES TO US FORBIDS US LIGHTLY TO CHOOSE THAT READING OF THE STATUTE'S SETTING WHICH WILL INVALIDATE IT OVER THAT WHICH WILL SAVE IT. \"IT IS NOT ON SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TO BE PRONOUNCED TO HAVE TRANSCENDED ITS POWERS, AND ITS ACTS TO BE CONSIDERED AS VOID.\" FLETCHER V. PECK, 6 CRANCH 87, 128. OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE PROVISION ORIGINATED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. H.R. 9366, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., SEC. 108. THE DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE COMMITTEE REPORT, H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., PP. 5, 25, 77, DOES NOT EXPRESS THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, IT DOES SAY THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE \"DEPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY ... .\" ID., AT 25. IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTE RESULTING FROM ITS APPLICATION TO DEPORTATION UNDER THE 14 NAMED PARAGRAPHS OF SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. ID., AT 77. (FN10) THE SENATE COMMITTEE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE STATED REASON THAT IT HAD \"NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SUFFICIENT STUDY TO ALL THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROVISION, WHICH INVOLVES TERMINATION OF BENEFIT RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRIBUTORY PROGRAM OF OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE ... .\" S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 23; SEE ALSO ID., AT 76. HOWEVER, IN CONFERENCE, THE PROPOSAL WAS RESTORED IN MODIFIED FORM, (FN11) AND AS MODIFIED WAS ENACTED AS SEC. 202(N). SEE H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 2679, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 18. APPELLEE ARGUES THAT THIS HISTORY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONGRESS WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S DEPORTATION - WHICH IT IS CLAIMED ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY THIS LEGISLATION AS BEING PURSUANT TO A POLICY RELEVANT TO REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM - BUT THAT IT SOUGHT TO REACH CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION, THUS EVIDENCING A PUNITIVE INTENT. (FN12) IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE MEAGRE HISTORY THE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT WHICH, UNDER PRINCIPLES ALREADY DISCUSSED, IS REQUIRED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT OF THIS KIND MAY BE STRUCK DOWN. EVEN WERE THAT HISTORY TO BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING CONGRESS' CONCERN WITH THE GROUNDS, RATHER THAN THE FACT, OF DEPORTATION, WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS, STANDING ALONE, WOULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH A PUNITIVE PURPOSE. THIS WOULD STILL BE A FAR CRY FROM THE SITUATIONS INVOLVED IN SUCH CASES AS CUMMINGS, WONG WING, AND GARLAND (SEE ANTE, P. 617), AND FROM THAT IN LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE LEGISLATION WAS ON ITS FACE AIMED AT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD, HOWEVER, FALLS SHORT OF ANY PERSUASIVE SHOWING THAT CONGRESS WAS IN FACT CONCERNED ALONE WITH THE GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION. TO BE SURE CONGRESS DID NOT APPLY THE TERMINATION PROVISION TO ALL DEPORTEES. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT NEITHER DID IT REST THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ACT. THE FACT OF DEPORTATION ITSELF REMAINED AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR LOSS OF BENEFITS, AND EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY WERE SAVED FROM DEPORTATION ONLY THROUGH DISCRETIONARY SUSPENSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER SEC. 244 OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (66 STAT. 214, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1254), SEC. 202(N) WOULD NOT REACH HIM. MOREOVER, THE GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION REFERRED TO IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT EMBRACE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE DEPORTED, AS IS EVIDENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE FOUR OMITTED GROUNDS, SUMMARIZED IN THE MARGIN. (FN13) INFERENCES DRAWN FROM THE OMISSION OF THOSE GROUNDS CANNOT ESTABLISH, TO THE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY REQUIRED, THAT CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS WHOLLY WITH THE ACTS LEADING TO DEPORTATION, AND NOT WITH THE FACT OF DEPORTATION. (FN14) TO HOLD OTHERWISE WOULD BE TO REST ON THE \"SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE\" AGAINST WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL WARNED. FLETCHER V. PECK, SUPRA, AT 128. THE SAME ANSWER MUST BE MADE TO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE FAILURE OF CONGRESS TO APPLY SEC. 202(N) TO BENEFICIARIES VOLUNTARILY RESIDING ABROAD. BUT CF. SEC. 202(T), ANTE, NOTE 5. CONGRESS MAY HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER SUCH PERSONS; OR IT MAY HAVE THOUGHT THEIR NUMBER TOO SLIGHT, OR THE PERMANENCE OF THEIR VOLUNTARY RESIDENCE ABROAD TOO UNCERTAIN, TO WARRANT APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THEM, WITH ITS ATTENDANT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN, WE CANNOT WITH CONFIDENCE REJECT ALL THOSE ALTERNATIVES WHICH IMAGINATIVENESS CAN BRING TO MIND, SAVE THAT ONE WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE INVALIDATION OF THE STATUTE. REVERSED.

ON THE AUTHORITY OF CUMMINGS AND GARLAND, THE AMENDMENT WAS INVALIDATED. Footnote 9- AS PRIOR DECISIONS MAKE CLEAR, COMPARE EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WITH HAWKER V.

Footnote 11- FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE HOUSE VERSION TERMINATION OF BENEFITS OF A DEPORTEE WOULD ALSO HAVE TERMINATED BENEFITS PAID TO SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES BASED ON THE EARNING RECORDS OF THE DEPORTEE. THE CONFERENCE PROPOSAL LIMITED THIS EFFECT TO SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES WHO WERE NONRESIDENT ALIENS. SEE NOTE 2, ANTE. Footnote 12- APPELLEE ALSO RELIES ON THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 108 AND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS, SOME OF WHICH WERE ENACTED AND SOME OF WHICH WERE NOT. THIS ARGUMENT IS TOO CONJECTURAL TO WARRANT DISCUSSION. IN ADDITION, RELIANCE IS PLACED ON A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE BY APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR IN OFFICE, OPPOSING THE ENACTMENT OF WHAT IS NOW SEC. 202(U) OF THE ACT, 70 STAT. 838, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(U), ON THE GROUND THAT THE SECTION WAS \"IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES\" OF THE PROGRAM. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, HEARINGS BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS., P. 1319. THE SECRETARY WENT ON TO SAY THAT \"PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (OF WHICH SEC. 202(N) IS ONE) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SECRETARY DID NOT SPEAK OF SEC. 202(N) AS A PENALTY, AS HE DID OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 202(U). THE LATTER PROVISION IS CONCEDEDLY PENAL, AND APPLIES ONLY PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF A COURT IN A CRIMINAL CASE. Footnote 13- THEY ARE: (1) PERSONS INSTITUTIONALIZED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY BECAUSE OF \"MENTAL DISEASE, DEFECT, OR DEFICIENCY\" NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION (SEC. 241(A)(3)); (2) PERSONS BECOMING A PUBLIC CHARGE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FROM CAUSES NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION SEC. 241(A)(8)); (3) PERSONS ADMITTED AS NONIMMIGRANTS (SEE SEC. 101(A)(15), 66 STAT. 167, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1101(A)(15)) WHO FAIL TO MAINTAIN, OR COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS OF, SUCH STATUS (SEC. 241(A)(9)); (4) PERSONS KNOWINGLY AND FOR GAIN INDUCING OR AIDING, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, ANY OTHER ALIEN TO ENTER OR ATTEMPT TO ENTER UNLAWFULLY (SEC. 241(A)(13)). Footnote 14- WERE WE TO ENGAGE IN SPECULATION, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CONJECTURE THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE BEEN LED TO EXCLUDE THESE FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION OUT OF COMPASSIONATE OR DE MINIMIS CONSIDERATIONS. MR. JUSTICE BLACK, DISSENTING. FOR THE REASONS STATED HERE AND IN THE DISSENTS OF MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS AND MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN I AGREE WITH THE DISTRICT COURT THAT THE UNITED STATES IS DEPRIVING APPELLEE, EPHRAM NESTOR, OF HIS STATUTORY RIGHT TO OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN VIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. NESTOR CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND LIVED HERE CONTINUOUSLY FOR 43 YEARS, UNTIL JULY 1956. HE WAS THEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST FROM 1933 TO 1939. AT THAT TIME MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AS SUCH WAS NOT ILLEGAL AND WAS NOT EVEN A STATUTORY GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 NESTOR AND HIS EMPLOYERS MADE REGULAR PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT, 26 U.S.C. SECS. 3101-3125. THESE FUNDS WENT TO A SPECIAL FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND UNDER 49 STAT. 622, 53 STAT. 1362, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401, IN RETURN FOR WHICH NESTOR, LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS, EXPECTED TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS WHEN HE REACHED THE STATUTORY AGE. IN 1954, 15 YEARS AFTER NESTOR HAD LAST BEEN A COMMUNIST, AND 18 YEARS AFTER HE BEGAN TO MAKE PAYMENTS INTO THE OLD-AGE SECURITY FUND, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT ANY PERSON WHO HAD BEEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF PAST COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP UNDER 66 STAT. 205, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251(A)(6)(C) SHOULD BE WHOLLY CUT OFF FROM ANY BENEFITS OF THE FUND TO WHICH HE HAD CONTRIBUTED UNDER THE LAW. 68 STAT. 1083, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N). AFTER THE GOVERNMENT DEPORTED NESTOR IN 1956 IT NOTIFIED HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT HE WAS CUT OFF AND NO FURTHER PAYMENTS WOULD BE MADE TO HIM. THIS ACTION, IT SEEMS TO ME, TAKES NESTOR'S INSURANCE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION AND IN VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. MOREOVER, IT IMPOSES AN EX POST FACTO LAW AND BILL OF ATTAINDER BY STAMPING HIM, WITHOUT A COURT TRIAL, AS UNWORTHY TO RECEIVE THAT FOR WHICH HE HAS PAID AND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED TO PAY HIM. THE FACT THAT THE COURT IS SUSTAINING THIS ACTION INDICATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GO THESE DAYS TO OVERLOOK VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION PERPETRATED AGAINST ANYONE WHO HAS EVER EVEN INNOCENTLY BELONGED TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY. I. IN LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, THIS COURT UNANIMOUSLY HELD THAT CONGRESS WAS WITHOUT POWER TO REPUDIATE AND ABROGATE IN WHOLE OR IN PART ITS PROMISES TO PAY AMOUNTS CLAIMED BY SOLDIERS UNDER THE WAR RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 1917, SECS. 400-405, 40 STAT. 409. THIS COURT HELD THAT SUCH A REPUDIATION WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT THAT \"NO PERSON SHALL BE ... DEPRIVED OF LIFE, LIBERTY, OR PROPERTY, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW; NOR SHALL PRIVATE PROPERTY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE, WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION.\" THE COURT TODAY PUTS THE LYNCH CASE ASIDE ON THE GROUND THAT \"IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING 'EARNED RIGHTS' AND 'GRATUITIES.'\" FROM THIS SOUND PREMISE THE COURT GOES ON TO SAY THAT WHILE \"THE 'RIGHT' TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE 'EARNED,'\" YET THE GOVERNMENT'S INSURANCE SCHEME NOW BEFORE US RESTS NOT ON THE IDEA OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND EARNING SOMETHING, BUT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT THEY MAY \"JUSTLY CALL\" UPON THE GOVERNMENT \"IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM 'THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.'\" THESE ARE NICE WORDS BUT THEY CANNOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THEY SIMPLY TELL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS INSURANCE FUND THAT DESPITE THEIR OWN AND THEIR EMPLOYERS' PAYMENTS THE GOVERNMENT, IN PAYING THE BENEFICIARIES OUT OF THE FUND, IS MERELY GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING AND CAN STOP DOING SO WHEN IT PLEASES. THIS, IN MY JUDGMENT, REVEALS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY HAD IN PASSING THAT LAW. IT WAS THEN GENERALLY AGREED, AS IT IS TODAY, THAT IT IS NOT DESIRABLE THAT AGED PEOPLE THINK OF THE GOVERNMENT AS GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. AN EXCELLENT STATEMENT OF THIS VIEW, QUOTED BY MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS IN ANOTHER CONNECTION, WAS MADE BY SENATOR GEORGE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WAS PASSED, AND ONE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PHILOSOPHY THAT BROUGHT IT ABOUT: \"IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. THE PEOPLE COVERED BY THIS ACT ARE NOW ABLE TO RELY WITH COMPLETE ASSURANCE ON THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO CONTRIBUTE REGULARLY TO THIS FUND WHENEVER EACH CONTRIBUTION FALLS DUE. I BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RELY WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE ON GETTING THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE PAID FOR AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED, WHEN THEIR DISABILITY OR AGE MAKES THEIR INSURANCE PAYABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LAW. THE COURT DID NOT PERMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO BREAK ITS PLIGHTED FAITH WITH THE SOLDIERS IN THE LYNCH CASE; IT SAID THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE SUCH GOVERNMENTAL CONDUCT. I WOULD SAY PRECISELY THE SAME THING HERE. THE COURT CONSOLES THOSE WHOSE INSURANCE IS TAKEN AWAY TODAY, AND OTHERS WHO MAY SUFFER THE SAME FATE IN THE FUTURE, BY SAYING THAT A DECISION REQUIRING THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM TO KEEP FAITH \"WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS.\" PEOPLE WHO PAY PREMIUMS FOR INSURANCE USUALLY THINK THEY ARE PAYING FOR INSURANCE, NOT FOR \"FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS.\" I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ANY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY IN AMERICA WOULD BE PERMITTED TO REPUDIATE ITS MATURED CONTRACTS WITH ITS POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE REGULARLY PAID ALL THEIR PREMIUMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE COMPANY. IT IS TRUE, AS THE COURT SAYS, THAT THE ORIGINAL ACT CONTAINED A CLAUSE, STILL IN FORCE, THAT EXPRESSLY RESERVES TO CONGRESS \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. CONGRESS, OF COURSE PROPERLY RETAINED THAT POWER. IT COULD REPEAL THE ACT SO AS TO CEASE TO OPERATE ITS OLD-AGE INSURANCE ACTIVITIES FOR THE FUTURE. THIS MEANS THAT IT COULD STOP COVERING NEW PEOPLE, AND EVEN STOP INCREASING ITS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS OLD CONTRIBUTORS. BUT THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM DISAPPOINTING THE JUST EXPECTATIONS OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMPELLED THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYERS TO PAY ITS TREASURY. THERE IS NOTHING \"CONCEPTUALISTIC\" ABOUT SAYING, AS THIS COURT DID IN LYNCH, THAT SUCH A TAKING AS THIS THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS. II. IN PART II OF ITS OPINION, THE COURT THROWS OUT A LINE OF HOPE BY ITS SUGGESTION THAT IF CONGRESS IN THE FUTURE CUTS OFF SOME OTHER GROUP FROM THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE BOUGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT, THIS COURT MIGHT POSSIBLY HOLD THAT THE FUTURE HYPOTHETICAL ACT VIOLATES THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN DOING SO IT READS DUE PROCESS AS AFFORDING ONLY MINIMAL PROTECTION, AND UNDER THIS READING IT WILL PROTECT ALL FUTURE GROUPS FROM DESTRUCTION OF THEIR RIGHTS ONLY IF CONGRESS \"MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION.\" THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE SO DEFINED PROVIDES LITTLE PROTECTION INDEED COMPARED WITH THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE CONSTITUTION SUCH AS ITS PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TAKING PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR A PUBLIC USE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION, PASSING EX POST FACTO LAWS, AND IMPOSING BILLS OF ATTAINDER. I CANNOT AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE IS PROPERLY INTERPRETED WHEN IT IS USED TO SUBORDINATE AND DILUTE THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND WHEN \"DUE PROCESS\" ITSELF BECOMES SO WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON THIS COURT'S IDEA OF WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND \"RATIONAL.\" SEE LEVINE V. UNITED STATES, 362 U.S. 610, 620 (DISSENTING OPINION); ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, 332 U.S. 46, 89-92 (DISSENTING OPINION); ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA, 342 U.S. 165, 174 (CONCURRING OPINION). ONE REASON FOR MY BELIEF IN THIS RESPECT IS THAT I AGREE WITH WHAT IS SAID IN THE COURT'S QUOTATION FROM HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 644: \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" AND YET THE COURT'S ASSUMPTION OF ITS POWER TO HOLD ACTS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THE COURT THINKS THEY ARE ARBITRARY AND IRRATIONAL CAN BE NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A JUDICIAL FORAY INTO THE FIELD OF GOVERNMENTAL POLICY. BY THE USE OF THIS DUE PROCESS FORMULA THE COURT DOES NOT, AS ITS PROPONENTS FREQUENTLY PROCLAIM, ABSTAIN FROM INTERFERING WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL POLICY. IT ACTIVELY ENTERS THAT FIELD WITH NO STANDARDS EXCEPT ITS OWN CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND WHAT IS \"RATIONAL.\" AND THIS ELASTIC FORMULA GIVES THE COURT A FURTHER POWER, THAT OF HOLDING LEGISLATIVE ACTS CONSTITUTIONAL ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE NEITHER ARBITRARY NOR IRRATIONAL, EVEN THOUGH THE ACTS VIOLATE SPECIFIC BILL OF RIGHTS SAFEGUARDS. SEE MY DISSENT IN ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, SUPRA. WHETHER THIS ACT HAD \"RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION\" WAS, IN MY JUDGMENT, FOR CONGRESS; WHETHER IT VIOLATES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL IS FOR US TO DETERMINE, UNLESS WE ARE BY CIRCUMLOCUTION TO ABDICATE THE POWER THAT THIS COURT HAS BEEN HELD TO HAVE EVER SINCE MARBURY V. MADISON, 1 CRANCH 137. III. THE COURT IN PART III OF ITS OPINION HOLDS THAT THE 1954 ACT IS NOT AN EX POST FACTO LAW OR BILL OR ATTAINDER EVEN THOUGH IT CREATES A CLASS OF DEPORTEES WHO CANNOT COLLECT THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE ONCE COMMUNISTS AT A TIME WHEN SIMPLY BEING A COMMUNIST WAS NOT ILLEGAL. THE COURT ALSO PUTS GREAT EMPHASIS ON ITS BELIEF THAT THE ACT HERE IS NOT PUNISHMENT. ALTHOUGH NOT BELIEVING THAT THE PARTICULAR LABEL \"PUNISHMENT\" IS OF DECISIVE IMPORTANCE, I THINK THE ACT DOES IMPOSE PUNISHMENT EVEN IN A CLASSIC SENSE. THE BASIC REASON FOR NESTOR'S LOSS OF HIS INSURANCE PAYMENTS IS THAT HE WAS ONCE A COMMUNIST. THIS MAN, NOW 69 YEARS OLD, HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHERE HE HAS LIVED FOR 43 YEARS TO A LAND WHERE HE IS PRACTICALLY A STRANGER, UNDER AN ACT AUTHORIZING HIS DEPORTATION MANY YEARS AFTER HIS COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP. CF. GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 532, 533 (DISSENTING OPINIONS). NOW A SIMILAR EX POST FACTO LAW DEPRIVES HIM OF HIS INSURANCE, WHICH, WHILE PETTY AND INSIGNIFICANT IN AMOUNT TO THIS GREAT GOVERNMENT, MAY WELL BE THIS EXILE'S DAILY BREAD, FOR THE SAME REASON AND IN ACCORD WITH THE GENERAL FASHION OF THE DAY - THAT IS, TO PUNISH IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ANYONE WHO EVER MADE THE MISTAKE OF BEING A COMMUNIST IN THIS COUNTRY OR WHO IS SUPPOSED EVER TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ANYONE WHO MADE THAT MISTAKE. SEE, E.G., BARENBLATT V. UNITED STATES, 360 U.S. 109, AND UPHAUS V. WYMAN, 360 U.S. 72. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, 315-316, WE SAID: \" ... LEGISLATIVE ACTS, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FORM, THAT APPLY EITHER TO NAMED INDIVIDUALS OR TO EASILY ASCERTAINABLE MEMBERS OF A GROUP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INFLICT PUNISHMENT ON THEM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL ARE BILLS OF ATTAINDER PROHIBITED BY THE CONSTITUTION.\" FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF OUR HOLDINGS IN THAT CASE, IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, AND IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, WOULD, IN MY JUDGMENT, REQUIRE US TO HOLD THAT THE 1954 ACT IS A BILL OF ATTAINDER. IT IS A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT AIMED AT AN EASILY ASCERTAINABLE GROUP; IT IS CERTAINLY PUNISHMENT IN ANY NORMAL SENSE OF THE WORD TO TAKE AWAY FROM ANY PERSON THE BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE SYSTEM INTO WHICH HE AND HIS EMPLOYER HAVE PAID THEIR MONEYS FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES; AND IT DOES ALL THIS WITHOUT A TRIAL ACCORDING TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW. IT IS TRUE THAT THE LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND COURT OPINIONS WERE NOT UNANIMOUS, BUT THEY NONETHELESS REPRESENT POSITIVE PRECEDENTS ON HIGHLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WHICH SHOULD NOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY WITH COBWEBBERY REFINEMENTS. IF THE COURT IS GOING TO OVERRULE THESE CASES IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AND ADOPT THE VIEWS OF PREVIOUS DISSENTERS, I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE DONE CLEARLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY. A BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY OF THIS ACT, IN MY JUDGMENT, IS THAT IT IS A PART OF A PATTERN OF LAWS ALL OF WHICH VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT OUT OF FEAR THAT THIS COUNTRY IS IN GRAVE DANGER IF IT LETS A HANDFUL OF COMMUNIST FANATICS OR SOME OTHER EXTREMIST GROUP MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSS THEIR IDEAS. THIS FEAR, I THINK, IS BASELESS. IT REFLECTS A LACK OF FAITH IN THE STURDY PATRIOTISM OF OUR PEOPLE AND DOES NOT GIVE TO THE WORLD A TRUE PICTURE OF OUR ABIDING STRENGTH. IT IS AN UNWORTHY FEAR IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS A BILL OF RIGHTS CONTAINING PROVISONS FOR FAIR TRIALS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS AND RELIGION, AND OTHER SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO KEEP MEN FREE. I REPEAT ONCE MORE THAT I THINK THIS NATION'S GREATEST SECURITY LIES, NOT IN TRUSTING TO A MOMENTARY MAJORITY OF THIS COURT'S VIEW AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OF WHAT IS \"PATENTLY ARBITRARY,\" BUT IN WHOLEHEARTED DEVOTION TO AND OBSERVANCE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS. SEE WIEMAN V. UPDEGRAFF, 344 U.S. 183, 192 (CONCURRING OPINION). I WOULD AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT WHICH HELD THAT NESTOR IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO COLLECT HIS INSURANCE. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING. APPELLEE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND WAS EMPLOYED, SO AS TO BE COVERED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 - A PERIOD OF 19 YEARS. HE BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT AND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955 AND WAS AWARDED $55.60 PER MONTH. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. PURSUANT TO A LAW, ENACTED SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, HE WAS THEREUPON DENIED PAYMENT OF FURTHER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. THIS 1954 LAW SEEMS TO ME TO BE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER, WHICH ART. I, SEC. 9 OF THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS CONGRESS FROM ENACTING. A BILL OF ATTAINDER IS A LEGISLATIVE ACT WHICH INFLICTS PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, 323. IN THE OLD DAYS PUNISHMENT WAS METED OUT TO A CREDITOR OR RIVAL OR ENEMY BY SENDING HIM TO THE GALLOWS. BUT AS RECENTLY STATED BY IRVING BRANT: (FN1) \" ... BY SMITING A MAN DAY AFTER DAY WITH SLANDEROUS WORDS, BY TAKING AWAY HIS OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A LIVING, YOU CAN DRAIN THE BLOOD FROM HIS VEINS WITHOUT EVEN SCRATCHING HIS SKIN. \"TODAY'S BILL OF ATTAINDER IS BROADER THAN THE CLASSIC FORM, AND NOT SO TALL AND SHARP. THERE IS MENTAL IN PLACE OF PHYSICAL TORTURE, AND CONFISCATION OF TOMMORROW'S BREAD AND BUTTER INSTEAD OF YESTERDAY'S LAND AND GOLD. WHAT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR IS THAT HATE, FEAR AND PREJUDICE PLAY THE SAME ROLE TODAY, IN THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AMERICA THAT THEY DID IN ENGLAND WHEN A FRENZIED MOB OF LORDS, JUDGES, BISHOPS AND SHOEMAKERS TURNED THE TITUS OATES BLACKLIST INTO A HANGMAN'S RECORD. HATE, JEALOUSY AND SPITE CONTINUE TO FILL THE LEGISLATIVE ATTAINDER LISTS JUST AS THEY DID IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT OF EX-KING JAMES.\" BILLS OF ATTAINDER, WHEN THEY IMPOSED PUNISHMENT LESS THAN DEATH, WERE BILLS OF PAINS AND PENALTIES AND EQUALLY BEYOND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 323. PUNISHMENT IN THE SENSE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER INCLUDES THE \"DEPRIVATION OR SUSPENSION OF POLITICAL OR CIVIL RIGHTS.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. IN THAT CASE IT WAS BARRING A PRIEST FROM PRACTICING HIS PROFESSION. IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, IT WAS EXCLUDING A MAN FROM PRACTICING LAW IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, IT WAS CUTTING OFF EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION AND BARRING THEM PERMANENTLY FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE. CUTTING OFF A PERSON'S LIVELIHOOD BY DENYING HIM ACCRUED SOCIAL BENEFITS - PART OF HIS PROPERTY INTERESTS - IS NO LESS A PUNISHMENT. HERE, AS IN THE OTHER CASES CITED, THE PENALTY EXACTED HAS ONE OF THE CLASSIC PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT (FN2) - \"TO REPRIMAND THE WRONGDOER TO DETER OTHERS.\" TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 96. SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS ARE NOT GRATUITIES. THEY ARE PRODUCTS OF A CONTRIBUTORY SYSTEM, THE FUNDS BEING RAISED BY PAYMENT FROM EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE, OR IN CASE OF SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS, BY THE INDIVIDUAL ALONE. SEE SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD V. NIEROTKO, 327 U.S. 358, 364. THE FUNDS ARE PLACED IN THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401(A); AND ONLY THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND ARE ENTITLED TO ITS BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS BEING RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS MADE. SEE STARK, SOCIAL SECURITY: ITS IMPORTANCE TO LAWYERS, 43 A.B.A.J. 319, 321 (1957). AS THE LATE SENATOR GEORGE, LONG CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, SAID: \"THERE HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE YEARS A FEELING BOTH IN AND OUT OF CONGRESS THAT THE CONTRIBUTORY SOCIAL INSURANCE PRINCIPLE FITS OUR TIMES - THAT IT SERVES A VITAL NEED THAT CANNOT BE AS WELL SERVED OTHERWISE. IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS HAVE RIGHTLY COME TO BE REGARDED AS BASIC FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE HAZARDS OF OLD AGE AND DISABILITY. AS STATED IN A RECENT HOUSE REPORT: \"THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE SYSTEM IS THE BASIC PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR AMERICA'S FAMILIES AGAINST THE LOSS OF EARNED INCOME UPON THE RETIREMENT OR DEATH OF THE FAMILY PROVIDER. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS RELATED TO EARNED INCOME AND SUCH BENEFITS ARE PAID FOR BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS WORKING IN COVERED OCCUPATIONS.\" H.R. REP. NO. 1189, 84TH CONG., 1ST SESS. 2. CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE THAT ONLY PEOPLE RESIDENT HERE COULD GET SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. YET BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE REJECTED ANY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS. SEE H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 24-25; S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 23. CONGRESS CONCEDEDLY MIGHT AMEND THE PROGRAM TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS. BUT MAY IT TAKE AWAY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FROM ONE PERSON OR FROM A GROUP OF PERSONS FOR VINDICTIVE REASONS? COULD CONGRESS ON DEPORTING AN ALIEN FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST CONFISCATE HIS HOME, APPROPRIATE HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, AND THUS SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY PENNILESS? I THINK NOT. ANY SUCH ACT WOULD BE A BILL OF ATTAINDER. THE DIFFERENCE, AS I SEE IT, BETWEEN THAT CASE AND THIS IS ONE MERELY OF DEGREE. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, MADE UP IN PART OF THIS ALIEN'S OWN EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN FROM HIM BECAUSE HE ONCE WAS A COMMUNIST. THE VIEW THAT SEC. 202(N), WITH WHICH WE NOW DEAL, IMPOSES A PENALTY WAS TAKEN BY SECRETARY FOLSOM, APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR, WHEN OPPOSING ENLARGEMENT OF THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE TO BE DENIED BENEFITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY, E.G., THOSE CONVICTED OF TREASON AND SEDITION. HE SAID: \"BECAUSE THE DEPRIVATION OF BENEFITS AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDMENT IS IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES AND PROVISIONS OF THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE PROGRAM, THE AMENDMENT MAY WELL SERVE AS A PRECEDENT FOR EXTENSION OF SIMILAR PROVISIONS TO OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND TO OTHER CRIMES WHICH, WHILE PERHAPS DIFFERENT IN DEGREE, ARE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH IN PRINCIPLE. \"THE PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (FN3) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" HEARINGS, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS. 1319. THE COMMITTEE REPORTS, THOUGH MEAGRE, SUPPORT SECRETARY FOLSOM IN THAT CHARACTERIZATION OF SEC. 202(N). THE HOUSE REPORT TERSELY STATED THAT TERMINATION OF THE BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE DEPORTED \"BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.\" H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 25. THE AIM AND PURPOSE ARE CLEAR - TO TAKE AWAY FROM A PERSON BY LEGISLATIVE FIAT PROPERTY WHICH HE HAS ACCUMULATED BECAUSE HE HAS ACTED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR EMBRACED A CERTAIN IDEOLOGY. THAT IS A MODERN VERSION OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER - AS PLAIN, AS DIRECT, AS EFFECTIVE AS THOSE WHICH RELIGIOUS PASSIONS ONCE LOOSED IN ENGLAND AND WHICH LATER WERE EMPLOYED AGAINST THE TORIES HERE. (FN4) I WOULD AFFIRM THIS JUDGMENT. FOOTNOTES Footnote 1- ADDRESS ENTITLED BILLS OF ATTAINDER IN 1787 AND TODAY. COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW DINNER 1954, PUBLISHED IN 1959 BY THE EMERGENCY CIVIL LIBERTIES COMMITTEE, UNDER THE TITLE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND BILLS OF ATTAINDER. Footnote 2- THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE IDEA OF PUNISHMENT BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER WAS STATED AS FOLLOWS BY IRVING BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, 9-10: \"IN 1794 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH EXISTS TODAY. SUPPORTERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD ORGANIZED THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES - BLATANTLY ADOPTING THAT SUBVERSIVE TITLE. THEN THE WHISKY REBELLION EXPLODED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES WERE BLAMED. A MOTION CENSURING THE SOCIETIES WAS INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. \"THERE, IN 1794, YOU HAD THE BASIC DIVISION IN AMERICAN THOUGHT - ON ONE SIDE THE DOCTRINE OF POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR EVERYBODY, WITH COLLECTIVE SECURITY RESTING ON THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE FOR SELF GOVERNMENT; ON THE OTHER SIDE THE DOCTRINE THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED AND POLITICAL LIBERTY MUST BE RESTRAINED. \"JAMES MADISON CHALLENGED THIS LATTER DOCTRINE. THE INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF CONGRESS OVER PERSONS, HE CONTENDED, WAS LIMITED TO INQUIRY INTO THE CONDUCT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 'OPINIONS,' HE SAID, 'ARE NOT THE SUBJECTS OF LEGISLATION.' START CRITICIZING PEOPLE FOR ABUSE OF THEIR RESERVED RIGHTS, AND THE CENSURE MIGHT EXTEND TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON THE PEOPLE THUS CONDEMNED? SAID MADISON: \"'IT IS IN VAIN TO SAY THAT THIS INDISCRIMINATE CENSURE IS NO PUNISHMENT ... . IS NOT THIS PROPOSITION, IF VOTED, A BILL OF ATTAINDER?' \"MADISON WON HIS FIGHT, NOT BECAUSE HE CALLED THE RESOLUTION A BILL OF ATTAINDER, BUT BECAUSE IT ATTAINTED TOO MANY MEN WHO WERE GOING TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THE DEFINITION, HOWEVER, WAS THERE - A BILL OF ATTAINDER - AND THE DEFINITION WAS GIVEN BY THE FOREMOST AMERICAN AUTHORITY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND ORDER UNDERLYING OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.\" Footnote 3- THE THREE EXCEPTIONS REFERRED TO WERE (1) SEC. 202(N); (2) ACT OF SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, 68 STAT. 1142, 5 U.S.C. SECS. 2281-2288; (3) REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 20 CFR SEC. 403.409 - DENYING DEPENDENT'S BENEFITS TO A PERSON FOUND GUILTY OF FELONIOUS HOMICIDE OF THE INSURED WORKER. Footnote 4- BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, STATES AT P. 9: \"WHAT WERE THE FRAMERS AIMING AT WHEN THEY FORBADE BILLS OF ATTAINDER? THEY WERE, OF COURSE, GUARDING AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS PASSIONS THAT DISGRACED CHRISTIANITY IN EUROPE. BUT AMERICAN BILLS OF ATTAINDER, JUST BEFORE 1787, WERE TYPICALLY USED BY REVOLUTIONARY ASSEMBLIES TO RID THE STATES OF BRITISH LOYALISTS. BY A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE, IT WAS USUALLY THE TORY WITH A GOOD FARM WHO WAS SENT INTO EXILE, AND ALL TOO OFTEN IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO WANTED THAT FARM WHO INDUCED THE LEGISLATURE TO ATTAINT HIM. PATRIOTISM COULD SERVE AS A CLOAK FOR GREED AS EASILY AS RELIGION DID IN THAT IRISH PARLIAMENT OF JAMES THE SECOND. \"BUT CONSIDER A CASE IN WHICH NOTHING COULD BE SAID AGAINST THE MOTIVE. DURING THE REVOLUTION, GOVERNOR PATRICK HENRY INDUCED THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BILL OF ATTAINDER CONDEMNING JOSIAH PHILLIPS TO DEATH. HE WAS A TRAITOR, A MURDERER, A PIRATE AND AN OUTLAW. WHEN RATIFICATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION CAME BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION, HENRY INVEIGHED AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT CONTAINED NO BILL OF RIGHTS. EDMUND RANDOLPH TAUNTED HIM WITH HIS SPONSORSHIP OF THE PHILLIPS BILL OF ATTAINDER. HENRY THEN MADE THE BLUNDER OF DEFENDING IT. THE BILL WAS WARRANTED, HE SAID, BECAUSE PHILLIPS WAS NO SOCRATES. THAT SHOCKING DEFENSE OF ARBITRARY CONDEMNATION MAY HAVE PRODUCED THE SMALL MARGIN BY WHICH THE CONSTITUTION WAS RATIFIED.\" MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS JOIN, DISSENTING. WHEN NESTOR QUIT THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 1939 HIS PAST MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT A GROUND FOR HIS DEPORTATION. KESSLER V. STRECKER, 307 U.S. 22. IT WAS NOT UNTIL A YEAR LATER THAT PAST MEMBERSHIP WAS MADE A SPECIFIC GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. (FN1) THIS PAST MEMBERSHIP HAS COST NESTOR DEAR. IT BROUGHT HIM EXPULSION FROM THE COUNTRY AFTER 43 YEARS' RESIDENCE - MOST OF HIS LIFE. NOW MORE IS EXACTED FROM HIM, FOR AFTER HE HAD BEGUN TO RECEIVE BENEFITS IN 1955 - HAVING WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT THE REQUIRED TIME AND REACHED AGE 65 - AND MIGHT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING THEM THE REST OF HIS LIFE, THE BENEFITS WERE STOPPED PURSUANT TO SEC. 202(N) OF THE AMENDED SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. (FN2) HIS PREDICAMENT IS VERY REAL - AN AGING MAN DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS WITH WHICH TO LIVE AFTER BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY AND EXILED TO LIVE AMONG STRANGERS IN A LAND HE QUIT 47 YEARS AGO. THE COMMON SENSE OF IT IS THAT HE HAS BEEN PUNISHED SEVERELY FOR HIS PAST CONDUCT. EVEN THE 1950 STATUTE DEPORTING ALIENS FOR PAST MEMBERSHIP RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS IN THIS COURT WHETHER THE PROHIBITION AGAINST EX POST FACTO LAWS WAS VIOLATED. IN GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 531, WE SAID \"SINCE THE INTRINSIC CONSEQUENCES OF DEPORTATION ARE SO CLOSE TO PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME, IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE SAID ALSO THAT THE EX POST FACTO CLAUSE, EVEN THOUGH APPLICABLE ONLY TO PUNITIVE LEGISLATION, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO DEPORTATION.\" HOWEVER, PRECEDENTS WHICH TREAT DEPORTATION NOT AS PUNISHMENT, BUT AS A PERMISSIBLE EXERCISE OF CONGRESSIONAL POWER TO ENACT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS MAY COME TO AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY, GOVERNED THE DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, THE COURT CANNOT REST A DECISION THAT SEC. 202(N) DOES NOT IMPOSE PUNISHMENT ON CONGRESS' POWER TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION. IT ESCAPES THE COMMON-SENSE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED PUNISHMENT BY FINDING THE REQUISITE RATIONAL NEXUS TO A GRANTED POWER IN THE SUPPOSED FURTHERANCE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM \"ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO 'SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE \"GENERAL WELFARE.\"'\" I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COURT TO DENY THAT BUT FOR THAT CONNECTION, SEC. 202(N) WOULD IMPOSE PUNISHMENT AND NOT ONLY OFFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS BUT ALSO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES AGAINST IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. THE COURT'S TEST OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N) IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN UNDERLYING THE STATUTE WAS TO REGULATE \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED\" OR WHETHER THE STATUTE \"IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" IT REJECTS THE INFERENCE THAT THE STATUTE IS \"AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED\" BY RELYING UPON THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY. THIS PRESUMPTION MIGHT BE A BASIS FOR SUSTAINING THE STATUTE IF IN FACT THERE WERE TWO OPPOSING INFERENCES WHICH COULD REASONABLY BE DRAWN FROM THE LEGISLATION, ONE THAT IT IMPOSES PUNISHMENT AND THE OTHER THAT IT IS PURPOSED TO FURTHER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE COURT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT LIMIT THE PRESUMPTION TO THAT USE. RATHER THE PRESUMPTION BECOMES A COMPLETE SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY SUPPORTABLE FINDING OF A RATIONAL CONNECTION OF SEC. 202(N) WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. FOR ME IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO STATE THE TEST AND HOLD THAT THE PRESUMPTION ALONE SATISFIES IT. I FIND IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE ACT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS GROUND FOR THE INFERENCE OF A CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. ONLY AFTER THIS INQUIRY WOULD I CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF THE PRESUMPTION. THE COURT SEEMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATUTE BEARS HARSHLY UPON THE INDIVIDUAL DISQUALIFIED, BUT STATES THAT THIS IS PERMISSIBLE WHEN A STATUTE IS ENACTED AS A REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITY. BUT SURELY THE HARSHNESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES IS ITSELF A RELEVANT CONSIDERATION TO THE INQUIRY INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL PURPOSE. (FN3) CF. TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 110 (CONCURRING OPINION). IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STATUTE ITSELF SHOWS THAT THE SOLE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN WAS WITH \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" CONGRESS DID NOT DISQUALIFY FOR BENEFITS ALL BENEFICIARIES RESIDING ABROAD OR EVEN ALL DEPENDENTS RESIDING ABROAD WHO ARE ALIENS. IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE I MIGHT AGREE THAT CONGRESS' CONCERN WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" AND NOT WITH THE \"PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE SCALES WOULD THEN BE TIPPED TOWARD THE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS DESIRED TO LIMIT BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WOULD BE AIDED BY EXPENDITURE OF BENEFITS HERE. INDEED A PROPOSAL ALONG THOSE LINES WAS SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS IN 1954, AT THE SAME TIME SEC. 202(N) WAS PROPOSED, (FN4) AND IT WAS REJECTED. (FN5) PERHAPS, THE COURT'S CONCLUSION THAT REGULATION OF \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WOULD BE A FAIR APPRAISAL OF THE STATUTE IF CONGRESS HAD TERMINATED THE BENEFITS OF ALL ALIEN BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE DEPORTED. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS DID. THE 18 GROUNDS FOR WHICH ALIENS MAY BE DEPORTED. (FN6) H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 25, 77, CITED BY THE COURT, DESCRIBES SEC. 202(N) AS INCLUDING PERSONS WHO WERE DEPORTED \"BECAUSE OF UNLAWFUL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.\" THE ACTS AS NARCOTIC ADDICTION OR PROSTITUTION. THE COMMON ELEMENT OF THE 14 GROUNDS IS THAT THE ALIEN HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SOME BLAMEWORTHY CONDUCT. IN OTHER WORDS CONGRESS WORKED ITS WILL ONLY ON ALIENS DEPORTED FOR CONDUCT DISPLEASING TO THE LAWMAKERS. THIS IS PLAINLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE REMAINING FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION, THOSE WHICH DO NOT RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF BENEFITS. (FN7) TWO OF THOSE FOUR GROUNDS COVER PERSONS WHO BECOME PUBLIC CHARGES WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FOR REASONS WHICH PREDATED THE ENTRY. A THIRD GROUND COVERS THE ALIEN WHO FAILS TO MAINTAIN HIS NONIMMIGRANT STATUS. THE FOURTH GROUND REACHES THE ALIEN WHO, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, AIDS OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES CLEARLY HAVE NOT, BY MODERN STANDARDS, ENGAGED IN CONDUCT WORTHY OF CENSURE. THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON FOR THEIR EXCLUSION FROM SEC. 202(N) WAS AN UNARTICULATED FEELING OF CONGRESS THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE \"OTHER COUNTRY TO DEPORT SUCH DESTITUTE PERSONS WITHOUT LETTING THEM RETAIN THEIR MODICUM OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS\" APPEARS AT BEST FANCIFUL, ESPECIALLY SINCE, BY HYPOTHESIS, THEY ARE DEPORTABLE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THEIR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES EXISTED PRIOR TO ENTRY. THE EXCLUSION FROM THE OPERATION OF SEC. 202(N) OF ALIENS DEPORTED FOR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN NONIMMIGRANT STATUS RATIONALLY CAN BE EXPLAINED, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE STATUTE, ONLY AS EVIDENCING THAT CONGRESS CONSIDERED THAT CONDUCT LESS BLAMEWORTHY. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT SUCH PERSONS WOULD WORK SUFFICIENT TIME IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT BE THE REASON FOR THIS EXCLUSION. FOR FREQUENTLY THE VERY ACT WHICH EVENTUALLY RESULTS IN THE DEPORTATION OF PERSONS ON THAT GROUND IS THE SECURING OF PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. FINALLY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE THE CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS TO ALIENS WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR AIDING OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, EXCEPT UPON THE GROUND THAT CONGRESS FELT THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS LESS REPREHENSIBLE. AGAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON MIGHT BE CONGRESS' BELIEF THAT THESE ALIENS WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT MUST BE REJECTED. FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY WOULD BE AMPLE TIME WITHIN WHICH TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT AND QUALIFY. MOREOVER THE SAME FIVE-YEAR LIMITATION APPLIES TO SEVERAL OF THE 14 GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION FOR WHICH ALIENS ARE CUT OFF FROM BENEFITS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT WOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO THEM IF THAT IN FACT WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL REASON. THIS APPRAISAL OF THE DISTINCTIONS DRAWN BY CONGRESS BETWEEN VARIOUS KINDS OF CONDUCT IMPELS THE CONCLUSION, BEYOND PERADVENTURE THAT THE DISTINCTIONS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IF THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS WAS TO STRIKE AT \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE COURT INVEIGHS AGAINST INVALIDATING A STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATON AND VAGUE CONJECTURE.\" RATHER I THINK THE COURT HAS STRAINED TO SUSTAIN THE STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE,\" IN HOLDING THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED.\" TODAY'S DECISION SANCTIONS THE USE OF THE SPENDING POWER NOT TO FURTHER THE LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM BUT TO INFLICT HURT UPON THOSE WHO BY THEIR CONDUCT HAVE INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF CONGRESS. THE FRAMERS ORDAINED THAT EVEN THE WORST OF MEN SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR PAST ACTS OR FOR ANY CONDUCT WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION. TODAY'S DECISION IS TO ME A REGRETFUL RETREAT FROM LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND."}

GREGORY: Good morning. Protests grew in Madison , Wisconsin , Saturday after days of demonstrations there by pro- labor supporters. The standoff started two weeks ago after Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker proposed a budget -balancing bill that would severely limit the rights of most public workers to collectively bargain. The bill would also require them to pay for 12.6 percent of the total cost of their healthcare premiums, and contribute almost 6 percent of their pay toward their pension benefits. Walker 's proposal is an attempt to close the $137 million deficit in this year's state budget , a shortfall that is projected to grow to $3.6 billion in the next two years. And here with us now from Madison , the man in the middle of all this, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker . Governor, welcome to MEET THE PRESS .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Good morning. Good to be with you , David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So that context is important because there's collective bargaining , which you'd like to limit, and there are those -- the specific contributions that you asked the unions. They said they would do that, they would meet those demands. So the question that comes up again and again is, if you want to deal with the budget and the deficit, why not take yes for an answer?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, because we've seen that actions speak louder than words. For us to balance the $3.6 billion deficit we have -- but not only now, but to ensure we can continue to do that in the future so our kids don't inherit these same dire consequences -- we've got to have assurances. And over the past two weeks , even after they made those promises, we've seen local union after local union rush to their school boards , their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care . And, in fact, in one case in Janesville , they actually were pushing through a pay increase. Actions do speak louder than words.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, you could have extended the bill -- you could have extended the bill to those local government agencies. You chose not to.\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, that's just the opposite. I was a local government official for eight years. This bill precisely helps local governments , and it's effective once it passes. In fact, we're, we're facing a $3.6 billion deficit. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're going to have to cut more than a billion dollars from our schools and local governments . You know, in New York and California , where there are Democrats for governors, they're doing that. The difference here is, with this budget repair bill, we give those schools and local governments more -- almost a billion and a half dollars worth of savings. So the savings they get from our budget repair bill exceed the amount...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But...\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...that they're cut from the next state budget .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, but let, let me be clear . If the unions, who, who it seems to me have been clear in saying that they would agree to those extra contributions, if they did that, and you say you're concerned about the budget shortfall, why not accept that?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But what I -- my point is they can't because they -- the two people that suggested it are statewide union leaders. There are a thousand-plus municipalities, there's four -- more than 424 school districts , there's 72 counties. I know -- I used to be a county executive for eight years -- I know that collective bargaining has to be done in every jurisdiction. They can't guarantee that. And the actions of those local unions over the past two weeks show that. If they were serious about it, they would have offered up contracts that, that paid something for health care and something more for pensions. But they're not. The, the reality is, even beyond the five and the 12, collective bargaining does have a cost. In Wisconsin , a great example of that is, we have, in many of our school districts , a requirement through collective bargaining contracts that they have to buy their health insurance from a company that's owned by our state teacher's union , WA Trust . Because of that, it costs them up to $68 -- $68 million more than if they could just buy it from the state employee healthcare plan. Those are real costs about putting real money in the classroom instead of into these collective bargaining agreements. And, for me, at the, at the county level...\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's one -- Governor, let me just stop you.\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...I tried to avoid layoffs.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what, what's wrong with collective bargaining ? Let's be clear . So unions organize public employees. They're able to bargain, not just about wages, but also about health benefits and pension benefits. What you're trying to do is say no, you can just collectively bargain when it comes to how much you make, but not those other benefits.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: What's so wrong with that, collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today. Under Barack Obama , he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for, for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has. And, in fact, most federal employees...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But I asked you a more specific question, which is what's wrong with collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, for us it's, it's about the fact that, again, as a local official, I can tell you personally time and time again because of collective bargaining when we had tough budgets in the past, when I was at the county presiding as the CO there, I tried to do modest changes of pension, I tried to do modest changes in health care . In fact, one year I literally tried to do a 35- hour work week to try and avoid massive layoffs and furloughs, and the union said, \"Forget it.\" Embodied, emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements, they said, \"Go ahead. Literally lay off 400 or 500 people.\" And to me, laying off people in this economy is just completely unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me ask you about...\n\nGOV. WALKER: If we do not get these changes and the Senate Democrats don't come back, we're going to be forced to make up the savings in layoffs. And that, to me, is just unacceptable.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I don't mean to -- we have a satellite delay here, it sometimes gets us to bump up against each other. But I want to focus on inconsistencies in some of your argument. You do have exemptions here. You've said, \"We're going to pass this bill, but if you're a cop or a firefighter you don't have to make those extra contributions and you can still collectively bargain.\" You seem to be picking winners and losers. Cops and firefighters don't have to join this. Are they more important than a teacher who spends six hours a day with children in Wisconsin ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, this is not a value judgment about employees, but it is ultimately about preserving public safety . We saw two weeks ago, when this debate first started, teachers here in Madison walked off the job for three days. Now, that was an inconvenience for a lot of parents. I know I've got two public -- kids in public school . Anytime you have a disturbance like that, it's an inconvenience. But that, contrasted to the fact that even if there was one jurisdiction across the state where firefighters or police officers weren't on the job in full force , I can't afford to have a fire or crime committed where there's a gap in service. And it ultimately just boils down to public safety .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, but again, if you're talking about austerity, and you want to deal with this budget deficit , doesn't there have to be a sense of shared sacrifice, that everybody gets hurt?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, there is. I'm a -- well, I'm affecting my family about this, the legislature , my Cabinet -- in fact, as elected officials , we'll pay a higher dollar amount, a higher percentage because of these changes, to show that we're that serious about it. Now, the, the statewide firefighters union president has come out and said they'd take the five and the 12. I would suggest to every mayor out there that they take them up on that. But in terms of making that change, I can't afford to have a gap when it comes to public safety . I think that's the one thing universally, Republican and Democrat alike, liberal or conservative, that people know that we cannot have a gap in, and that's why we made that change in the bill.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You were the subject of a crank call , a liberal blogger who was trying to draw you into, to a conversation about all of this.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and you had a serious conversation, not knowing who you were talking to. And you talked about Ronald Reagan ...\n\nGOV. WALKER: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...and him taking on the unions and the air traffic controllers . And you talked about putting this moment in some kind of context. This is part of what you said.\n\nGOV. WALKER: In Wisconsin 's history -- little did I know how big it would be nationally -- in Wisconsin 's history I said, \"This is our moment , this is our time to change the course of history.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Change the course of history.\" And this is where critics say, you know, this governor is really more of an ideologue than someone who wants to solve a serious problem . You're going farther than other Republicans who have taken on pension and healthcare costs to really go active -- after collective bargaining . And by your own admission, you're saying, \"Well, there's some areas where we just can't afford that level of austerity.\" But if you're serious about austerity, doesn't it have to be a situation where everybody gets affected?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, in the end, the reason I made that comment, I do believe that this is our moment in Wisconsin 's history. It's one of those where, for year after year after year, not just the last governor, but governors before, legislatures before, have kicked the can. They've taken one-time fixes to push the budget problems off into the future . We can't do that. We're broke. Like nearly every other state across the country , we're broke. And it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state and said, \"Here's our problem . Here's the solution,\" and acted on it. Because, if we don't, we fail to make a commitment to the future . Our children will face even more dire consequences than what we face today.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, Governor, if you, if you say you're broke...\n\nGOV. WALKER: So I, I make no apology for the fact that this is an important moment in time.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, if you're really serious about the state being broke, you have a deal that you could take to get the contributions you need to solve the problem at hand. Why not separate that out from your views about collective bargaining ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: But, but, David , my point is repeatedly, as a former local government official, I know that collective bargaining has a cost, and when I'm cutting out more a billion dollars from aid to local governments in this next two-year budget , I need to do what no other governor's doing across the country . They're all cutting. All but a handful are cutting. The difference is where we want to be unique in Wisconsin is we have to give those local governments the tools. And it goes beyond the 5 and the 12 percent. And as I mentioned repeatedly, I don't think we can take that 5 and 12 percent to the bank...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Are you needless dividing your state ?\n\nGOV. WALKER: ...because unions have shown us the last two weeks that, that they're not going to do it. No. I think, in the end, the best way for us to move forward is for those 14 state senators -- the state assembly did their job, Democrats in the assembly stood up, made their argument, made their case, did what they were elected to do. The assembly passed it. It is now at a point where we want to move forward. It's real simple. Those 14 state senators need to come back and do what they were elected to do, come back here -- they don't have to vote for it, they don't have to support it, but they need to come back and do their job. And when we do, I have every belief that -- the first four, five weeks we're in office, we passed an aggressive agenda that showed that Wisconsin is open for business. Many of those same senate Democrats voted with me on those measures. We can get back to that if they just come back and do the job they were elected to do.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And if they don't -- if they don't, Governor, how does this end?\n\nGOV. WALKER: Well, I'm an optimist. I'm an eternal optimist. As much as I understand there's passion and that's -- you know, in America , that's great. We can have passion and be civil about it. But, in the end, I believe that those -- at least some of those state senators will come back. If we fail to pass this bill by Tuesday, we lose $165 million worth of savings. If we continue down that path, we start seeing layoffs. I know that was one of the most difficult decisions I ever had to make when I was a county official was considering layoffs. I would go to almost any ends to avoid that. My hope is at least one of those 14 state senators feels the same way.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, final question here, I want to clarify something. In the course of this prank, this crank call that you got.\n\nGOV. WALKER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It was suggested by someone who was a liberal blogger that you might think about planting troublemakers into the crowd. And you said quote, \"We thought about that.\" Is that right? You really thought about trying to bust up physically these protests?\n\nGOV. WALKER: No, we thought , as the call continues and I've said repeatedly, we, we rejected that. But we have people all the time who contact us for and against this bill, and you can imagine people with all sorts of ideas and suggestions, and we look at everything that's out there. But the bottom line is, we rejected that because we have had a civil discourse. We've had, you know, a week ago, 70,000 people, we had more than that yesterday, and yet we haven't had problems here. We haven't had disturbances. We've just had very passionate protesters for and against this bill, and that's OK. That's a very Midwestern thing. But we're not going to allow anybody to come in from outside of this state and try and disrupt this debate . They can inform it, but we're not going to allow them to disrupt this debate and take the focus off the real issue here. And the issue is, the people in Wisconsin , particularly those 14 state senators , need to come home and have the debate here in the state Capitol .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Governor Walker , we will leave it there. Thank you very much .\n\nGOV. WALKER: Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And we'll have much more on this debate coming up in our political roundtable where we will be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka . But first, to discuss the other big story this week, the unrest in the Middle East and the violence in Libya by the regime of Moammar Gadhafi . We want to bring in the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , John McCain , who has been traveling in the Middle East this week, including stops in Tunisia , Lebanon , and Jordan . And he joins us this morning from the very busy Cairo . Senator McCain , welcome.\n\nSEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): Thank you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask you first about Libya and events that are moving very quickly, including the U.S. response. The president has made it clear that he wants Gadhafi to go. His ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , speaking after a vote in the Security Council in favor of sanctions against Libya , imposing an arms embargo, urging member countries to freeze assets of the Gadhafi family. And this is what Ambassador Rice said during that debate .\n\nDR. SUSAN RICE: When a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator, the question is how is that achieved?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with that statement, but I'd also like to point out that we could impose and could have imposed a no-fly zone. They would've stopped flying if that had been imposed. They're using air power and helicopters to continue these massacres. We should recognize a provisional government somewhere in eastern Libya , perhaps Benghazi . We should make it clear that we will provide assistance to that provisional government . And finally, we should make it absolutely clear that anyone who continues or is in engaged in these kinds of barbarous acts are going to find themselves on trial in a war crimes tribunal. We've got to really get tough.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, and by get tough, if you talk about a no-fly zone, would you stop short there? I mean, you're, you're certainly raising the specter of some kind of military intervention on the part of the U.S. and its allies to stop Gadhafi to force him to go.\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, I think that providing the so-called provisional government , and there will be one, with the equipment and material that they could use, the no-fly zone, I think would be a very strong signal. I'm not ready to use ground forces or further intervention than that. Look, Gadhafi 's days are numbered. The question is, how many? And how many people are going to be massacred before he leaves one way or the other? I think those measures that I just mentioned could hasten his demise.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask you about Egypt . We have an image of you earlier in the day in Tahrir Square where there are still protesters. The critical question is building -- the building blocks of a democratic government there. How is that going?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's going along. We met with some of the young opposition leaders, these real heroes. I was in awe to be in their company about what needs to happen. There are still significant divisions, but I think they are headed in the right direction. I think there are questions about how soon to have an election , whether to have a presidential election before the parliamentary elections. But I believe that there's every good chance they can succeed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , you're in the region. We're watching what could be called an Arab spring, an historic movement. It's also a game-changing movement for the United States and our interests there. It's my understanding the president has ordered a complete review of Middle East strategy. I know that our defense leaders have also called for instant contingency planning . As you survey the area, how do we reassess both emergencies there and our interests there?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that this winds of change are going to be confined to blowing just in the Arab world and the Maghreb . I think it's going to be all over the world , to wit what's happening in China and in other countries around the world. Second of all, the return to our fundamentals. And that is that all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights . Respect democracy , further it. Recognize that the longer there's a dictatorship, the bigger the explosion is going to be once that people become dissatisfied enough. Recognize that, that we have to assist these countries, and it is in our national interest to do so. And the economy is a vital and the most important permanent part of any successful transition to democracy and freedom. And, frankly, we should've done more in the past. I think we should all admit that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But what about contingency planning ? Are there contingencies that may arise now that are particularly worrisome to you?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I think it's not clear where this revolution goes in, in all of these countries, and every country is very different from each other. I think we should understand that Iran can take advantage of this unsettling situations in these countries. We should be standing up for democracy in Iran . We should be backing their protesters with our moral support , which we didn't in 2009 .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask to get your reaction about something that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said this week about U.S. intervention into the Middle East and into Asia . This is what he said at West Point on Friday.\n\nMR. ROBERT GATES: In my opinion, any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa , should have his head examined, as General McArthur so delicately put it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: How do you respond to that, Senator ?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: I have the highest regard for Secretary Gates . I think he's one of the finest secretaries of Defense in the history of our country and a great patriot. I think there are times, however, and I'm sure he would say this, where it does require U.S. military intervention. Afghanistan was the genesis of 9/11, as you know. We had to stamp out the situation -- get the situation there under control so that it would not continue to be a base for attacks on the United States and our allies. But I also understand the implications of the needs of a new kind of warfare to counter this radical Islamic extremism wherever it rears its head, particularly in those continents that he referred to.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Finally, Senator McCain , I just wanted to get your reaction to something that came out of Rolling Stone magazine that I'm sure you're aware of this week. Here was a picture with you in Kabul with Lieutenant General William Caldwell , and this is the piece by Rolling\n\nStone featuring him. It says this: \" The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in psychological operations to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned. And when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.\" As you know, General Petraeus is now investigating this. What happened?\n\nSEN. McCAIN: Well, you know, that's been tried on me in the past, David . I don't know what's happened. I do know that the -- General Caldwell is a great leader and has done a great job in leading the Afghan army . I also know that these briefers are briefed, \"You know, Senator\n\nX is interested in the following: A, B, C, D and E.\" And, and that, and that I think is perfectly legitimate. Now, if it went any further than that, I don't know. General Petraeus will make a full investigation. General Caldwell has steadfastly denied it, but I don't see how it could have affected my positions in any way. And so we'll see what happens. But I've, I'm -- put me down as skeptical.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Senator McCain , we will leave it there. Thank you very much and safe travels. And coming up next, as a government shutdown looms, budget battles front and center in the Capitol and in statehouses across the country . Ground zero for it all this week? Wisconsin . What is at stake there? What will it mean for the rights of workers ? And how will it all impact the 2012 race for the White House . Our political roundtable weighs in. We'll be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka ; Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour ; the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Emanuel Cleaver ; MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell ; and The Wall Street Journal 's Kim Strassel .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, what will the budget battles taking place across the country mean for the race for the White House in 2012 . Our roundtable weighs in. It's up next after this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back now with our political roundtable . The president of the AFL - CIO , Richard Trumka ; the Republican governor of Mississippi , former RNC chairman, Haley Barbour ; chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , Missouri congressman, Democrat Emanuel Cleaver ; editorial board member and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Kim Strassel ; and the host of MSNBC 's \" The Last Word ,\" Lawrence O'Donnell , who spent a long time on Capitol Hill in the early '90s, including several years as the chief of staff to the Senate finance committee , so he's seen some of these fights before. Welcome to all of you. Mr. Trumka , welcome to the program. You heard Governor Walker . This is an important moment for unions, and as he says it, for taxpayers. How do you respond to what he says?\n\nMR. RICHARD TRUMKA: Well, first of all, this isn't about the budget crisis . Let's look at how this -- his arguments migrated. First he said it was -- the budget crisis was caused because workers were paid too much in Wisconsin . We now have studies that show they're not overpaid, they're underpaid. In fact, people with a degree in Wisconsin get 25 percent less than their private sector things. Then he said it was about the pension. Now we find out that his pension plan , unlike a lot in the country , is almost fully funded. The assets match the liabilities. And then the employees said, or the members out there said, his workers said, \"We'll accept your cuts.\" And he said, \"No. We won't accept your accepting our cuts.\" And the most outrageous thing that he did, and he talked about this, was he's now saying to them, \"You either have to accept a loss of your rights or I'm going to lay you off.\" Now, no person should have to face the right of their loss of their job or the loss of their rights. I know Governor Barbour would never say to his employees, his people down there, \"You either have to give up your rights or you have to give up your job.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me, let me follow up on one point. A lot of people who are following this may be confused but certainly have questions about the role of public sector unions. And there does something that seem, seem to be distorted. You raise a lot of money from public employees. That goes, goes to finance campaigns to try to get somebody in office that you can do business with. And ultimately you're supporting someone, in some cases, that you're ultimately negotiating with. They also know that political employees, rather public employees are politically active because they're organized by the unions. And so they make concessions on things like pensions, on health care , knowing that the promises don't come due to well down the road. Isn't this the cycle that we've gotten into that public unions have to take some responsibility for?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, public employees do take responsibility for it. And those governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can actually work out problems . They -- we can solve them. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. He's saying, \"I won't talk to you. I'll talk to all my, my big contributors.\" He talked to the Koch brothers, he thought . \"But I won't talk to employees.\" Look, the five countries -- or the five states in this country that prohibit collective bargaining by state employees have a collective debt right now of $220 billion. This isn't about employees. This is about the economy .\n\nMR. GREGORY: So...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: What we need to do is create jobs, and that's what we should be doing.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. And we'll get to that.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Working together.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Governor, Governor Barbour , this is the question that I posed at the beginning of the program. Is this, is this an ideologue? Is this just about ideology? Is it about union busting ? Or is it about really getting serious about shared sacrifice?\n\nGOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS): Well, it's about budgets. It is about the fact that Wisconsin , like many states , is broke. And the idea is, \"OK, let's make a very narrow agreement over wages and, and -- for one year is going to solve the problem .\" Governor Walker understands, as every governor understands, it is not enough just to kick the can down the road to next year because these problems snowball. They cascade. And that's why it's critical to get ahold of this. For most states the, well, the pay...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But he -- but his argument is that the unions are so unreasonable, they won't ultimately make concessions. They've made the concession.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: For a year.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's the whole problem . They've got to change the system. About half the states in the country don't allow or limited -- limit collective bargaining . The federal government doesn't have collective bargaining for wages, for health benefits . I mean, this -- people act like this is some right, you know, that these are collective bargaining rights. There's no right to this under the Constitution .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Lawrence O'Donnell , how do you read this?\n\nMR. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL: Well, you know, one of the things I was struck by in your interview with the governor is, just to go back to a point, is that he said that he rejected , rejected the idea of sending in troublemakers to the demonstrations. That means the idea was discussed. That means someone in the governor's office said, \"How about we send some people in there to cause physical trouble in these demonstrations?\" And this governor thought about it, discussed it, rejected it. OK, he rejected it. But to say he rejected it and think, \"Well, that's the end of it, that's a noncontroversial moment ,\" it's quite shocking to think that there was a governor thinking about that.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , you added the word physical. Nobody ever -- you could talk about should you send people out there to talk to the employees?\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: OK, let's, let's just -- OK, I'll, I'll retract that. Let's just say troublemakers. This -- it's, it's shocking to think the governor, among the things they were discussing was, \"Should we send in troublemakers?\" How long did you -- would you have to discuss that?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let met bring in Congressman Cleaver . I mean, you were on this program last month after the shooting of Gabby Giffords . We talked about tone. We talked about inappropriate public discourse . And I want to show you some of the placards that have been used by demonstrators, pro- union supporters out there. They have cast the governor -- this one here, \"One dictator to go, one dictator down,\" talking about Hosni Mubarak . He has been compared to Hitler . We spent time on this program talking about the nonsense about Obama being a Muslim or not being born in America and asking Republicans if they reject that. Should that kind of discourse be rejected in this fight?\n\nREP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO): Absolutely. It's inappropriate. It should be condemned, not only by people close to the governor, but by those of us who are observers. I think that's something that we've got to squash in, in this country . We've come to a, a, a, a point in this government discussion where, you know, one side says, \"Anything goes to get my point across.\" And I , I think it would be certainly something that I would condemn. But, but, but it goes even further than that. We're not even involved in trying to solve the problems . One side proposes, the other side opposes. That's why we're not making progress. The -- you know, the, the governor is saying here, you know, you know, \"You come back, let's, let's prevent me laying off employees.\" If you -- when, when the lion and the lamb lie down, if you look closely, when the lion gets up the lamb is missing. When the governor says, \"Come back home,\" he's not saying, \"Let's negotiate.\" He's saying, \"Come back home so I can do what I want to do to the unions.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Kim Strassel , I want, I want to bring you in on this. And the president said this was an assault on unions.\n\nMS. KIM STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: He's then gone quiet. Back in 2007 on the campaign trail, this is what he said, if this were to ever come to pass.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: And understand this. If American workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when I'm in the White House , I'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself, I'll walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States of America. Because workers deserve to know that somebody's standing in their corner.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So here he said it was an assault on unions. In the past he said, \"I'll be out there walking with you.\" He's now gone silent. Meantime, he's trying to move to the center politically and try to create jobs. He's put himself in a difficult political situation here.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, as the governor says, he needs to have a pair of shoes on picketing around Washington , D.C. , because federal workers are not allowed any of these collectively bargaining rights that he's talking about there. Look, one of the problems here is that I think the problem for Democrats and unions in this is that it's not necessarily a winning issue here. What's going on in the states is a microcosm of the federal debate , and that is about fiscal responsibility right now. What these governors are saying -- and it's Chris Christie in New Jersey , it's Scott Walker in Wisconsin , it's John Kasich in Ohio ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But they're not going as far on collective bargaining , not in New Jersey , not in Indiana .\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Right. But we're talking about the bigger issue about budgets...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...and how you deal with budgets. You even have Democrats like Andrew Cuomo in New York saying, \"When we look at these budgets, huge ballooning areas of these budgets are due to public sector union benefits, and we cannot touch them because of collective bargaining , because of these things. We need the flexibilities and tools to fix this.\" And so that's a, that's an argument that resonates with Americans . People are talking about trying to cast this as the middle -- an assault on the middle class . It was middle -class taxpayers who elected these guys.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, Richard Trumka ...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: They campaigned on it. They elected them, they put them in office to do this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...is, is, is President Obama doing enough? Is he satisfying you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Look, it's important for the president -- for middle class voters to know that the president is on their side.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But this isn't about President Obama .\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, but I'm asking you whether he's doing enough.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor -- wait.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You heard what he said in 2007 .\n\nMR. TRUMKA: This is about a governor...\n\nMR. GREGORY: He'd be out there with you. He's not out there with you.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: David , this is about a governor who's taken on nurses and EMTs ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mr. Trumka , but answer the question. I asked a very specific question. The president, in 2007 as a candidate, said, \"If this ever happened, I'd be with you.\" Do you think he's with you?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I think, I think he's doing it the right way. He's not taking on workers like Scott Walker is...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: ...and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle class way of life. He stands for that. He's doing that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Could he be doing more?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: He could -- everybody could be doing more.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, that's -- but in this particular case. I mean, Lawrence , I want to go back to the politics here. It is very difficult for a president who wants to move to the center to, before the cannon -- you know, after it fired initially he said it's an assault on unions, then he's gone quiet. And now he's, he's, he's got unhappiness on the left and on the right, and he just wants to be more of a centrist guy right now.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: It would be interesting to see what his choice would be if he was in a second term.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Hm.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: This is someone who won Wisconsin . He has to win Wisconsin again. There is chaos there right now. Politically, he doesn't know how this is going to play three months from now. If a large majority or significant majority of Wisconsin likes the outcome, whatever it is, a few months from now, that's where the president wants to be going into his re- election there.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, you know, talking about...\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: So that's why he's staying out of it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, and I want to talk about the politics some more. Howard Fineman , in The Huffington Post , had an analysis about this and how, in many ways, this is about the GOP 's attempts to win more governor seats around the country . He talks about it, \"The Real Political Math in Wisconsin . What happened?\" Why did Republicans only get 12 this last go-round? \"Well, according to GOP strategists and Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi who chaired the [ RGA ] in 2010 the power and money of public-employee unions was the reason. ... \" The GOP strategic aim is simple enough. If they can abolish union collective-bargaining rights, they can undermine the automatic payment of dues to the public-employee union treasuries. Shrinking those treasuries and reducing the union structure and membership will make it harder for Democrats ... to communicate directly with workers.\"\n\nMR. TRUMKA: There it is.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Now, that's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, that's....\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, no, but...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: That's what Howard said.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Do you disagree with him?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Look, this is about -- this is a state issue in a state where they've got serious budget problems because payroll pensions are such a huge part of the budget you got to deal with it , and you can't deal with it for one year. I have some...\n\nMR. GREGORY: This is a national movement , I thought . I thought it was a national movement . OK.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Let's talk about -- you asked about the president.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: The president is one of the greatest politicians in the history of the United States , and he -- and he's quiet because he understands that most Americans know this has to be done.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Congressman, where -- hold on, let me get Congressman...\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Let's sue him for breach of promise and move on. I mean, let's -- you know, the reality is that the, the, the president needs to be in Washington dealing with a plethora of issues around the world, not the least of which is Libya . But I want to go back to something that, that you said actually twice, Governor, and, and that is you said, you know, this is -- would be a one-year agreement. The governor was just elected. He'll still be governor in a year. And, you know, the, the, the agreements that we have were not made by Gadhafi . They were made by people who sat down in a room and worked out a, worked out an agreement. And I think labor unions are saying, and, and public sector employees are saying, \"OK, you know, maybe things have gotten out of balance. We'll, we'll, we'll reduce some things.\" The governor is saying, \"I don't care.\" You know, \"I want to crush the union .\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to, I want to get to a break. Richard Trumka , I want to ask you one thing, again, about the tone of the debate . You're one of the leading labor voices in the country . Do you condemn the hyperbole, the overstatements, comparisons to Hitler and dictators? Do you think that's wrong on the part of pro- union supporters?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We want to -- I -- look, we ought to -- pro, anti- union , it doesn't matter.\n\nMR. GREGORY: It's inappropriate.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: We should be sitting down trying to create jobs. When -- and look, if you think that the argument that you're doing in Wisconsin is winning, as you said, Kim , the polls show that every -- Wisconsin , vast majority of the people think this governor has overreached. His popularity has gone down. They're saying to him, \"Sit down and negotiate. Don't do what you've been doing.\" So he's losing. If that's the argument you're going to do this year or next year, it's a loser for, for anybody who advocates it.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: And I don't know why you fear democracy so much. You're saying that this is a temporary agreement. It's a, it's a result of democracy in Wisconsin . Republicans won Wisconsin , and, and the, and Republicans ran on this. And now they're doing this. If the idea remains popular, and if it has democratic support in Wisconsin , meaning support of the democracy of Wisconsin , why would you worry about leaving this agreement out there so that it -- and allowing collective bargaining so that the -- Wisconsin can democratically express itself in the future as being in favor or opposed to more or less government spending on workers?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, Larry , it, it is precisely because I do believe in democracy . We had an election in 2010 , and Wisconsin voted for a Republican governor, a Republican senator, two Republican Houses of the legislature , and they have determined this is the best way to go forward to get the budget of that state , in effect, which they were elected to do. Look at Indiana . In Indiana this was done six years ago by the governor. It has been very popular. Nobody put Mitch Daniels ' picture with a, with a crosshair over his face like they're doing in Wisconsin . You know, if Sarah Palin , did that, you know...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well...\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...it would be the world coming to an end.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right, quick -- Kim , quick point, and then I want to get to a break.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Well, actually, in fairness, I mean, Governor Daniels was -- did get some blow-back when he did this six years ago.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: And his approval ratings did go down, but the problem -- the question is, what happens in the end? People want to see balanced budgets . And what's interesting is, Governor Daniels is one of the few states , because he ended up with that flexibility in his budget to negotiate, he's had -- been in the black for the past five or six years, even when other states have not.\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me get a break in here. I want to talk a little bit about the budget woes here in Washington , as well as what's going on in the Middle East , right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We are back with our roundtable . Congressman Cleaver , I want to talk about the president's budget and the spending showdown here in Washington . We're actually not talking a great deal about the budget yet because there's this prospect of a government shutdown because Republicans , Democrats can't seem eye to -- see eye to eye on spending for just the rest of this fiscal year. This is a statement that you put out about the president's budget . And I 'll put it up on the screen. \"Rebuilding our economy ,\" you wrote, \"on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans is something I simply cannot accept. ... \"I understand that now is the time for us as a nation to sacrifice in order to protect our children from a certain amount of debt; however, I'm struggling to understand how this budget helps us best to achieve this critical goal. Cutting funding to programs that assist hardworking Americans , help families heat their homes, and expand access to graduate-level education seems to conflict with the notion of winning the future . We cannot win the future by leaving our most vulnerable behind.\" Do we have the balance wrong as we approach spending this year and look ahead to the president's budget ?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: Absolutely. Let me, let me preface my comment on that by, by just saying, you know, disagreement does not equal disassociation or disaffection. And disagreement among friends is the insignia of a healthy relationship. We've, we've got to disagree with the president when we think that he's moving in a direction that's disturbing. But, at the same time, I do think that real cuts needs to be made. But, but let's keep in, in mind, you know, I think we're dangerously cutting. Ben Bernanke has warned Congress in, in a hearing that cavernous cuts could hurt what is a rickety recovery. And Goldman Sachs , in, in, in an analysis released last week, said that even if the proposed cuts are reduced to 25 billion for the first year and 50 billion for next year that it would still create a, a 1 percent cut in economic growth of the GDP .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, but, Lawrence , there is a stop-gap measure that looks like it'll head off a shutdown. But then the president's still going to have to engage on the fact that Republicans , Democrats are far apart on these huge cuts Republicans want for this year.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: They are. It looks like they're going to avoid this Friday's possible shutdown and, and have a two week extension. They seem to have agreed on that by John Boehner basically taking the cuts the president has identified in the future and saying, \"Let's start doing them now.\" That, that's the cut package that they will include in their ongoing resolution. But the problem with this dialogue is, it all begins after our failure on recognizing what the top tax rate burdens should really be. And, and keeping them down has created this much more serious deficit situation going forward. We've been ignoring for years the reality of what has happened in the super rich level of income in this country . We should have several higher top tax brackets . It shouldn't stop at a couple of hundred thousand dollars . We have incomes, we have short-stops making $15 million who are paying the same tax rate as, you know, two UCLA married professors. This is outrageous. We have people on Wall Street in deals making $300 million in a day and they pay that same top tax rate as people making a couple of hundred thousand dollars . And so we're ignoring this massive revenue possibility in the high end of incomes in this country .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And as this debate goes on, Kim , you can respond to that, but I also want to talk about another threat to the economy that is coming from the events that we're talking about in the Middle East . I thought this cartoon by Jim Margulies captured it, a syndicated cartoonist. \"The price of liberty,\" he says in the cartoon, \"is $5.00 a gallon.\" And we're talking about Libya , only 2 percent of the oil market, but very important in Europe.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And it's the speculation that causes folks to pay more for gas here. How does this imperil this economy ?\n\nMS. STRASSEL: No, that, that is the real problem , is speculation, at the moment . As you said, Libya is 3 percent of the oil market and you've already had the Saudis come out and say we can replace the oil that's not coming out of Libya . What you're seeing here is, is traders worried that this Arab revolt is going to spread to places like Saudi and they are building in some of that worry into the price . That's why you've seen the spike. This acts as a tax on the economy . You know, every time we -- I think we import 7.5 -- or we use 7.5 billion barrels of oil a year, every time $10 a barrel price hike, that's a huge new tax on the economy . Now, some of this, by the way, I should point out, isn't just Libya and speculation. We're also seeing in here part of Ben Bernanke 's quantitative easing and inflation working its way into oil prices as well.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: We're also seeing, David , the administration's energy policy , which is driving down American oil production . I mean, the shutting down of the Gulf of Mexico , taking lands in Alaska off, the, the issues that they are raising. America 's going to produce about 13 percent more domestic petroleum this year. Now, how is that in our interest at a time like this or at any other time?\n\nMR. GREGORY: You, you talk about that in terms of energy policy as someone who may run for president. And we'll talk more about politics after the break. As you look at the Middle East , what concerns you about U.S. posture toward that region?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, look, I'm one of these guys who believes, as Senator Vandenberg used to say, that in politics, it should stop at the water's edge when it comes to foreign policy . I'm not going to be critical of the administration, but I do think on their domestic energy policy , it is greatly compounding this problem . We're blowing past $3 a gallon, on our way to $4 a gallon, maybe Jim Margulies is right. Four dollar gasoline brought my state and a lot of places to their knees in 2008 before there ever was a meltdown on Wall Street .\n\nMR. GREGORY: All right. Let me, let me get another break in here. We'll come back, talk politics for 2012 and what Wisconsin means for that and a couple of other topics, when we come back with our roundtable right after this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our final moments with our roundtable . Everything has political implications. Let's talk about the politics. The news this week for 2012 , Senator Thune has decided that he will not run for president, John Thune , from South Dakota . And you look at the Gallup Poll and here's the list, this crowded field. Huckabee and Romney look to be at the top. And there's Governor Barbour at 3 percent. And, Governor, as you look at this, and this -- the field continues to be unsettled, how will you make the calculation about whether you'll run.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: I didn't know my family was that big, 3 percent. It's a, it's a very critical decision . It's a family decision in many ways. In fact, in most ways. But I'm not going to make a decision until April. I'm going to finish my legislature , get my job done, get my budget passed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But how do you decide -- but how to make that calculation based on what you're seeing?\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Because there seems to be a lot of late entries here.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Whether or not anybody else runs is irrelevant to my decision. I'm going to make the decision based on things that I think. And I don't want to take everybody else 's time going through all the things that I would have to think...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: ...that I am thinking about.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Richard Trumka , how do you assess that Republican field right now, who you'll be organizing against?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Well, they'll be a lot of them, probably.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMR. TRUMKA: But...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Is there a front-runner?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I, we'll...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Do you, who's most formidable in your mind?\n\nMR. TRUMKA: I don't know. I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go there on either side, the Democrats or Republicans . That's a debate that needs to take place. But, you know, Governor Walker what he's done and people like him, governors like him, they've energized the working class voters. And that momentum that we've picked up, the demonstrations that you're seeing in Madison isn't just in Madison . They're around the country . And that momentum is going to continue on. And, Haley , I hope you don't stake your whole campaign on taking away the right of workers to be able to earn a middle class income, because I don't think that's a winner for you at this time.\n\nGOV. BARBOUR: Well, I want to stake my campaign on the right of taxpayers to be able to pay so that the state employees can keep their jobs and don't have to be laid off.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let, let, let me ask you...\n\nMR. TRUMKA: Those state , those state , those state workers are taxpayers.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me ask about, about, about health care , Lawrence O'Donnell . As Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , who has taken on Mitt Romney , this is what he said in the Associated , Associated Press , as they covered it. \" Huckabee said Wednesday that potential White House rival Romney should offer an apologize for healthcare overhaul that he oversaw as Massachusetts governor .\" Quoting him, \"I think it's not a killer for him, but he has to say either 'I love it,' 'I hate it,' or, 'Hey, I tried it, it didn't work and that's why I should say to you let's not do it nationally.'\" He goes on, \"He's got to figure out how he wants to deal with it . It's the 800-pound elephant in the room for him.\" Now, Romney has stood by it, but said it's something that the states should work out.\n\nMR. O'DONNELL: Well, Huckabee is right in identifying this is what's wrong with the Romney candidacy. And, in fact, you can go down through the list and do that with pretty much every one of the possible Republican candidates, with the exception of Tim Pawlenty , who I think is the one who is going to start moving ahead because he has no serious negative. You have thoughtful Republicans starting to support him. The ideal candidate is a Midwesterner , and that usually is true for both parties because that's where the battleground states are. With Thune dropping out, Pawlenty becomes more important in the field. But Romney has the same- -this is identical, virtually identical politically to the problem Hillary Clinton had going into that primary field , where she had to disown or own the vote in support of the Iraq war . This is much more serious. The, the, what, what Romney did on health care is much more difficult thing to overcome in the primaries. I don't think he can.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: I think that's not, not alone. I actually, that's not the only issue. And I actually agree with Richard here that what is happening in Wisconsin is going to have very big implications for the, the primaries on both sides, and in particular in this case, because the other 800-pound gorilla in the room, besides health care , is fiscal responsibility .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right.\n\nMS. STRASSEL: You see the president entirely focused on it at the moment . And this is going to play into Republican governors...\n\nMR. GREGORY: And, Congressman...\n\nMS. STRASSEL: ...in particular who are running and their record in the states .\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...are, are Republicans running circles around Democrats and the president on the issue of fiscal responsibility , from the states to cutting in Washington ? Is that how you view it?\n\nREP. CLEAVER: No, absolutely not. The -- what, what the Republicans are mistakenly doing is pushing cuts that will hurt the very people who voted for them. And when people realize what is happening to them and their families, there will be, I think, a great deal of buyers regret, and we'll look up and see that President Obama is surging again. To, to beat somebody, you got to run somebody. This is the only person that I'm endorsing to run against Barack Obama at the moment .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah. Really? You'd endorse Governor Barbour .\n\nREP. CLEAVER: To run against Barack Obama.\n\nMR. GREGORY: To run against him, OK.\n\nREP. CLEAVER: You know, David ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're going to, we're going to have to leave it there. We're out of time. Thanks to all of you. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss an endorsement there. Before we go, a quick programming note. You can watch the rebroadcast of today's program this afternoon on MSNBC at 2 PM Eastern, followed by a re-airing of Chris Matthew 's special\n\n\"President of the World: The Bill Clinton Phenomenon.\" That's at 3 PM Eastern time .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nGRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Forty Republican members of Congress are furious at ABC News. They say ABC News is unprofessional and violating the ethics of journalism and slanting the news for President Obama. ABC News has been given all access to the White House, and in a primetime special on ABC News, President Obama will talk about his health care plan. Any problem with that? A group called the Media Fairness Caucus says yes and wrote a letter to ABC News slamming the network.\n\nCongressman Lamar Smith heads the Media Fairness Caucus. He was supposed to be with us live but is busy voting, but he does join us by phone. Congressman, nice to at least hear from you. Tell me, Congressman, what's wrong with this?\n\nREP. LAMAR SMITH - R - TEXAS (VIA TELEPHONE): Very good to be with you. Well, what's wrong with this is, as you just mentioned, ABC devoted all their newscasts today, morning, noon, evening, and then they culminated in a town hall meeting from the White House tonight with a hand-picked audience, and the president had the last word. That really amounts to a day-long informational (SIC). It's not giving the American people the facts. It's not letting them make up their own minds. It's telling them what to think. And it is unprofessional. The code of ethics for journalists says that they have a duty to provide a fair and comprehensive account (INAUDIBLE) issues. Clearly, this is not...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you -- OK, all right, I haven't seen this code of ethics. Lawyers have a code of professional responsibility, which I'm always quick to point out. Here's the thing. Everything that happened today on ABC is recorded or Tivoed or we have access to it. Now that ABC News has done that, we now know the White House -- we should know the comprehensive view of the White House on health care. Doesn't it instead give all of us an opportunity to go over it with a fine-toothed comb tomorrow to see what we like and what we don't like? Is there any problem with that?\n\nSMITH: No, we should, but the problem is, we only heard one side. Anybody who was watching ABC today...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: We'll hear it tomorrow. We'll hear it tomorrow. I mean, people are going to pick it apart tomorrow. In some ways, now at least we know what the White House, what the president's doing.\n\nSMITH: We certainly know...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Tomorrow we can pick apart.\n\nSMITH: Yes. Well, I hope -- you know, if ABC allows individuals to pick it apart tomorrow, those watching ABC will get both sides. But right now, they've only gotten one side. And it was like...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Yes, but...\n\nSMITH: It was like a rigged football game. They had -- the president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, the ads is a wholly different thing. And I'll agree with you on the ads. But tomorrow, I bet that FOX, CNN, even MSNBC and NBC and CBS -- I bet they will all be critiquing what the president said about health care.\n\nSMITH: Well...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: And but for this forum tonight -- and it's almost like a direct examination was tonight and now tomorrow, everybody can cross- examine it. And but for today, we wouldn't have that chance.\n\nSMITH: Right. But the problem with that is that the three networks, who have 10 times the number of viewers as FOX, for example -- they have 24 million viewers. FOX has 2.5 million. But the problem is that those three networks have all been given slanted coverage to the president's health care plan. You have ABC -- since January, for example, they interviewed 58 people in favor of the health care plan, only 18 opposed, three to one. They are not presenting both sides. And the American people deserve to get both sides if they're going to be able to make good decisions.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: All right, one hour on ABC is 44 minutes, taking into account all the -- ABC News -- taking into account all the commercials. Tomorrow, there's going to be -- you know, the 24/7 of all the cables, so I'm not so sure -- and I realize that they have more viewers on broadcast as opposed to cable news, but we have so much more time on it that I'm not -- you know, that I don't know how it'll balance out.\n\nBut I guess -- I guess the other thing is, that -- you know, it's, like, it seems to me that this is an opportunity for all of us, for Americans to now -- to look at it with a fine-toothed comb. And I may be the only one who's not scandalized by it, and frankly, I haven't yet seen it, so I got to take a look at it, so...\n\nSMITH: Well, it's...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... it may even be premature for me to be scandalized anyway.\n\nSMITH: If you'd seen how one-sided it is, you'd be scandalized because it is not representing good journalism. It has not presented both sides. It is not giving the American people the facts. You have a recent Gallup poll, for example, that says on 9 percent of the American people think the news media reports the news accurately and fairly -- 9 percent. So the...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Well, that's another -- that's -- that's a whole other issue, but Congressman, maybe -- let's see in 24 hours whether or not everybody has gone over this and -- with a fine-toothed comb. You may be right, but let's at least give it a shot tomorrow, see whether this has been...\n\nSMITH: Well, I...\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: ... dissected.\n\nSMITH: I hope people will take the time to look at the other side. They certainly didn't get it from ABC.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, for joining us.\n\nSMITH: Thank you.\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: Sorry it couldn't be in person because I know you're busy voting. Thank you, sir.\n\nSMITH: All right. Bye-bye.\n\n\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2009 FOX News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN projects Mitt Romney the winner, the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN projects that the former Massachusetts governor has a decisive win in the caucuses in Nevada. Mitt Romney going ahead, capitalizing on his dramatic win in Florida, now capturing Nevada as well.\n\n\n\nWe do not -- we do not yet know who's going to come in second, who's going to come in third. But there is a dramatic -- a dramatic race under way for second and third place. But now you can see Romney headquarters in Las Vegas. The crowd hearing the news that Mitt Romney has won the Nevada caucuses. Very, very excited.\n\n\n\nJim Acosta is our man over at Mitt Romney headquarters in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nJim, the crowd pretty excited there, as they should be.\n\n\n\nJIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. This is a very pumped up crowd. It's also a very big crowd. You know, we talked over the last couple of weeks that this campaign that Mitt Romney has at times had trouble drawing large crowds. That is not the case tonight. It's a very big boisterous crowd here for the former Massachusetts governor.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, we are expecting to see Mitt Romney come out here and address this crowd within the hour. It was thought that he might come on in about an hour from now, but they might move things up a little sooner. They obviously have some ground to cover over the next couple of days.\n\n\n\nAnd I will tell you that one interesting thing, I think, that you can point to from the Romney campaign, a sign of confidence perhaps is they're kind of taking a day off tomorrow, Wolf, after they wrap up this day. They're having a down day here in Las Vegas. They're probably going to watch a football game tomorrow.\n\n\n\nBut then it's off to Colorado to get ready for the Tuesday caucuses in that state. But you can hear the crowd chanting behind me, \"Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\" This is a very happy crowd here tonight and for good reason. Mitt Romney is doing something tonight that he hasn't done in this campaign so far -- that's win two in a row -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The event tonight, where you are, where in Las Vegas are you, at a casino, a hotel?\n\n\n\nACOSTA: We are. We're at the Red Rock Casino, sort of on the western edge of Las Vegas, out by those Red Rock canyons, which is so beautiful here in this state. And, you know, it's been one of those crowds that we -- they've been waiting outside of this ballroom for the last couple of hours to get in, and they sort of letting those crowd in about 30 minutes ago. And you can see, you know, people of all shapes and sizes coming in here, families.\n\n\n\nThere's also a good sizable crowd of Mormon supporters for Mitt Romney. That's not too surprising. And according to all of our entrance polls, 26 percent, 27 percent of these Republican voters who are casting their votes for Mitt Romney in these caucuses are from the LDS Church and some of those folks here tonight as well, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A lot of supporters of Mitt Romney out in Las Vegas tonight. A dramatic win for Mitt Romney coming on the heels of a dramatic win in Florida, earlier New Hampshire, almost in Iowa.\n\n\n\nSoledad, let's send it over to you. Big night for Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nSOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, it was. Gloria Borger, David Gergen joining me now. The victory was not a surprise. From the get- go, we knew that he was way ahead in the polls, most likely would win, and the percentage was what we're going to look for. What's the big take away then?\n\n\n\nDAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: But it's still a very significant night, and that is Mitt Romney has now won three out of five all together. He's got the last two. He's got two big battleground states in a row.\n\n\n\nAnd in looking towards the fall, Republicans want a nominee who can compete very, very well in a battleground state. There are about a dozen of them. There are a couple more coming up. There's a good chance Mitt Romney is going to win both of those. And that's going to put him in an even more commanding position.\n\n\n\nThe question has still -- is out there, though, is the turnout down significant tonight? What should we read into that? We're learning that as the night goes on.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: And there's some early indication in rural areas that it's down 20 percent, which is a huge number.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes. His unfavorables have gone up nationally. He is, you know, locked in tight races with some of these battleground states with Obama head to head. But there are some things that are changing in this in terms of he has to pay a lot of attention to. If he can win and wrap this up fairly quickly, it will allow him to pivot and do more than essentially beat up on Obama.\n\n\n\nI think he's got to present himself as a much fuller candidate. He's got to connect in ways far beyond what he's done so far. He's got to be listening and related to people who are, you know, lower income people, working people.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: So he has to shed Santorum and shed Gingrich before he can do \\that. GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, if the key point you were making is it has to be wrapped up ...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: ...and from what we've heard from Newt Gingrich's daughters and from our own reporting is that Newt Gingrich is resetting his campaign, and that's probably what we're going to hear about tonight. That we've learned he's been meeting not only with campaign donors today, but also with top staff to figure out what he does going forward.\n\n\n\nDoes he become a more positive candidate again? Remember, he started out positive, went negative, maybe positive again. And how does he proceed to talk about the Reagan legacy...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: ...which he says is what he represents?\n\n\n\nGERGEN: And one last point on this. What you can see happening as he emerges as the all but certain nominee, you can see the Obama forces and the left in general, the press in general, starting to gang up on him and they're going to try to define him.. A lot of people will gang up on Romney. He's got to be able to take that on. He can't spend all of his time worried about Santorum and Gingrich.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: As we move forward, let's talk about the next contest. Jessica Yellin is at the White House for us.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, that would be Colorado, Jessica, which, of course, is a very strong state for President Obama.\n\n\n\nJESSICA YELLIN, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It is -- or was a strong state for President Obama, Soledad. You remember he held the convention, the Democratic convention there four years ago. It was a purple state -- we always like to call it that -- that he won.\n\n\n\nBut now it's, you know, up for grabs and it will be one of those states that both men, whoever the nominee on the Republican side is, will fight to hold and it will be one of those decisive states.\n\n\n\nNow, the Obama team thinks that if they can pick up, for example, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, those states cobbled together could make up for, say, a loss in Ohio, if they have to put up with that, and still get a victory and win the White House in November. So they're looking at different alternative ways to win in November.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Jessica Yellin at the White House.\n\n\n\nYou know, the inevitability thing, if there's something that's been proven over the last maybe two, three weeks, maybe even a month, is that that does not just work.\n\n\n\nBORGER: It doesn't work. You know, it's funny, because I think when the Romney campaign started, there was this sort of air of inevitability about him. And what the people...\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Connected to electability.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Sure, it's connected to electability. But what the people in the campaign learned very quickly is that inevitability is not a campaign message. That voters actually think they ought to be able to vote and decide who's going to become the candidate.\n\n\n\nSo, inevitability in and of itself is not a message. What he has to play upon is what you just mentioned -- I'm the most electable in these swing states, look at my numbers against Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nBut, again, he's still going to have to pay some attention to Newt Gingrich and to Rick Santorum, who will both be out there criticizing him as just more Obama.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with you, Soledad. It's just been a lot of volatility and unpredictability about this and they could well continue. But think about this. A couple of weeks ago, there was a very plausible path for Newt Gingrich to the nomination. That seems less plausible tonight.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Much less.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: There is no plausible path that I can see for Ron Paul to get the nomination. It's increasingly impossible that Rick Santorum can win the nomination. So, yes, I can't see Mitt Romney losing it, but it's hard to see these other guys winning it. You know, that's why I think it becomes...\n\n\n\nBORGER: But the question is, what damage do they do to Mitt Romney along the way?\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with that totally.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Yes, that is something...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Very good point.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer has a close look inside the victory tonight.\n\n\n\nWolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A dramatic victory for Mitt Romney. We're getting ready to hear from the Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nThese folks are standing by, John. Let's go behind this dramatic win by Mitt Romney in Nevada tonight.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: And, Wolf, to David Gergen's point. Part of this is psychology. Governor Romney trying to convince the Republican electors, even those who don't love him, look, I've got this wrapped up, and look, a big win in Florida, now a big win in Nevada.\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at entrance poll in Nevada, now an exit poll. This is the way they showed up front. Who won among moderate and liberal voters? Republicans who showed up and described themselves as moderate or liberal Republicans, Governor Romney did.\n\n\n\nWho won among Republicans who showed up at the caucus describing themselves as somewhat conservative? Governor Romney did.\n\n\n\nWho won among those who described themselves as very conservative? Governor Romney did. And that's very important because that's the place he's been weaker in previous states.\n\n\n\nWhat about the big issues? You see no faces here. That's because such a small percentage said abortion was an issue or illegal immigration. The two biggest issues were the economy and the budget deficit, both of those won by Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nIf you look right here, who has the right experience? Governor Romney. Strong moral character. Voters who said that was the most important to their choice -- Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nWho is the true conservative? Here's one weak spot. Ron Paul won among a small group that said that was their number one priority. This 45 percent of the voters in the Nevada caucus said this was their number one priority.\n\n\n\nAnd again, Governor Romney winning among those who say defeating President Obama was the top priority, getting almost three out of every four votes. Speaker Gingrich, a distant second. This has been Gingrich's strength in the State of South Carolina, Wolf. The voters there thought he was more electable and that was important. Now, two states in a row have said Governor Romney and here in Nevada tonight, by a huge margin.\n\n\n\nLet's just look at one more as we come down the line here. If you look here among faith, obviously Governor Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He's a Mormon, and he won big among Mormons. He won 9 out of every 10 votes among Mormons. Congressman Paul coming in second place. But he also won those who say they have no religion, voted for Congressman Paul.\n\n\n\nBut others Christians, Mormons, Catholics, Mainline Protestants, all going for Governor Romney. This is a sweep across the electorate tonight. Some would say, well, it was a state he won in 2008, so what, who cares?\n\n\n\nBut the point, beginning February with a win and a big win, starts the process in which team Romney thinks they could run the entire month, perhaps losing in Maine to Ron Paul. The psychology is going to kick in at some point.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Gingrich says he has a delegate strategy. He's in to Tampa. That's to try to convince fundraisers, if the next few weeks are pretty tough, keep sending me money. That's a tough argument to make.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And as I said, Romney getting ready to speak to his supporters out in Las Vegas. And at some point, Newt Gingrich is going to have a news conference in Last Vegas. But I want to go to the White House right now. Jessica Yellin is standing by.\n\n\n\nJessica, you and I know, John knows, everyone in Washington knows that the Obama re-election campaign for a long time has simply assumed that Mitt Romney would get the Republican nomination. They've been fighting him for a long time.\n\n\n\nYELLIN: They have and this has been a good week for them on that front, Wolf, because Mitt Romney essentially handed them a series of campaign commercials. In a sense, he locked in the campaign message that they want to do. They want a contrast campaign, as we've been talking about, on the economy, where they can say that Mitt Romney is out of touch with regular folks.\n\n\n\nAnd by giving that interview with Soledad, no matter what the Romney campaign wants to say about taking it out of context, etcetera, it locks in this narrative that the Obama team wants to run with, that he is out of touch. And no matter what they say, they can at least replay those sound bites in a stream with, \"I like to fire people,\" and \"I'm not worth that much money\" or whatever he'd said in a campaign ad that will be played over and over. You can bet, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Jessica, stand by. We're going to be coming back to you. We're also standing by to hear from Mitt Romney. He's going to be speaking to his supporters in Las Vegas at that hotel. That's coming up fairly soon. The crowd is excited. We have projected that Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. At some point later, there will be a news conference by Newt Gingrich. We'll take that live as well. You'll hear the questions from reporters, his answers. He supposedly has a new strategy, is about to unveil tonight to try to get the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nI'll speak with Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. We're standing by for that. Also there's a special caucus under way in Las Vegas. Right now there's some surprise developments happening right now. You're looking at live pictures from this caucus. We're going to go there. You're going to want to see this. Our coverage will continue from the CNN election center right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mitt Romney is the winner of the Nevada caucuses. CNN has made that projection. We're going to be hearing from Mitt Romney. He is getting ready to speak to supporters at this hotel in Las Vegas. Stand by for that.\n\n\n\nNewt Gingrich not the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's going to hold a news conference at some tonight. We're going to have that live. He's taking questions from reporters, supposedly will outline a new strategy going forward. I'll also be interviewing Rick Santorum, the Republican presidential candidate. Stand by for that as well.\n\n\n\nThe votes, let's take a look at the votes right now as we actually have them with 13 percent of the vote in. Mitt Romney decisively ahead of Newt Gingrich, 47 percent to 22 percent. A battle, though, under way for second place. Ron Paul, right now with 13 percent of the vote in, coming in third at 19 percent. Rick Santorum at 12 percent. But a very impressive win for Mitt Romney in Nevada right now.\n\n\n\nThere's actually a special caucus that's been taking place in Las Vegas and it's a fascinating development. Our own Paul Steinhauser is standing by with some details of this.\n\n\n\nPaul, tell us what's happening at this special caucus.\n\n\n\nPAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Wolf, this special caucus was supposed to start at the top of the hour and as you can see, no action yet. People are starting to file into the auditorium here at the Adelson Educational Complex, named after Sheldon Adelson who donated a lot of money to build this school.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing, Wolf. To take part in this caucus, you have to have to get into -- you have to sign this affidavit to get in, Wolf. And two things you have to sign, you have to say that you didn't take part earlier today in the caucuses in Clark County. They started at 9:00 a.m. local time. And you also have to say the reason you didn't take part and vote in the presidential preference poll in the earlier caucuses is because of your religious beliefs. This caucus is basically for a lot of Orthodox and other very observant Jews, Seventh Day Adventists and others who could not take part during the Sabbath until sun down was over.\n\n\n\nOK, so that's the story. Why it hasn't started yet. Still about 200 people to come in. But there was a little bit of fireworks about a half hour ago, Wolf. A guy called Evan Donahue, he says he's a delegate for Ron Paul. He says he's a volunteer for the Paul campaign out here in Nevada. He was not allowed in because, obviously, he had already voted and he was not an observant Jew or a Seventh Day Adventist. There was a scuffle and take a listen how it played out.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This building is private property. You are making me very upset, sir. I'm not going nowhere. You're not taking me anywhere. All of you folks are committing a felony. This says, conducted openly in such a manner that it's open to any registered voter. I am a registered voter, sir. I want to see what is going on in there. You are not making me leave. I am not leaving. I am not leaving. I will never leave. You will never stop me. I am here to defend democracy and I want to see what's going on.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTEINHAUSER: Well, Donahue says that the practices here by the Nevada GOP are discriminatory because to get in you have to sign this affidavit. The Nevada GOP is here, as well, obviously, the Clark County GOP, and they say, listen, this is a caucus, it's run by the party, party rules.\n\n\n\nWell, Evan Donahue is right here behind me right now. He is here. He says he's here to observe and we'll see what happens.\n\n\n\nWolf? BLITZER: So there's one thing, just to be precise, one thing to actually vote in this special caucus, it's another thing to just go in and observe what's going on. That's what this Ron Paul supporter wanted to do. He didn't vote. He already voted. He was just there to observe, is that right?\n\n\n\nSTEINHAUSER: That's what he says. But just to get into the room, you have to sign this affidavit. So, according to the Nevada, you know, the Clark County rules, he shouldn't be in the room right now because he already voted earlier in the day. A lot of other people have been turned away, Wolf, because they voted and couldn't sign this affidavit and still about 100 or 200 people out there waiting to get in, so we haven't started yet here, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We'll stay in close touch with you. Paul Steinhauser, thanks very, very much.\n\n\n\nWe're waiting to hear from Mitt Romney. He's the winner of the Nevada caucuses. He's getting ready to speak to his supporters at a hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nOnce again, later, Newt Gingrich is not going to be speaking to supporters, he's going to be answering questions from reporters. He's getting ready to hold a news conference. We'll take that live, as well.\n\n\n\nI'll be speaking with Rick Santorum, another of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates. Earlier, I spoke with Ron Paul. Our special coverage will continue right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Check it out, two very different pictures over here. The Romney headquarters at a hotel in Las Vegas. Lots of supporters getting ready to hear from the winner of the Nevada caucuses. That would be Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nOver here on the right, Newt Gingrich headquarters, not a big crowd up there. No crowd at all. He's not going to give a speech. He's going to do a news conference. He's going to answer reporters' questions, supposedly getting ready to unveil a new strategy he wants to implement in the struggle to get the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nWe'll see both of those events live. We'll also speak with Rick Santorum at some point tonight. We spoke earlier with Ron Paul. In the meantime, let's check back with Soledad.\n\n\n\nSoledad, big huge night for Mitt Romney. Not necessarily so good for the other candidates, but there is still a fierce battle under way for second place in Nevada.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Yes, absolutely. I think those pictures behind you kind of say it all, don't they? The cheering Romney supporters. And then, waiting for a president, for a Newt Gingrich.\n\n\n\nLet's bring you right to the contributors.\n\n\n\nThe Mormons really delivered for Mitt Romney as we look through the entrance polls. We know that they were able to deliver. Is there anything that you can take from what we know about Mormon response, Mormon commitment to Mitt Romney that you can say and transpose to the general election?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think when you get into the general election, it becomes more -- they become your typical Republican voter, but they're also a funding source for the Romney campaign.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: OK. So, funding. Organization?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Organization will be a good thing for the Mormons. In fact, that was a selling point for Romney, although it didn't pan out for the primaries in 2008. That was one selling point a lot of people made is the way Mormons organize around the country. Those voters, young students will be able to help him. I don't know that that's true as much as hype.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: David Gergen talked a little about this sort of national polls, you see Mitt Romney going down, down, down, even though he's becoming more and more sort of the de facto candidate. And when you ask the question, can the candidate connect with -- understand the problems of America? With President Obama, the polls are like at 55 percent and Mitt Romney polling at the end of January around 39 percent. How big a problem is that?\n\n\n\nROLAND MARTIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, first of all, it's no shock his numbers will be going down because as you get deeper into a primary, his negatives naturally go up, because you have the attacks going back and forth, you have the ads, you have Newt Gingrich slinging arrows, get Rick Santorum in his speech tonight condemning, of course, the health care plan in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nSo, people begin to hear more about you. He is going to have an issue when it comes to connecting with voters. I go back to -- when he goes into Ohio and Pennsylvania and he goes into Michigan, what is he going to say to those voters? How is he going to say, oh, before when I say it, look, let the market take over when it comes to foreclosures, but you're under water. What did I say before when I say let GM go into bankruptcy, but down to automakers. He has to deal with that. Those are real blue collar workers. If he doesn't make the arguments to them, how is he going to win them over to ...\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's already having trouble connecting to the Republican base.\n\n\n\nMARTIN: So I'm saying.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And this is critical for the general election. That's why I keep saying that his win tonight really doesn't have any implications for the general elections other than negative ones I think because he's shown that he can't win the Latino vote.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to say I disagree. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me thinks he lost this primary tonight listening to you guys.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. And to Roland's point, when a voter goes into the voting booth to vote and many studies have been done about this, they vote on their gut. And right now President Obama is winning that battle of who is going to be the candidate who is going to fight for you, who understands what you're going through, and who is going to put forth policies that is going to fight for you.\n\n\n\nAnd that really, that's not just a talking point. If you look at Mitt Romney's plan, his economic plan, a tax cut for middle class families, $167. A tax cut for millionaires, $146,000. That's the reality that he's got to contend with.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: It does make it sound like he lost today, when actually not only did he win, he won by a lot.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But his percentage is lower this year than in 2008.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWILL CAIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It reinforces what Gloria talked about, David talked about. This word we've been batting around for months now of inevitability. When he's now winning tea party supporters, when he's now winning very conservative voters, it reinforces this. He is going to be the nominee. It reinforces inevitability.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf Blitzer's got Rick Santorum now. Wolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let's talk to Rick Santorum, Pennsylvanian senator, the Republican presidential candidate. He's joining us right now.\n\n\n\nSenator, thanks very much for coming in. You're in Colorado. Already didn't waste any time in Nevada. I suspect when you realized you weren't going to do all that well in Nevada, that's why you got out and look ahead to Tuesday's contest in Colorado.\n\n\n\nRICK SANTORUM (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you know, we're playing the demographics, you're playing on Mitt's home court in Nevada. He spent a lot of money, a lot of time there. He's been campaigning there really for five years and organizing, you know, as has Ron Raul. I mean, those are -- these early states, these first five states, you know, there's an inherent advantage to the folks who have run before, that have spent a lot of time and money in those states.\n\n\n\nAnd now we're moving out to states where they had to play sort of catch up four years ago and didn't have the organization, didn't have the strength, didn't run the campaign commercials and didn't have the strong identity. And so we think this is an opportunity for us for this race to begin to turn and begin to come toward our direction.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Have you had the chance to call Mitt Romney and congratulate him yet?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: As a matter of fact, I just got off -- I just gave a speech here in Greeley, Colorado and did a couple of interviews and now I'm doing yours. So I really haven't had a moment to do so. And I understand he's going to speak here in a minute. So I'll try to reach him maybe after he gets off the platform.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: But you will call him? I ask the question only because Newt Gingrich has made a point of not calling him to congratulate him after he won in Florida. But you will call him to congratulate?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Look, you know, one of the things I feel very strongly about is that politics is a rough enough game that it shouldn't be personal. And that when someone has an accomplishment, if someone beats you fair and square, you pick up the phone and you give him a call and you congratulate him for his good work. And we'll see him on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You know, I can't tell you how many people, so-called experts, pundits, analysts, Senator, have said to be the reason that Rick Santorum is staying in the race is that in case Newt Gingrich were to drop out, he could then emerge as the non-Mitt Romney, the so- called real conservative and develop a real challenge to Mitt Romney. Is that the way you're thinking?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I think, eventually, as I said before, this race will come toward us. We're the candidate that provides the real best perspective of beating Barack Obama. I think that's going to become more and more evident. It's just the opposite of what people actually thought at the beginning of this race. I think it's going to become clear.\n\n\n\nLook at the latest Rasmussen Poll that has us beating Obama by a point and has Romney losing by three, Gingrich losing by eighth or nine. The more that this race goes on, the more people see that we present the best chance to win this and you get a twofer. Not only do you get the best chance to win, but you get the candidate who actually holds the values that Republicans generally speak in this country hold.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Tell us what's going to happen on Tuesday in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You know, I think, again, demographically, Colorado is not the best state for us, but I think we can do well here. I think we will do much better than we did in Nevada. I think we can do even better maybe in Minnesota, and Missouri is an interesting one, because Newt is not on the ballot and that presents an opportunity for a one- on-one match up in a state that's a pretty key swing state for Republicans, actually a must-win state for Republicans in this election cycle. So, we're optimistic that we're going to perform very, very well in all three of those states.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I'm going to let you go, but very quickly, your little daughter Bella, how is she doing?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Well, thank you so much for asking, and she is doing just great. She's almost back to -- back as good as new. I just want to thank you and everybody again. It's been a -- and what a relief and thank you for your prayers and for helping us out. It's certainly given a little more hop in my steps these last few days.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Well, give her our love, as you know. Thanks very much, Senator. We'll talk to you on the campaign trail. Rick Santorum joining us from Colorado.\n\n\n\nSoledad?\n\n\n\nSOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Gloria Borger, David Gergen, first of all, we heard from Rick Santorum just now. Ron Paul we heard from a little bit earlier. We're going to hear from Newt Gingrich. We're expecting that for long for now. Mitt Romney, though, will also be coming out to give his acceptance speech. What do we need to hear from him? What you expect to hear from him?\n\n\n\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I expect him to just turn to Barack Obama. I think that he's not going to be talking about Newt Gingrich. He's going to be talking about what a great win this was. But I think he's just going to pivot and talk about Barack Obama, how he can take it to Barack Obama, how he will be better at fixing the economy and all of the things that we've already heard we will hear repeated again.\n\n\n\nDAVID GERGEN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think Gloria is basically right. That's what he did after his New Hampshire win. That's what he did after his Florida win. I would suggest though that's not what he should do tonight. Yes, he should take it to Barack Obama and probably is going to do some of that. But it's more important now that he begin making people understand what he would do, because, you know, he's got this big economic plan. I haven't met a single person that can tell you three things that they could just reel off and say here's what Mitt Romney would do if he will president.\n\n\n\nBORGER: 59-point.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He has a 59-point plan. People don't -- you don't remember that. I can tell you when Reagan was running back in 1980, he had five things he was going to do, everybody knew what they were and he got a mandate out of it.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: He's got to work on connecting with people.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He's got to work on connecting emotionally but also there has to be -- they've got a great line about being a takeover person, somebody who can turn things around. His son did that tonight and his wife Ann has been doing that. But he has now -- will have to sort of say, I can turn things around by doing the following.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Does an improving economy make that an even trickier pivot?\n\n\n\nBORGER: It does because you have to be a little bit more nuisance to mean Republicans cannot be seen to be rooting against an economic recovery. Of course not. What Mitt Romney has said, and probably continues to say, is that Barack Obama hasn't made the recovery occur quickly enough and that it may not be sustained and if you do these 59 things, that maybe you will sustain.\n\n\n\nBut I think this is a point for all of these campaigns. We just heard from Rick Santorum. They're all now refining their message. Rick Santorum is saying, if Gingrich goes, I'm the anti-Romney candidate, and they believe that there's a base of support out there that is anti-Romney. Romney is, I can take on Obama. Newt Gingrich is, I'm the conservative in this race, I can beat...\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Before we leave that -- Rick Santorum, we were talking about this, Rick Santorum. I don't think there's anybody in a race who has grown more than he has.\n\n\n\nBORGER: He has.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: He's sort of -- he is a much, much more appealing candidate today than when he started and the contradiction -- you have to note the contradiction tonight, he's grown as a candidate and yet his chances of winning have gone down. And it's an interesting question. I didn't know about this Rasmussen poll, he actually has moved ahead of Obama by one point.\n\n\n\nBORGER: What's interesting about Rick Santorum is that he has attacked both Gingrich and Romney on health care, but he hasn't been personally negative or nasty.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: I agree with that.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Which he points out in every speech that he gives.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: And he's done very well in these debates because he's just pointed out the contrast. One other thing to say about Newt Gingrich is, he did not have a debate before Nevada. Debates have often given him a lot of oxygen.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Except for Florida.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Except for Florida. But he had (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nGERGEN: You know the state to watch now in terms of Santorum is Ohio. For both Gingrich and Santorum, Ohio. If they can pull out a victory there, that would be huge.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: All right. Well, let's talk about that with our contributors over here. What happens in Ohio if in fact Rick Santorum wins?\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Santorum has been presenting a blue collar message, and that's the exact message that he has to present because, again, white blue collar workers have been -- they have not been breaking President Barack Obama's way. It was a difficult fight for him back in 2008. And so Santorum is playing that kind of message.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: All right. We've got Wolf -- going to go back to Wolf because Mitt Romney is going to the microphone.\n\n\n\nWolf?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Soledad, thanks very much. Ann Romney, the wife of Mitt Romney, is going to introduce her husband. I want all of our viewers to listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Nevada.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: Once again, I'm here to make sure that you listen to me this time and obey when I tell you, don't clap until I'm finished. Nobody listened to me last time. But I do have to give special thanks to all the people that made this happen. And by the way, the most people I need to thank are all the volunteers. So a big thank you to all of you that volunteered.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: Our Nevada coach here, Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki and Congressman Joe Hick. I want to thank Congressman Mark Amodei, our Nevada Finance Chair Mark Hutchinson and the many Nevada elected officials throughout the state who have been so crucial to our success here. We are so appreciative. And, of course, Nevada State Director Sarah Nelson, Nevada Senior Adviser Ryan Irwin, Nevada State Finance Director Cory Christianson.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nA. ROMNEY: And, you know, I want to give a special shout-out to Dema Guinn. You're a first lady of Nevada from a few years ago, and she and I served together as first ladies together and she became a very good friend of mine, and she's been helpful in this effort, too, and we so miss her sweet husband, Kenny. So a shout-out to my friend, Dema, to. Thank you all.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nYou know, as I have just been observing things as I tend to do, I've noticed that Mitt has started to win in states that are so important for the general election. He won in New Hampshire. That is going to be a very important state in the general election. It's a swing state in the general. He did the same thing in Florida. That's going to be a very important state for us to win in the general. We appreciate that.\n\n\n\nBut also this state is going to be an important state in the general, and you guys -\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow that we have all of you excited and energized and volunteering, we're going to need you again next November. So we appreciate that. Maybe some of you are all waking up to figure out that our country is in trouble. We're heading in the wrong direction, and we're looking for a guy that can fix it and turn this economy around and create jobs. So we're excited to introduce the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you. Thank you, guys. Wow, what a great showing. Thank you, Nevada.\n\n\n\nYou know, this is not the first time you gave me your vote of confidence, and this time I'm going to take it to the White House.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nFour years ago, candidate Cbama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings.\n\n\n\nToday, Nevada unemployment is over 12 percent. Home values have plummeted. And Nevada's foreclosure rate is the highest in the nation. I've walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them.\n\n\n\nWell, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, a newly-elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. This week he's been trying to take a bow for 8.3 percent unemployment. Not so fast, Mr. President. This is the 36th straight month with unemployment above the red line your own administration drew. And if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.\n\n\n\nMr. President, America has also had enough of your kind of help.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE (CHEERING): Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Let me ask you -- let me ask you here a question. Did Obama care encourage businesses to hire more people?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did Dodd Frank get banks to renegotiate and make more loans?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did the National Labor Relations Board attack on Boeing in South Carolina encourage employers to expand here?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Did efforts to block the domestic production of energy and the Keystone pipeline speed job creation?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: And did those billions of dollars the president sent to his green energy buddies give anyone here a job?\n\n\n\nPEOPLE: No!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Mr. President, we welcome any good news on the jobs front. But it is thanks to the innovation of the American people in the private sector and not to you, Mr. President.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE (CHEERING): Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: This president's misguided policies made these tough times last longer. Earlier in the week, he spoke with a woman from Texas during an online event. She told him that her husband has been out of work for three years. President Obama said that he found that \"interesting.\"\n\n\n\nInteresting? Really? I've got a better word. Tragic. America needs a president who can fix the economy because he understands the economy, and I do, and I will.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: This president began his presidency by apologizing for America. He should now be apologizing to America. We're not going to settle - we're not going to settle for a president who tells us it could be worse.\n\n\n\nWhat defines us as Americans is our conviction that things must be better. That conviction guides this campaign. It's rallied millions of Americans to our cause, including tens of thousands of Nevadans, who gave me their support here today and I thank them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNevadans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. It's better than 15 percent real unemployment. It's better than $15 trillion in debt. It's better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years and the failed leadership of one man.\n\n\n\nOur campaign is about more than just replacing the president, however. This is really a campaign about saving the soul of America. President Obama says he wants to fundamentally transform America. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOur vision for the future could not be more different than his. President Obama will grow government and amass more trillion dollar deficits. I will not de-slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze -- I will not just freeze government share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And without raising taxes, I will finally balance the American budget.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPresident Obama's brand of capitalism sends your money to his friend's companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius of consumer markets and to the creativity of the American people.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow, like his colleagues in fat lounges, they think they know better. President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will instead make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators and for job creators and get America working again!\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, unlike the other people running for president, I know just how to do that.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIf I'm elected president, my priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nNow, as you know, one of the most important and personal matters of our lives is our health care. President Obama would turn the decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama Care. I will repeal Obama Care.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThe president -- just this week, President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience. I will defend religious liberty and overturn any regulation that tramples on our first freedom, our right to worship as we choose.\n\n\n\nPEOPLE CHEERING: Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense. I will insist on a military so powerful that no one in the world would ever think of challenging us. President Obama seems to believe that America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe the 21st century will be and must be an American century.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nPEOPLE CHEERING: Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney.\n\n\n\nM. ROMNEY: Our mission -- our mission is to increase the freedom and opportunity of the American people and our blueprint is the constitution of the United States. We're going to build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd I will not attempt to bribe the voters with promises of new programs and new subsidies and ever increasing checks from government. If this election is a bidding war of who can promise the most benefits, then I'm not your president. You have that president today.\n\n\n\nBut if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join with us.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIf you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour and not our destiny, then I'm asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember why it was you or your ancestors who sacrificed to come to America and to overcome the challenges of life in a new country, why they came here. It was not for a free ticket, it was for freedom.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nIt was not for the pursuit of government benefits, it was for the pursuit of happiness. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be bigger and better than ourselves. This election, we must fight for the America we love. We believe in America.\n\n\n\nThank you so much and God bless you all.\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThank you! Thank you!\n\n\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThank you! You're the best! Thank you!\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: A very happy Mitt Romney with his family, his kids, his grand kids, celebrating a big win in Nevada, the Nevada caucuses. Right now, Mitt Romney, the winner of the Nevada caucuses. An impressive win coming on the heels of the impressive win in Florida. Now on to the next three contests this coming Tuesday. That will be in Colorado and Missouri and Minnesota.\n\n\n\nWe're waiting also to hear from Newt Gingrich. He's going to be giving a speech tonight. He's going to be having a news conference. Very unusual. Not a traditional event. But then again, the former speaker of the house, not necessarily always a traditional presidential candidate. He's getting ready to outline, we believe, a new strategy going forward as a result of the setbacks he suffered in Florida, also in Nevada right now. So we're expecting to hear from Newt Gingrich very soon. He'll open up with a statement and then will take reporter's questions. We'll watch to see what Newt Gingrich has to say as we get ready for the next three big contests on Tuesday that are coming up.\n\n\n\nBut right now you just heard Mitt Romney. Didn't speak very much about Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum or Ron Paul. Didn't even mention their names. Certainly didn't even refer to them in any great measure. He's apparently already looking ahead to a presidential contest against the president of the United States. Almost all of his words were directly addressed to try to contrast where he stands on so many of these issues as opposed to the president of the United States.\n\n\n\nYou see he's shaking hands right now. One thing you'll see differently than you have in the past, you see U.S. Secret Service personnel. They are with Mitt Romney right now over the past few days. He has started getting Secret Service protection as well.\n\n\n\nSoledad, let me throw it over to you.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Wolf, let's talk to our conservative contributors this evening. And what I want to know -- yes, the two of you, Will Cain and Erick Erickson. What do you think of the speech? To me it sounded very confident, low on specifics.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought it was good. I'll say this, he's getting better at giving speeches and he's getting better at debates. When he does things over and over, he gets better. Do you know where the hole in his game, Soledad, is?\n\n\n\nActually, you do know, because you interviewed him this week. It is on interviews. And he's been reluctant to give interviews. He's not even on Fox with Bret Baier and he's probably not going to -- he's going to be reluctant with his interview with you. Maybe he should do more interviews. The more he does things, the better he gets. Debates, speeches, do more interviews.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought it was the most energetic speech he's given. (INAUDIBLE) Yes, it wasn't heavy on specifics, but these typically aren't that heavy on specifics. It was very energized. I think he realizes where he is. He realizes he's about to be the nominee, unless we get some sort of upset coming up in February.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: As Wolf mentioned, he said he really didn't mention the other guys in the race and I think that's how he didn't mention them in his speech. There's some other people in the race and I'm better than them, too.\n\n\n\nSo those other people in the race, though, could potentially drag him down a bit. I mean, he's been trying to off load them so he can focus on moving forward and they -- I mean, we're going to hear from Newt Gingrich and he has said he's got a new strategy and his strategy is not, I'm getting out of the race.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you know, he's got a delegate number he has to reach. We talk about how he won these states. Well, he's winning delegates. And unless he gets a majority of delegates in the Republican nomination, the other guys can drag him down. They could go into a convention and perhaps someone else. He's got to clear that threshold.\n\n\n\nI suspect probably he will do it because money will dry up for the other guys. But, you know, Gingrich has. He's shaken up his campaign staff. He's got a lawyer from Georgia named Patrick Millsaps as his chief of staff now. He's rearranging his priorities. He's focused on Super Tuesday. Between he and Santorum fighting over evangelicals, that probably keeps Mitt in first, but it could still keep him from getting the delegates.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) Again, anything can happen in a campaign.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: You mean the other guys don't drop out.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Grant it. Romney has been extremely corporate. He's been very disciplined in his approach. But anything can literally happen in a campaign. We saw it in 2008 when the whole issue of Reverend Jeremiah Wright came up. That could have easily derailed the campaign of then Senator Barack Obama. He dealt with it, gave a speech and got out of it. But you never know what can happen based upon one interview, one event. It could literally change the game. That's why you don't get out. It's way too early from a delegate standpoint.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I agree with that. And to Erick's point earlier, the poor comments I don't think have actually trickled down and have the effect that I think they're going to have. And Gingrich and frankly Ron Paul can take advantage of that.\n\n\n\nAnd to your point, Will, he actually didn't win all the demographics. He lost the demographic of people who make $30,000 or less. And again, that underscores the fact that blue-color workers which he cannot win without their vote, do not see that this is a guy who will fight for them.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's a basic fact, though, nothing succeeds like success in politics and in life, OK? And he won tonight and he won big and he has momentum. The other candidates now have to prove to their funders that they should continue to give them money. And this is where the Super PAC story comes in. Because there's very little incentive for a candidate to get out of the race if he's still getting millions of dollars from a Super PAC.\n\n\n\nSo if Sheldon Adelson says to Newt Gingrich, OK, guess what, I'm going to give you $2 million so you can get up to Super Tuesday...\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: David Gergen is nodding his head, yes, yes, yes.\n\n\n\nBORGER: What's the incentive for Newt Gingrich to get out? If Adelson says no, then he doesn't have the juice. He doesn't have the money.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: We've been talking all evening about the need for Mitt Romney to warm up and to reach people. He has one big asset going in that regard -- Ann Romney.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Do you think she's going to jump in and run? No.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Well, I'll tell you something. They've used her now as the warm-up act, in effect, the last couple of times, and she's terrific at it. She's warm, she's humane, she has a quality about her that I think reflects well on him, and I think they've been very smart, they're starting to put him on these events like these tonight. They're putting him in the midst of people thronging around him as opposed to being on a podium back from people with a curtain behind him. It's a much more effective -- he's had a big night. I think he still needs to work on his speeches but he's getting better.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a contrast to Newt Gingrich as well, who rarely do you see his wife introduce him.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: OK. We'll talk about Newt Gingrich because he's coming out. He says he's got the surprising new announcement, a new strategy about delegates that he's going to share with everybody.\n\n\n\nNo, no, actually I don't think he might drop out. I think it's not dropping out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Let's not lie to the people. New strategy about delegates. That's on the other side of this commercial break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n"}

Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\n\n\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."}

We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,\" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, Schiff said, \"We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.\n\n\"Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won.

Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Schiff said there is an \"ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS.\" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.\n\n\"I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,\" he said."}

He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nWhile watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. \"I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,\" Obama said. \"But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\n\nWe checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.\n\n\n\nObama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would \"strongly support\" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.\n\n\n\nWe searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the \"process moving this first year.\" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\"\n\n\n\nAlas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.\n\n\n\nOver the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework \"to fix our broken immigration system.\" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a \"a very important step.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. \"In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we\"ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,\" said Obama.\n\n\n\nObama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Unless the White House has a time machine that we don't know about, this is a Promise Broken."}

Whenever there\u2019s something the G.O.P. doesn\u2019t like \u2014 say, environmental protection \u2014 Heritage can be counted on to produce a report, based on no economic model anyone else recognizes, claiming that this policy would cause huge job losses. Correspondingly, whenever there\u2019s something Republicans want, like tax cuts for the wealthy or for corporations, Heritage can be counted on to claim that this policy would yield immense economic benefits.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe point is that the two parties don\u2019t just live in different moral universes, they also live in different intellectual universes, with Republicans in particular having a stable of supposed experts who reliably endorse whatever they propose.\n\nSo when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where\u2019s the common ground?\n\nEventually, of course, America must choose between these differing visions. And we have a way of doing that. It\u2019s called democracy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But last year the G.O.P. ran against what it called the \u201cmassive Medicare cuts\u201d contained in the health reform law. How, then, can the election have provided a mandate for a plan that not only would preserve all of those cuts, but would go on, over time, to dismantle Medicare completely?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, polls suggest that the public\u2019s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that\u2019s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.\n\nWhich brings me to those calls for a bipartisan solution. Sorry to be cynical, but right now \u201cbipartisan\u201d is usually code for assembling some conservative Democrats and ultraconservative Republicans \u2014 all of them with close ties to the wealthy, and many who are wealthy themselves \u2014 and having them proclaim that low taxes on high incomes and drastic cuts in social insurance are the only possible solution.\n\nThis would be a corrupt, undemocratic way to make decisions about the shape of our society even if those involved really were wise men with a deep grasp of the issues. It\u2019s much worse when many of those at the table are the sort of people who solicit and believe the kind of policy analyses that the Heritage Foundation supplies.\n\nSo let\u2019s not be civil. Instead, let\u2019s have a frank discussion of our differences. In particular, if Democrats believe that Republicans are talking cruel nonsense, they should say so \u2014 and take their case to the voters."}

Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy.\n\nWhen asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by \"due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share.\"\n\nCBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: \"Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?\"\n\n\"We haven't come up with an exact number yet,\" Sanders responded. \"But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent.\"\n\nBernie Sanders on universal healthcare, taxing the rich and taking on Clinton\n\nAs an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: \"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\"\n\nSanders went on to say that his administration would \"end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president.\"\n\nIn fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's administration. This was the second-highest tax rate during the 20th century, following the 94 percent instituted by President Roosevelt during World War II for those making over $200,000 annually.\n\nIn 1954, under Eisenhower, the rate for the highest income bracket decreased to 91 percent.\n\nTaking into account these income tax rates, Sanders' assertion that he's not as \"socialist\" as Eisenhower's administration is correct: Sanders has said before that he doesn't believe his tax policy would tax the top bracket over 90 percent, though he has yet to offer up an exact number.\n\nAppearing on \"CBS This Morning\" in September, Sanders said \"We are going to ask the wealthiest people in this country who are doing phenomenally well, and many large corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits and not paying a nickel in taxes, to in fact start paying their fair share of taxes.\"\n\nWhen asked to specify, the Vermont senator said of taxing those in the highest income bracket, \"I don't think you have to go up to 90 percent.\"\n\nSanders, however, has also called for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's tenure.\n\nDuring Saturday's debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended asking the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes.\n\n\"Under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent,\" he pointed out.\n\nO'Malley is also correct on this point: Under President Reagan, those with annual incomes over $215,400 were taxed at a rate of 69.1 percent."}

This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.\n\nPELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.\n\nOur president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.\n\nI persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.\n\nAMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.\n\nPELOSI: No.\n\nAMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.\n\nPELOSI: Right.\n\nAMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?\n\nPELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.\n\nAMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?\n\nPELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?\n\nPELOSI: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is it worth it?\n\nPELOSI: That's the question.\n\nAMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.\n\nPELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.\n\nAMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?\n\nPELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.\n\nSecondly, governance and ending corruption.....\n\nAMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, \"Time\" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.\n\nYou know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?\n\nPELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.\n\nWhen I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.\n\nAnd we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.\n\nSo what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governance\n\nAMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forces\n\nBIDEN SOT--- \"it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition\"\n\nDoes that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops?\n\nPELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel.\n\nHow does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.?\n\nPELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House?\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will and\n\nAMANPOUR: No matter what happens?\n\nPELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority.\n\nYou had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen?\n\nPELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nfrom outsiders perspective....\n\nAMANPOUR: -- because many people are asking that --\n\nPELOSI: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority?\n\nPELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch.\n\nso we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November?\n\nPELOSI: No, I'm not nervous at all --\n\nAMANPOUR: Not at all?\n\nPELOSI: No. I'm -- I'm --\n\nAMANPOUR: Because people say I know you're putting on a great face --has you have to\n\nPELOSI: -- that's not.\n\nAMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November.\n\nPELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward.\n\nAMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority?\n\nPELOSI: Well, I -- you know, I --\n\nAMANPOUR: well how do you feel about it\n\nPELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another.\n\nAMANPOUR: But it directly impacts --\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that.\n\nBut you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two to one advantage money-wise\n\nSo we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts.\n\nAre you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class?\n\nPELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\nAMANPOUR: But I know that's your position, but\n\nPELOSI: Yes\n\nAMANPOUR: -- to the middle class --\n\nPELOSI: But to keep the middle class tax cuts--\n\nAMANPOUR: Would you take this to a vote before the election\n\nPELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. most people dont realize that\n\nThe Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I show you something?\n\nPELOSI: Sure.\n\nAMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial.\n\nTV AD//RIGHTCHANGE.COM (TAKE VIDEO CLIP FULL) AD NATS\n\nAMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it?\n\nPELOSI: I have not seen that, but I have seen that in campaigns there is\n\nAMANPOUR: So what do you think --\n\nAMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman?\n\nPELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi.\n\nAMANPOUR but it was you\n\nPELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. And as they have said, their agenda, if they win, is to go to the exact agenda of the previous administration and people will look with fondness on the Bush administration....we welcome that campaign\n\nAMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation.\n\nPELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority.\n\nThis isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone has I wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight.\n\nAMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nPELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to \"This Week\".\n\nGATES: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks.\n\nHow can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing?\n\nGATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission.\n\nSo -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S.\n\nAMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases?\n\nGATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.\n\nAnd so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information.\n\nAMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it?\n\nGATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk.\n\nAnd -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people.\n\nAre you worried?\n\nI mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands?\n\nGATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences.\n\nAMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles.\n\nDo they, do you think?\n\nGATES: I don't think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: At all?\n\nGATES: I don't think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan.\n\nHow much of a problem is that for you?\n\nGATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge.\n\nBut what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are.\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told \"The Washington Post\" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate.\n\nSo unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan?\n\nGATES: Well, I think we can but --\n\nAMANPOUR: Even if the safe havens --\n\nGATES: -- but we clearly --\n\nAMANPOUR: -- exist?\n\nGATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily.\n\nAnd so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda.\n\nAMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan?\n\nGATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here.\n\nAMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know.\n\nThe Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock.\n\nLet me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011.\n\nBut my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game?\n\nWhat can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. So I think that --\n\nAMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar. It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working. But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there.\n\nDo you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important?\n\nGATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed.\n\nProbably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here?\n\nI think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right.\n\nGATES: It's pretty straightforward.\n\nAMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now?\n\nLet me put that up.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that it?\n\nGATES: That's good.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that the war?\n\nGATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective.\n\nWe are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan.\n\nBut doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do.\n\nAMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban?\n\nGATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government.\n\nAMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year?\n\nGATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition.\n\nAMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nGATES: Thanks a lot.\n\nAMANPOUR: Thank you.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, has published 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak in history.\n\nGIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I'm a combative person, so I wanted (inaudible)\n\nMULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shaken up Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that and more on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning, Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on the Taliban.\n\nThank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first, George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? And how bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it does with state secrets?\n\nWILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in the sense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sources themselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like the Pentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the government internally had a very different understanding of what was going on in Vietnam than it was saying publicly.\n\nThat's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about what we all knew from good journalism and honest government about this.\n\nWhat we're left with now is still the question of the mission. In your interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: \"We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan.\" Notice the preposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there.\n\nAnd National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have to be there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plot and train.\n\nAMANPOUR: Exactly.\n\nWILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot in this kind of war anywhere.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material and information that came out of that could affect the war?\n\nRASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any really major new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has been quite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simply because this war has not really been properly followed by the public.\n\nThe media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people are being quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that have come out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Now there is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going to follow up on.\n\nAMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You know already they have said that they're going to be searching and scouring this treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going to be bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really been helping the United States?\n\nRASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaks are quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may be false names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly this is something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates in the West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in the Congress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many of the Democrats seem to be voting against the war.\n\nThey are expert now at following up. And if there are people to be followed up upon, they will do so.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to Paul Krugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Western press, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to think that or not, media operation.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page, the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this war right now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy.\n\nI think this will give the administration an opportunity to once again talk about the mission, before December, when the president has announced that he intends to reassess what they're doing.\n\nI also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan's involvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is still up to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing the police and the army. It raises a serious question about going forward and the timetable.\n\nKRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, we can't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead.\n\nAnd now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility.\n\nAMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had this big strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, for instance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo to President Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011 deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable for the United States?\n\nWILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gates semi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 -- 2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairly elastic deadline.\n\nBut look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender, and, B, the normal Afghan would say, \"Give me a third choice, because I don't like the Afghan government, either.\"\n\nAMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that the Taliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on the terms of the Karzai government?\n\nRASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate that takes place within the Obama administration come December, when the policy review takes place, because the other position to this is that, in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon as possible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try and bring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks.\n\nThe Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talking to so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americans directly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set by America, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and open talks, and they would have to continue for some time.\n\nSo I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, then you, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, \"Now, look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. The surges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give a deadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders.\"\n\nIn other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safe havens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will also have a limited timeframe.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particular issue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote in the House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come out and speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she said to me. Listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that's what they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase -- create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, is the number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there is these huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now, all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effect stimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is it deficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go and what does it mean to people?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot of confusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearing any clear message.\n\nYou know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in this debate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were -- one side, the inflationistas, have said, \"Oh, god, we have this -- we have budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to have inflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high.\"\n\nThe deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a major financial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is too small, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants to spend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation.\n\nSo far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What's interesting is that the political debate is being dominated by the people who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said, well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a -- more than a year low just now.\n\nBut they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to be afraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on.\n\nBut this is a -- there is this problem that people have got this austerity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actually happening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because it appeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to make people suffer even more.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the gross domestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.\n\nYou're shaking your head.\n\nWILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right about this. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone.\n\nSecond, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.\n\nSo what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift.\n\nKRUGMAN: Exactly.\n\nWILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel, clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creating jobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on the promise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has averted the Great Depression 2.0.\n\nAnd going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past, going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economic growth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether or not the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January or let some of them stay on the table.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she said she hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before the midterms. Is that likely?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on the House side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They're going to campaign on what they've accomplished.\n\nBut I think when they return, they're going to have to turn back toward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince the voters out there that they've done something to provide economic growth for the future.\n\nKRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would have done in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're not looking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard for an administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, \"It could have been worse,\" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actually could have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well.\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I...\n\nWILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today.\n\nWILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the government is dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side with people like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time for austerity, and this is it.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can...\n\nAMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damage here with some pretty bad statistics. But...\n\nAMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmed about this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what's happening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people in Pakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- does this even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the fact that the money is shorter?\n\nRASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people are fully aware that the continuation of the American presence in Afghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if you like, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in the autumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will be completed, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decide what his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policy review.\n\nAnd all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effective or uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen the vote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if the vote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn against the war?\n\nAMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though, right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democrats made a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have an ethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many people said. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of days over the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity, and my hope is, is that happens.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to just step down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would do that. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to have his day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answer to some of these charges.\n\nAgain, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano, but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like to have their day to clear their names.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty...\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, well, they...\n\nAMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement?\n\nKRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask -- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. There are actually two major investigations of members of Congress underway right now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty, although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator John Ensign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it's even a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever on the Ensign investigation.\n\nWhy is Rangel getting all this attention?\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that fair, George?\n\nWILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman of an important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a national misfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficit commission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reform in this country. That requires a cooperative member leading that committee in the House.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficit commission, it would matter, but it's not.\n\nWILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strong position. His strong position is the president and everyone wants this thing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, and therefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, a reprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here.\n\nKRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, but I was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given so much corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thank you all so much for joining us.\n\nAnd the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks.

It's all thanks to Russia's offer of a diplomatic solution, even though it's a phony one. Nevertheless, the president's team is more than happy to take credit for it.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKERRY: Well, it's the credible threat of force that has been on the table for these last weeks that has, for the first time, brought this regime to even acknowledge that they have a chemical weapons arsenal.\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: This is a victory for President Obama, if it is real.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUPP: Van, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is ready to order the \"mission accomplished\" banner. Look, everyone wants to parachute out of this conflict. I get that. But the Russians have offered us not a parachute but a knapsack. A knapsack that will never open. This is nothing more than a delay tactic.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, I disagree. First of all, I think the world is rightfully happy that we are off the path to war, possibly. The diplomatic option is a good thing. And frankly, everybody is giving John Kerry a hard time. I would rather for us to blunder on the path to peace than to stumble onto the path of war.\n\n\n\nCUPP: If this were proposal -- if this proposal were real and offered up by legitimate, good actors, I would be happy to consider it.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, welcome to the real world, where you don't get the chance to pick who offers you a solution to this thing.\n\n\n\nLook, we've got two former presidential candidates and two former senators -- both the same person -- tonight on CROSSFIRE to help us with this thing.\n\n\n\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR: Two friends, I might add. And two friends.\n\n\n\nJONES: And two friends. Republican Rick Santorum is against attacking Syria. Democratic former senator, now independent, Joe Lieberman, he supports the strike.\n\n\n\nThe first question to you. You've got to be happy now. We've got a big diplomatic opening. You've got to be on President Obama's team now. You're happy, right?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Leading question.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If there's not going to be a military attack, that's a good thing. So if the president is willing to step down for whatever reason, look, he -- he went to the Congress because he didn't want to do this. If he wanted to do it, he'd said he had the power to do it. And he just decided not to.\n\n\n\nWhen you consider the fact that, whether it's on immigration or health care or on DOMA or on a whole variety of things --\n\n\n\nJONES: But are you --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- he's done things that he doesn't have the power to do. Now he has the power to do something, and he went to Congress. So it's clear he didn't want to do this.\n\n\n\nJONES: You're on team Obama now.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I'm on team \"let's not broaden this war and put a much more complicated diplomatic situation and military situation in the hands of someone who's proved incapable of handling the situation.\"\n\n\n\nJONES: We'll argue about that later.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Lieberman, why after two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?\n\n\n\nJOE LIEBERMAN (I), FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR: Well, I wish we were not pausing. I mean, I think President Obama made the right moral decision when he drew the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- and then when he said, after we had proof that chemical weapons were used to kill almost 1,500 innocents, including 426 children by Assad in Syria, that he was going to take military action.\n\n\n\nI was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it. If he had, I think the American people would have been happy now that he had done it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Should he attack now? Should he attack now without Congress?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I -- well, I think, now that Russia has made this offer, even though it's hard to take it seriously coming from Russia which hasn't been our friend -- just look at the Snowden matter.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Look at Syria, where Assad -- John Kerry said correctly last week that he tried very hard to reach an agreement with Assad years ago as a senator and decided he was a liar.\n\n\n\nJONES: But you're not saying we should through this peace offering in the garbage can and then -- and then attack now. Is that what you're saying?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No, I'm saying that it's hard to take the proposal by Russia seriously, but it's important enough that we've got to challenge them to be serious about it and see if Syria really will, with international supervision and penalties, get rid of all their chemical weapons. If they did that, it would be a tremendous accomplishment.\n\n\n\nBut I think the president still has to face the fact, if nothing happens, that there was a chemical attack --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The bottom line is here we have no national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We don't have any national security interests when children are being chemically --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Then we should be in Darfur. Then we should be in 50 other countries around the world.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not a reason.\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about al Qaeda?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I wish -- I wish -- that is the point. The point is we have no set national security interest, because the two sides of this conflict are both enemies of the United States. We have al Qaeda, who is basically the dominant rebel force right now, on one side and we have on the other side Hezbollah, Iran, Russia and Assad. JONES: I don't understand what you want to do, though. Here's my problem. You are a leader on Syria. You are a big supporter and, frankly, the author of the Syrian Accountability Act.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I was.\n\n\n\nJONES: And now you seem to have completely disappeared. What is it that you think that should happen? I want to show you -- show you these images that have shocked the world. Can we show these images?\n\n\n\nLook at these children. They're twitching. They're dying. What if one of the mothers of one of those children called this station right now and said to you, \"Why won't you help me? Why won't you help my children?\" You're saying there's no interest in doing that.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The reason the United States -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this. We may disagree on where we come out, but the reason the United States uses military forces for one reason and one reason only. It's in our national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We have no moral obligation?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation. We have other obligations.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look, what -- but what can we do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We need to get involved. We need to -- the Syrian Accountability Act was about political sanctions. It was about economic sanctions. It was no trip wire for military force. And when the president used the Syrian Accountability Act as reasons for Congress to support him, he misled the American public on that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: As the author, I know that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, I know you. We go back a little ways. We've had some conservations about faith and morality and values, social conservatism. I don't understand -- help me understand -- how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How -- how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: They're fighting for their freedom, incidentally, which is what America's supposed to be all about.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes. And how -- aren't you worried this will be another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: This didn't start out as al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I agree. And I called for military force 18 months ago.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right. As did I. As did I.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I met with the opposition. And there -- these were patriots, Syrian patriots, freedom fighters --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- who were sick of the dictator.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We held back and al Qaeda came in. I don't think al Qaeda is the dominant force in the opposition. I think from all I know it's the Syrian people who want to change from Assad. And they deserve --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: I want to give him a chance to say something, because listen, I want to double down on peace. I don't want to double down on war. I think that we have diplomatic options we haven't exhausted. My quarrel with the president all week long has been we're rushing to war.\n\n\n\nBut my problem is, I want to double down on peace; some people want to double down on war. It seems like you're doubling down on nothing. What do you want us to do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's -- let's --\n\n\n\nJONES: If you were the president, what would you do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Well, first off, go back and look at the debates that occurred about 18 months ago. And I, in those debates, called for the president to intervene, to side with exactly the people that Joe Lieberman was talking about, and get involved, give them --\n\n\n\nJONES: So we had an interest then, but we don't have an interest now?\n\n\n\nHold on a second. How do we have an interest then and not now?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Everything has changed.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Everything has changed. Everything has changed. The people who are the rebels in Syria right now are not the same people that we --\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That we could have been partners with 18 months ago.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But it's not going to get better if we hang back. I mean, if we get involved in one level and support the moderates there -- and there are moderates there who are our friends -- then they'll have a better opportunity to control the country when Assad goes.\n\n\n\nRight now, I think we've got to hang tough. And tonight, the president's got a real challenge, but -- because of all of the twists and turns of the story -- but he's got a great opportunity to tell people why he thinks it's worth us carrying out limited but decisive attacks. CUPP: What does he need to say tonight? What does he need to say tonight?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Well, I think he needs to say, one, we can't -- we can't handle every problem in the world. But Americans, you know, we have a Declaration of Independence that talks about the self-evident truth that everybody -- not just Americans but in the world -- got from our creator the rights to life and liberty. And these people in Syria have been deprived of both of those rights.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the point. If you let a dictator mass murder his people and you turn away from it, he's going to keep going. And every other madman is going to keep going.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Sure. And haven't we learned this lesson?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Two different -- two different lessons. First off, there are lot -- there are lots of dictators, unfortunately, in this world who are mass murdering their people. We've seen it. We've seen it under President Obama. We saw it under President Bush. It's under presidents for decades now. The United States has not stepped in unless there's a national security interest military. We've stepped in in other ways, but we have not stepped in militarily.\n\n\n\nBut the president is going to change that and say that humanitarian reasons and the reason we're going to step in and -- and engage in military conflict. We are broadening -- you want to talk about not being a cop on the beat. You want to talk about something you and folks that -- that have been advocating for us to have -- make peace not war. We've now opened up Pandora's box as to military use. It's a bad idea. It's not in the security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: I want -- I want you to respond to this. My quarrel with the president is I think he did two things right and one thing wrong. I think he was right to say this is an outrage, and we're not going to let babies get gassed.\n\n\n\nCUPP: And then do nothing about it?\n\n\n\nJONES: I think that was right. I think he was wrong to rush into a war posture without talking to Congress, without bringing in the U.N., without bringing a global coalition, without exhausting --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: He did that when he set the red line, with Russia. And he set the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Months ago.\n\n\n\nJONES: And he did -- and I think he did. Because he waited -- and I'm surprised you say you wish we'd gone in -- because he waited, we now have a new opening.\n\n\n\nDo you disagree that the president, by putting those warships out there and waiting, don't you agree he created an opening now for peace? You're saying that the president has done nothing right this whole crisis?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If we believe Putin and Assad are legitimate actors in the diplomatic stage. Well, but that's who's come forward, and it's not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: It's who we got.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It's who we got. And so, look, I'm perfectly willing to let this play out. I want us to not strike Syria --\n\n\n\nJONES: You and me both.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- because I think streaking Syria, at this point in time, will create a real problem for us militarily with Russia, with potentially others in the region.\n\n\n\nWe are taking -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this one. The whole Syria conflict at this point, has taken our eye off the ball. And the ball is Iran. Syria is a puppet state of Iran.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: That's exactly the reason why we can't let Assad get away.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right. Iran is watching.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: It's the biggest body blow we could land to Iran. He's their only ally in the Arab world. And this -- even this proposal, which if it works for Russia, will be a good thing. The price of it will be that Assad will stay there, and Iran will still have its No. 1 ally in the Arab world.\n\n\n\nCUPP: All right. Well, let's -- let's continue this over in the next -- in the next segment. There are a lot of creative solutions that don't involve bombing and killing people apparently.\n\n\n\nYes, there are and we'll talk about it when we get back. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nTonight President Obama addresses the nation about Syria. He's hitting the pause button on the military strikes. That gives us time for some creative solutions. And we should keep the warships parked off of there. But what about helping refugees? What about an arms embargo? What about cyber-attacks, what about anything? It's all either war or nothing.\n\n\n\nI'm going to ask you: If there were a dome over Syria, so it was not about bomb or don't bomb, what are some of the creative things we could do that don't involve war? How do we win without war?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Unfortunately, if there were a dome over Syria, there was nothing we could do to stop the bloodshed. Because you've got a basically unfair fight here. The government has most of the fire power. Finally, the patriots, the freedom fighter Syrians, have gotten help from outside. But they're still getting decimated. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: This is America. You're saying there's nothing we can do? It's either Tomahawk missiles or nothing? We're the most creative --\n\n\n\nCUPP: But the dome doesn't exist, Van. The dome is fantasy land. Let's deal with reality.\n\n\n\nJONES: The fact -- let's get with reality. We have someone here --\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Let me say something about the dome. Because the other reason it's gone --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Van Jones Dome.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The dome is unreal, but what that really reminds us of is that their neighbors there -- Israel, Iraq, Jordan -- they're all being -- Lebanon -- they're all being badly affected by what's going on in Syria. Our allies are.\n\n\n\nJONES: This is a crisis in our country, of imagination. How can we get out of this without bombs. You tell us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That's why -- that's why Rick Santorum, 18 months ago, during the presidential campaign --\n\n\n\nJONES: Today.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- said we should be arming the rebels.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That's right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We should be supporting them militarily. We should be supporting them economically. We should be doing everything --\n\n\n\nJONES: That's all in the past.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We agree --\n\n\n\nJONES: And now we give up. Because we didn't do what you wanted so we just give up.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Because a lot of folks -- hello?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hello?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A lot of folks said no, we had no interest in this.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hey, listen.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Do you admit you were wrong?\n\n\n\nJONES: I'll tell you what: I'm going to shock you. I think the Democrats were wrong for not taking Syria more seriously earlier. But I think it's wrong, and I'm giving you an opportunity. I don't want to go to war. I think there are a lot of things we could do that would get us out of the situation without war. You are somebody who's got some ideas about it, but I don't hear anybody talking about what can we do.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator, you've said Assad -- Assad has to go. You've said Assad has to go. How do you do it without military intervention?\n\n\n\nJONES: What can we do?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: This is very difficult right now. When you look at the rebels and the composition of the rebel forces, you see -- you're seeing on YouTube how rebel forces are, you know -- these radical al- Qaeda folks are killing off other rebel leaders and are doing atrocities to the public also.\n\n\n\nJONES: But if you were president --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You are going to say we are going to come on the side of them and help them.\n\n\n\nJONES: That's terrible. Help us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: But we can't. No, what we have to do is do what we should have done from the very beginning, which is let's identify, as we can, and support and protect and defend the legitimate elements within the rebel forces. Begin the process of arming them, protecting them, et cetera.\n\n\n\nJONES: You agree with this?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I totally agree. I just want to say something. You've been using the word \"war.\" Nobody's talking about war. President Obama's not talking about war. He's not talking about any American boots on the ground. He's talking about limited, decisive attacks.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because you are not that naive, Senator Lieberman. You know that, even though President Obama is saying no boots on the ground, if one of our planes goes down, we're sending boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Yes, but that -- everybody's --\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a lot bigger conflict than he thinks.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I don't believe so. It's not going to be a massive land invasion.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, what the president could have done when he decided to send it to Congress in taking the military action limited that he has in mind, is not a precedent. President Reagan did it in Grenada and struck at Libya when he thought the Libyans blew up a disco in Germany.\n\n\n\nYou know, President Clinton went into Bosnia, and people could argue we had no national security interests there, but a lot of people were getting slaughtered --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- by the Serbs at that point. And it goes on and on. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: I'm glad the president went to Congress. I think the president going to Congress is the best thing that happened, because it gave us time. You don't agree with me.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No. Here's my concern when he did it. I don't think he had to do it. He himself said, and I think he was right, that he had the legal authority to take action himself as commander in chief under the War Powers Resolution, everything else. He took an enormous risk, and unfortunately, he's in a quagmire now, because the risk was that Congress would say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, now they're both being delayed, and the U.N. is -- the U.N. is now a forum where -- I don't understand why you can say it's a bad thing. The delay gave us time.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Don't worry. The U.N.'s on it.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You may have not seen the polls. I'm not a great poll- watcher. But the American public is overwhelmingly against the president. The president's been making this case now for several weeks. They are against military action. They do not see any positive benefit for the United States in getting involved in a war between two radical elements of which neither are our friends.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Now I want to -- I want to quote you -- I'm quoting from the New Testament, Corinthians: \"When the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?\" So I think people are so confused about what's going on here. If --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The president says he has to do it, but then he goes to Congress.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: If you looked at the polls earlier, there was authority for a limited strike without American boots on the ground, particularly if we had some support from other --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you, Senator -- go ahead.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Here's the president says we need to do it, but I'm going to ask Congress. We need to strike, but it's not going to be decisive. Of course, the American people is going to say what the heck are we doing here?\n\n\n\nBecause here's the problem: If we actually do act, and if the Russians or the Iranians or somebody else say, \"You know what? You've drawn a line in the sand for us and we're going to -- we're going to act back,\" now we've put the United States in a much broader war with a president who is clearly over his head.\n\n\n\nJONES: Listen, I don't -- I do not agree the president is in over his head. First of all, let's be clear. This is a president who built a -- he built a coalition to --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Really?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let me finish. He isolated Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A coalition?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let's walk through the list before we take him down too hard. He got -- he got Russia and China to be with us against Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop right there. Stop. Whoa!\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Forget Libya.\n\n\n\nJONES: Libya.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop at Iran. Is Iran pursuing the nuclear weapons program? They have not drawn down.\n\n\n\nJONES: The answer is -- Do you want a war? Do you want a war?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line.\n\n\n\nJONES: Yes. We're doing cyber-attacks. We're doing an embargo.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line with Iran, and we have done nothing publicly.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you. This is a very good opportunity --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a very good opportunity -- very good opportunity to talk about the U.N. The U.N. -- no one, maybe except Van, trusts the Russians in this new plan to seize chemical weapons from Assad. But I fear that a lot of people trust the U.N. to do that.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. does not have a terribly impressive track record when it comes to ending conflicts. Are you worried? Should the American people trust U.N. to oversee this new Russian plan?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The U.N. works sometimes. Other times it doesn't. The record is mixed. The question is what passes in the U.N.? If, as France --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, nothing if you're Russia and China.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: France tabled a resolution in the Security Council today that basically embraced the Russian proposal that the Syrians get rid of their chemical weapons with international supervision and said that, if they didn't, then force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council. I thought that was great, because it called -- called Russia's bluff.\n\n\n\nAnd what do you think Russia did? They said that was unacceptable. They don't want a mandatory resolution with teeth in it. They want it to be a presidential statement of kind of appealing to Syria.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It calls into question Russia's credibility with this entire proposal.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Do you trust -- wait, let me ask. Do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Pick an issue. The answer is no.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Exactly right.\n\n\n\nJONES: A hundred and seventy-two successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations for some. Listen, we always focus -- 172 --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia --\n\n\n\nJONES: The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That is not -- that is a total inaccuracy.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look right here: 172 peacekeeping --\n\n\n\nCUPP: I have a list, too, of atrocities that they have taken responsibility for and not changed. The world feels very good about itself when it allows the U.N. to take over, because it feels like it's doing something. It's false security.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, listen -- Here's what I don't understand. When George W. Bush brought in the United Nations, people thought that was a good thing. He was trying to bring in the global community. I thought that you wanted us to build a big global coalition. I think we have a moment now to do so.\n\n\n\nAnd why do we have it? We have it for two reasons. One, he went to Congress, which you don't like. And two, because as much as we do not trust the Russians for their own interests, they are moving. Why are you mad at Congress and the U.N.?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Name -- name the countries that are for the United States getting involved militarily in Syria.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, apparently, there's France. Militarily?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The people that want us to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: You can answer that.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: There's about 15 that signed that statement calling for action.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Action but not military action.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But you know what? The president has --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: There's a big difference between action and military action. I'm for action. I'm just not for -- I'm not for a military strike. Particularly one that's not decisive and is not going to accomplish anything.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the problem. I think a military strike today will hurt Assad. I think that's the reason why, at least in words, he's accepted this Russian proposal.\n\n\n\nI don't believe him for a minute. I'll believe it when I see it, when he gives us his chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But I think he's scared of a strike. We're going to hit his command and control.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out. We strike Assad. We -- we knock out a few command and control operations. Then where do we go?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Then we give more support to the Syrian opposition. Because they will have a tremendous boost in morale.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Why can't we do that without striking?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We can, but we've got to strike him because he used chemical weapons. And if we don't, then he'll use them again.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: And you don't have any -- you don't have any fear or concern that any other country will, as a result of us striking Syria, do something to -- to insert themselves even in that conflict or potentially against the United States?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: They might but you know, when you're -- we can't -- we can't act out of fear of what might happen. We're strong. We're still the strongest country in the world.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We're not. We're not acting like -- we're not acting like a leader. We're not acting strong. We're acting like someone who said, don't knock this off my shoulder and you do. And so I -- OK, so I've got a fight back. We have to have --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The shoulder was the high moral ground about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It wasn't a high moral ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Assad have used chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons -- LIEBERMAN: You've got to say no.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons is very different than WMD that Iran is working on. That's where we should focus our attention.\n\n\n\nCUPP: OK. Thanks to Joe Lieberman and Rick Santorum. It was a great debate. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nNext, we \"Cease Fire.\" There's something important here we need to agree on. Not just the two of us but the whole country.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, we've been debating and fighting about what to do about Syria. But now we're going to call a \"Cease Fire.\"\n\n\n\nNow I think, and I want to come back to a point I made. I think that I have to admit that you guys have been right about something. You guys have been out, you in particular, out there for two years saying we've got to do something about Syria, something about Syria.\n\n\n\nI hate your solution.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes.\n\n\n\nJONES: I don't like the war. But you are pointing to the right problem. And I think a lot of people on the left were ducking it, and we weren't dealing with it. And I think that what my lesson out of this is, even when we don't agree, we've got to listen to each other more than we did.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, and I appreciate that. And I will return a favor and say, look, I don't agree with your solutions either, but at least you've been consistent. I think a lot of Democrats and liberals have talked about President Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to President Bush's. And you hold Obama to the same standard as you hold President Bush, and that -- that says a lot about your credibility.\n\n\n\nJONES: Here we go. The two of us, we agreed, and the world didn't come to an end.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Here's another thing we agree on: Your opinion matters. You can weigh in on our \"Fire Back\" question via Facebook or Twitter. \"Should the U.S. trust Russia's offer to rid Syria of chemical weapons?\" Right now 41 percent of you say yes; 59 percent say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: The debate continues online at CNN.com/crossfire. You can also go to Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\nFrom the left, I'm Van Jones.\n\n\n\nCUPP: and from the right, I'm S.C. Cupp. Join us tomorrow for another edition of CROSSFIRE.\n\n\n\nA special edition of \"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" starts right now.\n\n\n\n"}

I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service.\n\nTonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic, since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.\n\nBy coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate - and right now, as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. OK, you got your little wave to the families in.\n\nIt's great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.\n\nI would like to begin with Libya. On a rather somber note, one month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear, there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It - Chris\n\nStevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans.\n\nI can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight. One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever - wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.\n\nWhen you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 - he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.\n\nWith regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, \"My highest priority is to get bin Laden.\"\n\nPrior to the election, prior to the - him being sworn in, said, \"I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.\" He didn't understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield. It was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be. And lastly, the president of the United States has - has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nHe went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times - he talked about the YouTube video.\n\nlook, if we're hit by terrorists we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an Al Qaida cell with arms?\n\nThis is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.\n\nWith respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration. Let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement. We don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one. That's what we are talking about.\n\nNow, when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.\n\nNow, with respect to Afghanistan, the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want it do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad, and that's what's happening here.\n\nRYAN: This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself, but unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem. And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the (inaudible) more chaotic us less safe.\n\nRADDATZ: I just want to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and you're talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness; talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?\n\nRYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will - it's never too early to speak out for our values.\n\nWe should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.\n\nAnd we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we're cutting down on defense, it makes us more weak. It projects weakness. And when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks, and are allies are less willing to...\n\n[CROSSTALK]\n\nBIDEN: With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: And why is that so?\n\nBIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all...\n\nRADDATZ: Be specific.\n\nBIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the - this lecture on embassy security - the congressman here cut embassy security in much for the embassy security piece.\n\nNumber two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this - this weakness. I - I don't understand what my friend's talking about here.\n\nWe - this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is a guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating - most devastating - the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop (inaudible).\n\nLook, I - I just - I mean, these guys bet against America all\n\nthe time.\n\nRADDATZ: Can we talk - let me go back to Libya.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah, sure.\n\nRADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why - why\n\nwere people talking about protests? When people in the consulate\n\nfirst saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters.\n\nWhy did that go on (inaudible)?\n\nBIDEN: Because that was exactly what we were told by the\n\nintelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As\n\nthey learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed\n\ntheir assessment. That's why there's also an investigation headed by\n\nTom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing\n\nan investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the\n\nlapses were, so that they will never happen again.\n\nRADDATZ: And they wanted more security there.\n\nBIDEN: Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there.\n\nWe did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at\n\nthe time we were told exactly - we said exactly what the intelligence\n\ncommunity told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as\n\nthe intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they\n\nchanged their view.\n\nThat's why I said we will get to the bottom of this. You know,\n\nusually when there's a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as\n\na nation. But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the\n\nambassador, the governor was holding a press conference - was holding\n\na press conference. That's not presidential leadership.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about - the Romney\n\ncampaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called called\n\n\"No Apologies.\" Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning\n\nKorans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines\n\nurinating on Taliban corpses?\n\nRYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we\n\nshould not apologize for...\n\nRADDATZ: Burning Korans, immediately?\n\nRYAN: What - what we should not be apologizing for are standing\n\nup for our values. What we should not be doing is saying to the\n\nEgyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on them, that he's a\n\ngood guy and, in the next week, say he ought to go.\n\nWhat we should not be doing is rejecting claims for - for calls\n\nfor more security in our barracks, in our Marine - we need Marines in\n\nBenghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for\n\nsecurity. There were requests for extra security; those requests were\n\nnot honored.\n\nLook, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It was Libya, a country\n\nwe knew we had Al Qaida cells there, as we know Al Qaida and its\n\naffiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa. And we did not give\n\nour ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment?\n\nOf course there's an investigation, so we can make sure that this\n\nnever happens again, but when it comes to speaking up for our values,\n\nwe should not apologize for those. Here's the problem. Look at all\n\nthe various issues out there, and it's unraveling before our eyes.\n\nThe vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got - we've\n\nhad four...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to Iran. I'd actually like to move to Iran,\n\nbecause there's really no bigger national security...\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nRADDATZ: ... this country is facing. Both President Obama and\n\nGovernor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a\n\nnuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week, former\n\nDefense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran's facilities would\n\nnot work and, quote, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for\n\ngenerations.\" Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to\n\nthe American people how effective would a military strike be?\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.\n\nNow, let's take a look at where we've gone - come from. When Barack\n\nObama was elected, they had enough fissile material - nuclear\n\nmaterial to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They're\n\nracing toward a nuclear weapon. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapons capability.\n\nWe've had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from\n\nthe Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is\n\nbecause Russia watered it down and prevented the - the sanctions from\n\nhitting the central bank.\n\nMitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I've\n\nbeen fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was\n\nblocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong\n\nbipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule\n\ntheir objections and put them in spite of the administration.\n\nImagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in\n\nplace earlier. You think Iran's not brazen? Look at what they're\n\ndoing. They're stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a\n\nterrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to\n\nblow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd talk about credibility? When this administration says that\n\nall options are on the table, they send out senior administration\n\nofficials that send all these mixed signals.\n\nAnd so, in order to solve this peacefully - which is everybody's\n\ngoal - you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at\n\nwhere they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's\n\nbecause this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's\n\nbecause this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions,\n\ntried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place.\n\nNow we have them in place because of Congress. They say the\n\nmilitary option's on the table, but it's not being viewed as credible.\n\nAnd the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have\n\ncredibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility\n\non this issue.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: It's incredible. Look, imagine had we let the Republican\n\nCongress work out the sanctions. You think there's any possibility\n\nthe entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our\n\nallies? These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of\n\nsanctions, period. Period.\n\nthese sanctions.\" When he said, \"Well, you're talking about doing\n\nmore,\" what are you - you're going to go to war? Is that what you\n\nwant to do?\n\nRYAN: We want to prevent war.\n\nBIDEN: And the interesting thing is, how are they going to\n\nprevent war? How are they going to prevent war if they say there's\n\nnothing more that we - that they say we should do than what we've\n\nalready done, number one.\n\nAnd number two, with regard to the ability of the United States\n\nto take action militarily, it is - it is not in my purview to talk\n\nabout classified information. But we feel quite confident we could\n\ndeal a serious blow to the Iranians.\n\nBut number two, the Iranians are - the Israelis and the United\n\nStates, our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the\n\nsame exact place in terms of how close - how close the Iranians are\n\nto getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no\n\ndifference between our view and theirs.\n\nWhen my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take\n\nthis highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they\n\nhave to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon\n\nthat the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know\n\n- we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon.\n\nSo all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk, what are\n\nthey talking about? Are you talking about, to be more credible -\n\nwhat more can the president do, stand before the United Nations, tell\n\nthe whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah, we will not\n\nlet them acquire a nuclear weapon, period, unless he's talking about\n\ngoing to war.\n\nRYAN: Martha? Let's...\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What\n\ndo they see? They see this administration trying to water down\n\nsanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster\n\ntoward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster.\n\nThey see us saying when we come into the administration, when\n\nthey're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see\n\nPresident Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and\n\nhe, instead of meeting with him, goes on a - on a daily talk show.\n\nThey see, when we say that these options are on the table, the\n\nsecretary of defense walked them back.\n\nThey are not changing their mind. That's what we have to do, is\n\nchange their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they're\n\ngoing faster.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do it so quickly? Look, you - you both saw\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb with a red line and\n\ntalking about the red line being in spring. So can you solve this, if\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two months\n\nbefore spring and avoid nuclear - nuclear...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We can debate a time line. We can debate the time line,\n\nwhether there's - it's that short a time or longer. I agree that\n\nit's probably longer.\n\nNumber two, it's all about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You don't agree with that bomb and whether the\n\nIsraelis...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: I don't want to go into classified stuff. But we both\n\nagree that to do this peacefully you've got to get them to change\n\ntheir minds. They're not changing their minds. And look at what this\n\nadministration...\n\nRADDATZ: But what - what do...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.\n\nRYAN: You have to have credibility.\n\nBIDEN: The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. The\n\nayatollah sees that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. He\n\nsees the currency going into the tank. He sees the economy going into\n\nfreefall. And he sees the world for the first time totally united in\n\nopposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nNow, with regard to Bibi, who's been my friend 39 years, the\n\npresident has met with Bibi a dozen times. He's spoken to Bibi\n\nNetanyahu as much as he's spoken to anybody. The idea that we're not\n\n- I was in a, just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference\n\ncall with the - with the president, with him talking to Bibi for well\n\nover an hour, in - in - in stark relief and detail of what was going\n\non.\n\nThis is a bunch of stuff. Look, here's the deal.\n\nRADDATZ: What does that mean, a bunch of stuff?\n\nBIDEN: Well, it means it's simply inaccurate.\n\nRYAN: It's Irish.\n\nBIDEN: It - it is.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe Irish call it malarkey.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: We Irish call it malarkey. But last thing. The\n\nsecretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didn't walk\n\nanything back. We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear\n\nweapon. What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where\n\nthey can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon. They don't have\n\na weapon to put it into.\n\nLet's all calm down a little bit here. Iran is more isolated\n\ntoday than when we took office. It was on the ascendancy when we took\n\noffice. It is totally isolated.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know what world this guy's living in.\n\nRYAN: Thank heavens we had these sanctions in place. It's in\n\nspite of their opposition.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, god.\n\nRYAN: They've given 20 waivers to this sanction. And all I have\n\nto point to are the results. They're four years closer toward a\n\nnuclear weapon. I think that case speaks for itself.\n\nRADDATZ: Can you tell the American people...\n\nBIDEN: By the way, they...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: What's worse, another war in the Middle East...\n\nBIDEN: ... they are not four years closer to a nuclear weapon.\n\nRYAN: Of course they are.\n\nBIDEN: They're - they're closer to being able to get enough\n\nfissile material to put in a weapon if they had a weapon.\n\nRADDATZ: You are acting a little bit like they don't want one.\n\nBIDEN: Oh, I didn't say - no, I'm not saying that. But facts\n\nmatter, Martha. You're a foreign policy expert. Facts matter. All\n\nthis loose talk about them, \"All they have to do is get to enrich\n\nuranium in a certain amount and they have a weapon,\" not true. Not\n\ntrue.\n\nThey are more - and if we ever have to take action, unlike when\n\nwe took office, we will have the world behind us, and that matters.\n\nThat matters.\n\nRADDATZ: What about Bob Gates' statement? Let me read that\n\nagain, \"could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.\"\n\nBIDEN: He is right. It could prove catastrophic, if we didn't\n\ndo it with precision.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: And what it does is it undermines our credibility by\n\nbacking up the point when we make it that all options are on the\n\ntable. That's the point. The ayatollahs see these kinds of\n\nstatements and they think, \"I'm going to get a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nWhen - when we see the kind of equivocation that took place\n\nbecause this administration wanted a precondition policy, so when the\n\nGreen Revolution started up, they were silent for nine days. When\n\nthey see us putting - when they see us putting daylight between\n\nourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.\n\nWhen they see Russia watering down any further sanctions, the only\n\nreason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down and\n\nprevented these central bank sanctions in the first place. So when\n\nthey see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue, and\n\nthat's the problem.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let me tell you what Russia...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let me ask you what's worse, war in the Middle\n\nEast, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?\n\nRYAN: I'll tell you what's worse. I'll tell you what's worse.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly.\n\nRYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran which triggers a nuclear arms race in\n\nthe Middle East. This is the world's largest sponsor of - of\n\nterrorism. They've dedicated themselves...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... to wiping an entire country off the map. They call us\n\nthe Great Satan. And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the\n\nneighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons, as well.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nRYAN: We can't live with that.\n\nBIDEN: War should always be the absolute last resort. That's\n\nwhy these crippling sanctions, which Bibi Netanyahu says we should\n\ncontinue, which - if I'm not mistaken - Governor Romney says we -\n\nwe should continue. I may be mistaken. He changes his mind so often,\n\nI could be wrong.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, he says they're working. And the\n\nfact is that they are being crippled by them. And we've made it\n\nclear, big nations can't bluff. This president doesn't bluff.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a\n\ndifferent kind of national security issue, the state of our economy.\n\nThe number-one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of\n\nunemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months.\n\nThe Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6\n\npercent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in\n\nstimulus money.\n\nSo will both of you level with the American people: Can you get\n\nunemployment to under 6 percent and how long will it take?\n\nBIDEN: I don't know how long it will take. We can and we will\n\nget it under 6 percent. Let's look at - let's take a look at the\n\nfacts. Let's look at where we were when we came to office. The\n\neconomy was in free fall. We had - the great recession hit; 9\n\nmillion people lost their job; $1.7 - $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in\n\nequity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class.\n\nWe knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went\n\nout and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we\n\ncut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that -\n\nwhen that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, \"No, let Detroit\n\ngo bankrupt.\" We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.\n\nGovernor Romney said, \"No, let foreclosures hit the bottom.\"\n\nBut it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of\n\nthe American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own\n\nlives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said \"30 percent\n\nof the American people are takers.\"\n\nThese people are my mom and dad - the people I grew up with, my\n\nneighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in\n\nhis federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are\n\nliving off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting\n\nin Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \"not paying any tax.\"\n\nI've had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent - it's\n\nabout time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing\n\npledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to\n\ncontribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a\n\npledge saying to the middle class we're going to level the playing\n\nfield; we're going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not\n\nrepeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of\n\nrules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to\n\nhemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy.\n\nBIDEN: They're pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will\n\ngive an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And\n\nthey're holding hostage the middle class tax cut because they say we\n\nwon't pass - we won't continue the middle class tax cut unless you\n\ngive the tax cut for the super wealthy.\n\nIt's about time they take some responsibility.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns. He's from Scranton,\n\nPennsylvania. I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what the\n\nunemployment rate in Scranton is today?\n\nBIDEN: I sure do.\n\nRYAN: It's 10 percent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: You know what it was the day you guys came in - 8.5\n\npercent.\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: That's how it's going all around America.\n\nLook...\n\nBIDEN: You don't read the statistics. That's not how it's\n\ngoing. It's going down.\n\nRADDATZ: (inaudible) two-minute answer (inaudible)\n\nRYAN: Look, did they come in and inherit a tough situation?\n\nAbsolutely. But we're going in the wrong direction. Look at where we\n\nare. The economy is barely limping along. It's growing a 1.3\n\npercent. That's slower than it grew last year and last year was\n\nslower than the year before.\n\nJob growth in September was slower than it was in August, and\n\nAugust was slower than it was in July. We're heading in the wrong\n\ndirection; 23 million Americans are struggling for work today; 15\n\npercent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a\n\nreal recovery looks like.\n\nWe need real reforms for real recovery and that's exactly what\n\nMitt Romney and I are proposing. It's a five-point plan. Get America\n\nenergy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help\n\npeople who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they\n\nwant. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt\n\ncrisis.\n\nMake trade work for America so we can make more things in America\n\nand sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. Don't raise\n\ntaxes on small businesses because they're our job creators.\n\nRYAN: He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney's a car guy. They\n\nkeep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.\n\nThis is a guy who I was talking to a family in Northborough,\n\nMassachusetts the other day, Sheryl and Mark Nixon. Their kids were\n\nhit in a car crash, four of them. Two of them, Rob and Reed, were\n\nparalyzed. The Romneys didn't know them. They went to the same\n\nchurch; they never met before.\n\nboys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, \"I know you're\n\nstruggling, Mark. Don't worry about their college. I'll pay for it.\"\n\nWhen Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney\n\ndoesn't tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told\n\nme this story, he said it wasn't the help, the cash help. It's that\n\nhe gave his time, and he has consistently.\n\nThis is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more\n\nthan the two of us combined. Mitt Romney's a good man. He cares\n\nabout 100 percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to\n\nthat quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes\n\nthe words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBIDEN: But I always say what I mean. And so does Romney.\n\nRYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We want to get people out\n\nof poverty, in the middle class, onto a life of self-sufficiently. We\n\nbelieve in opportunity and upward mobility. That's what we're going\n\nto push for in a Romney administration.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice president? I have a feeling you have a few things\n\nto say here.\n\nBIDEN: The idea - if you heard that - that little soliloquy on\n\n47 percent and you think he just made a mistake, then I think you're\n\n- I - I think - I got a bridge to sell you.\n\nLook, I don't doubt his personal generosity. And I understand\n\nwhat it's like. When I was a little younger than the congressman, my\n\nwife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife, and my two\n\nsons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone\n\nthrough what I get through, because the one thing you can give people\n\nsolace is to know if they know you've been through it, that they can\n\nmake it. So I don't doubt his personal commitment to individuals.\n\nBut you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile\n\nindustry. He just - he said, let it go bankrupt, period. Let it\n\ndrop out. All this talk - we saved a million jobs. Two hundred\n\nthousand people are working today.\n\nAnd I've never met two guys who're more down on America across\n\nthe board. We're told everything's going bad. There are 5.2 million\n\nnew jobs, private-sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million - if\n\nthey'd get out of the way, if they'd get out of the way and let us\n\npass the tax cut for the middle class, make it permanent, if they get\n\nout of the way and pass the - pass the jobs bill, if they get out of\n\nthe way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay\n\nin their homes because their mortgages are upside down, but they never\n\nmissed a mortgage payment, just get out of the way.\n\nStop talking about how you care about people. Show me something.\n\nShow me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility.\n\nAnd, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell\n\nout of the sky, like, \"Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?\" It\n\ncame from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the\n\nsame time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a\n\ntrillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there. I voted\n\nagainst them. I said, no, we can't afford that.\n\nAnd now, all of a sudden, these guys are so seized with the\n\nconcern about the debt that they created.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Let's not forget that they came in with one-party control.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything. They\n\nhad the ability to do everything of their choosing. And look at where\n\nwe are right now.\n\nThey passed the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831\n\nbillion, spend it on all of these special interest groups, and that it\n\nwould work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8\n\npercent - it went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that,\n\nright now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy would grow at\n\n4 percent. It's growing at 1.3.\n\nRADDATZ: When could you get it below 6 percent?\n\nRYAN: That's what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan for\n\na stronger middle class is all about: getting the economy growing at\n\n4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over the next four years.\n\nLook at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was\n\nin charge of overseeing this. $90 billion in green pork to campaign\n\ncontributors and special interest groups. There are just at the\n\nDepartment of Energy over 100 criminal investigations that have been\n\nlaunched into just how stimulus...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRADDATZ: Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague...\n\nRYAN: Crony capitalism and corporate welfare.\n\nBIDEN: ... runs an investigative committee, spent months and\n\nmonths and months going into this.\n\nRYAN: This is the - this is the inspector general.\n\nBIDEN: Months and months. They found no evidence of cronyism.\n\nAnd I love my friend here. I - I'm not allowed to show letters\n\nbut go on our website, he sent me two letters saying, \"By the way, can\n\nyou send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of\n\nWisconsin?\" We sent millions of dollars. You know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money, correct?\n\nBIDEN: Sure he did. By the way...\n\nRYAN: On two occasions we - we - we advocated for constituents\n\nwho were applying for grants. That's what we do. We do that for all\n\nconstituents who are...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: I love that. I love that. This was such a bad program\n\nand he writes me a letter saying - writes the Department of Energy a\n\nletter saying, \"The reason we need this stimulus, it will create\n\ngrowth and jobs.\" His words. And now he's sitting here looking at\n\nme.\n\nAnd by the way, that program, again, investigated. What the\n\nCongress said was it was a model. Less than four-tenths of 1 percent\n\nwaste or fraud in the program.\n\nAnd all this talk about cronyism. They investigated and\n\ninvestigated, did not find one single piece of evidence. I wish he\n\nwould just tell - be a little more candid.\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric\n\ncars in Finland, or on windmills in China?\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\nRYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries\n\nlike China and spend it on all these various different interest\n\ngroups?\n\nBIDEN: Let me tell you what was a good idea. It was a good\n\nidea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to\n\nstop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able\n\nto grow again. We have, in fact, 4 percent of those green jobs didn't\n\ngo under - went under, didn't work. It's a better batting average\n\nthan investment bankers have. They have about a 40 percent...\n\nRYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being...\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements. I\n\nthink we've gone over this quite enough.\n\nBIDEN: By the way, any letter you send me, I'll entertain.\n\nRYAN: I appreciate that, Joe.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements. Both\n\nMedicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share\n\nof the budget in the process.\n\nWill benefits for Americans under these programs have to change\n\nfor the programs to survive?\n\nMr. Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going\n\nbankrupt. These are indisputable facts.\n\nLook, when I look at these programs, we've all had tragedies in\n\nour lives. I think about what they've done for my own family. My mom\n\nand I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer's.\n\nMedicare was there for here, just like it's there for my mom right now\n\nwho is a Florida senior.\n\nAfter my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors\n\nbenefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college\n\nin her 50s where she started a small business because of the new\n\nskills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these\n\nprograms would be there for her.\n\nWe will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform\n\nit for my generation.\n\nYou see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people\n\n54 and below, you can guarantee they don't change for people in or\n\nnear retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are\n\nproposing.\n\nLook what - look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716\n\nbillion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief\n\nactuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can't spend the same\n\ndollar twice. You can't claim that this money goes to Medicare and\n\nObamacare.\n\nRYAN: And then they put this new Obamacare board in charge of\n\ncutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied\n\ncare for current seniors.\n\nThis board, by the way, it's 15 people, the president's supposed\n\nto appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have\n\nmedical training.\n\nAnd Social Security? If we don't shore up Social Security, when\n\nwe run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent\n\nacross-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle\n\nof their retirement. We're going to stop that from happening.\n\nThey haven't put a credible solution on the table. He'll tell\n\nyou about vouchers. He'll say all these things to try and scare\n\npeople. Here's what we're saying: give younger people, when they\n\nbecome Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can't\n\nbe denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then\n\nMedicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people,\n\nmore coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket\n\ncoverage for the poor and the sick.\n\nChoice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future\n\nseniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of\n\n15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah\n\nPalin. It seems every vice presidential debate I hear this kind of\n\nstuff about panels.\n\nBut let's talk about Medicare. What we did is, we saved $716\n\nbillion and put it back, applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of\n\nMedicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies, doctors and\n\nhospitals. The AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did.\n\nAnd it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this\n\nall out.\n\nIt also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself:\n\nDo you have more benefits today? You do. If you're near the donut\n\nhole, you have $800 - $600 more to help your prescription drug costs.\n\nYou get wellness visits without co-pays. They wipe all of this out,\n\nand Medicare goes - becomes insolvent in 2016, number one.\n\nNumber two, \"guaranteed benefit\"? It's a voucher. When they\n\nfirst proposed - when the congressman had his first voucher program,\n\nthe CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every\n\nsenior, 55 and below, when they got there. He knew that, yet he got\n\nall the guys in Congress and women in the Republican Party to vote for\n\nit. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it, were I\n\nthere.\n\nWho you believe, the AMA, me, a guy who's fought his whole life\n\nfor this, or somebody who would actually put in motion a plan that\n\nknowingly cut - added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?\n\nNow they got a new plan: \"Trust me, it's not going to cost you\n\nany more.\" Folks, follow your instincts on this one.\n\nAnd with regard to Social Security, we will not - we will not\n\nprivatize it. If we had listened to Romney, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors\n\nwould be now if their money had been in the market.\n\nTheir ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate\n\nthe guarantee of Medicare.\n\nRYAN: Here's the problem. They got caught with their hands in\n\nthe cookie jar, turning Medicare into a piggybank for Obamacare.\n\nTheir own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said\n\none out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of\n\nbusiness as a result of this.\n\nBIDEN: That's not what they said.\n\nRYAN: 7.4 million seniors are projected to lose their current\n\nMedicare Advantage coverage they have. That's a $3,200 benefit cut.\n\nBIDEN: That didn't happen.\n\nRYAN: What we're saying...\n\nBIDEN: More people signed up.\n\nRYAN: These are from your own actuaries.\n\nBIDEN: More - more - more people signed up for Medicare\n\nAdvantage after the change.\n\nRYAN: What - there's...\n\nBIDEN: Nobody is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know...\n\nBIDEN: No, this is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress to\n\nmake up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if\n\nwe don't keep interrupting each other.\n\nBIDEN: Well, don't take all the four minutes then.\n\nRYAN: Let me just - let me just say this. We are not - we're\n\nsaying don't change benefits for people 55 and above. They already\n\norganized their retirement around these promises.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... programs for those of us.\n\nRADDATZ: But let - let me ask you this. What - what is your\n\nspecific plan for seniors who really can't afford to make up the\n\ndifference in the value of what you call a premium support plan and\n\nothers call a voucher?\n\nRYAN: Hundred percent coverage...\n\nRADDATZ: And what...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's what we're saying. So we're saying...\n\nRADDATZ: How do you make that up?\n\nRYAN: ... income adjusts (inaudible) these premium support\n\npayments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.\n\nLook, this is a plan - by the way, that $6,400 number, it was\n\nmisleading then, it's totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that's\n\nbipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat\n\nsenator from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: There's not one Democrat who endorses it.\n\nRYAN: It's a plan...\n\nBIDEN: Not one Democrat who (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.\n\nBIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (inaudible).\n\nRYAN: We - we - we put it - we put it together with the\n\nformer Clinton budget director.\n\nBIDEN: Who disavows it.\n\nRYAN: This idea - this idea came from the Clinton commission to\n\nsave Medicare chaired by Senator John Breaux.\n\nHere's the point, Martha.\n\nBIDEN: Which was rejected.\n\nRYAN: If we don't - if we don't fix this problem pretty soon\n\nthen current seniors get cut. Here's the problem: 10,000 people are\n\nretiring every single day in America today and they will for 20 years.\n\nThat's not a political thing, that's a math thing.\n\nBIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just - if they\n\njust allowed Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid\n\ncan, that would save $156 billion right off the bat.\n\nRYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.\n\nBIDEN: All - all - all...\n\nRYAN: It has a restricted...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Seniors are not denied.\n\nRYAN: Absolutely.\n\nBIDEN: They are not denied.\n\nLook, folks, all you seniors out there, have you been denied\n\nchoices? Have you lost Medicare Advantage.\n\nRYAN: Because it's working well right now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Because we've changed the law.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help\n\nsolve the problem, why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility\n\nage by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?\n\nBIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security\n\nin 1983. I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included\n\nTip O'Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together\n\nand everybody said, as long as everybody's in the deal, everybody's in\n\nthe deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.\n\nWe made the system solvent to 2033. We will not, though, be part\n\nof any voucher plan eliminating - the voucher says, \"Mom, when you're\n\n- when you're 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can\n\nget. You're out of Medicare.\"\n\nYou can buy back in if you want with this voucher, which will not\n\nkeep pace - will not keep pace with health care costs. Because if it\n\ndid keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings.\n\nThat's why they go the voucher. They - we will be no part of a\n\nvoucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\n\nRYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check, and buy\n\nsomething. Nobody's proposing that. Barack Obama four years ago\n\nrunning for president said if you don't have any fresh ideas, use\n\nstale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a good record to run\n\non, paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Make a big election about small ideas.\n\nRADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with\n\nPresident Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social\n\nSecurity.\n\nRYAN: For younger people. What we said then, and what I've\n\nalways agreed is let younger Americans have a voluntary choice of\n\nmaking their money work faster for them within the Social Security\n\nsystem.\n\nBIDEN: You saw how well that worked.\n\nRYAN: That's not what Mitt Romney's proposing. What we're\n\nsaying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.\n\nBIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing...\n\nRYAN: And then the kinds of changes we're talking about for\n\nyounger people like myself is don't increase the benefits for wealthy\n\npeople as fast as everybody else. Slowly raise the retirement age\n\nover time.\n\nBIDEN: Martha...\n\nRYAN: It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103\n\naccording to the actuaries.\n\nNow, here's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President?\n\nBIDEN: Quickly. The bottom line here is that all the studies\n\nshow that if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt\n\nRomney, if you're 40 - in your 40s now you will pay $2,600 a year -\n\nyou get $2,600 a year less in Social Security. If you're in your 20s\n\nnow, you get $4,700 (inaudible) less.\n\nThe idea of changing, and change being in this case to cut the\n\nbenefits for people without taking other action you could do to make\n\nit work is absolutely the wrong way.\n\nThese - look, these guys haven't been big on Medicare from the\n\nbeginning. Their party's not been big on Medicare from the beginning.\n\nAnd they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do.\n\nLook, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this -\n\na man who introduced a bill that would raise it 40 - $6,400 a year;\n\nknowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he'd sign it, or me and\n\nthe president?\n\nRYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more\n\nimportantly...\n\nBIDEN: That's - there are the facts right...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: This is what politicians do when they don't have a record\n\nto run on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don't get\n\nahead of this problem, it's going to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries - there are more beneficiaries...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to move...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: ... very simple question...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're not going to run away. Medicare and Social Security\n\ndid so much for my own family. We are not going to jeopardize this\n\nprogram, but we have to save it...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: You are jeopardizing this program. You're changing the\n\nprogram from a guaranteed benefit to premium support. Whatever you\n\ncall it, the bottom line is people are going to have to pay more money\n\nout of their pocket and the families I know and the families I come\n\nfrom, they don't have the money to pay more out...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: That's why we're saying more for lower income people and\n\nless for higher income people.\n\nRADDATZ: Gentlemen, I would like to move on to a very simple\n\nquestion for both of you, and something tells me I won't get a very\n\nsimple answer, but let me ask you this.\n\nBIDEN: I gave you a simple answer. He's raising the cost of\n\nMedicare.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will\n\npay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we're starting with Vice\n\nPresident Biden for two minutes.\n\nBIDEN: The middle class will pay less and people making $1\n\nmillion or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give\n\nyou one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts - we\n\nare arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed\n\nto expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million -\n\nbillion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million.\n\nWe see no justification in these economic times for those, and\n\nthey're patriotic Americans. They're not asking for this continued\n\ntax cut. They're not suggesting it, but my friends are insisting on\n\nit; 120,000 families by continuing that tax cut will get an additional\n\n$500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years and their income is an\n\naverage of $8 million.\n\nWe want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -\n\npermanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won't\n\nallow us to. You know what they're saying? We say \"let's have a vote\n\n- let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and let's have a vote\n\non the upper (ph) tax cut; let's go ahead and vote on it.\"\n\nThey're saying no. They're holding hostage the middle class tax\n\ncut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, they've got another tax\n\ncut coming that's $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will\n\nin fact give another $250 million - yeah, $250,000 a year to those\n\n120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle income with\n\na child by $2,000 a year.\n\nThis is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle\n\nclass got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them.\n\nThey need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000\n\nfamilies for another - another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10\n\nyears.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman?\n\nRYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow\n\nthe economy and create jobs. It's a plan that's estimated to create 7\n\nmillion jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a\n\nfamily and business's income is enough. President Obama thinks that\n\nthe government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a\n\nsmall business's income.\n\nRYAN: Look, if you taxed every person and successful business\n\nmaking over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government\n\nfor 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including\n\nsuccessful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year,\n\nwe'd still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren't enough\n\nrich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending.\n\nAnd so the next time you hear them say, \"Don't worry about it,\n\nwe'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,\" watch out,\n\nmiddle class, the tax bill's coming to you.\n\nThat's why we're saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let's\n\ntake a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file\n\ntheir taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come\n\nfrom, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped\n\ntheir tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in\n\nthe industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the\n\ntop effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40\n\npercent.\n\nTwo-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax\n\nwould actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It's\n\nexpected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn't even\n\npay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases.\n\nWhat we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close\n\nloopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three\n\nbottom lines: Don't raise the deficit, don't raise taxes on the\n\nmiddle class, and don't lower the share of income that is borne by the\n\nhigh-income earners.\n\nHe'll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose. It's been\n\ndiscredited by six other studies. And even their own deputy campaign\n\nmanager acknowledged that it wasn't correct.\n\nRADDATZ: Well, let's talk about this 20 percent. You have\n\nrefused - and, again - to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20\n\npercent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics?\n\nOr are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters?\n\nRYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to\n\nhave big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the...\n\nRADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That would - that would be a first for the Republican\n\nCongress.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you know exactly what you're doing?\n\nRYAN: Look - look at what Mitt Romney - look at what Ronald\n\nReagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework\n\nto lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to\n\nfix that.\n\nWhat we're saying is, here's our framework. Lower tax rates 20\n\npercent. We raised about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We\n\nforego about $1.1 trillion in loopholes and deductions. And so what\n\nwe're saying is, deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income\n\ntaxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader\n\nbase of taxation...\n\nBIDEN: Can I translate?\n\nRYAN: ... so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now,\n\nhere's why I'm saying this. What we're saying is, here's the\n\nframework...\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this.\n\nRADDATZ: You'll get time.\n\nRYAN: We want to work with Congress - we want to work with the\n\nCongress on how best to achieve this. That means successful. Look...\n\nRADDATZ: No specifics, again.\n\nRYAN: Mitt - what we're saying is, lower tax rates 20 percent,\n\nstart with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it...\n\nRADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up?\n\nRYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed - six studies\n\nhave verified that this math adds up. But here's...\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: .. let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.\n\nRYAN: I'll come back in a second, then, right?\n\nBIDEN: First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks\n\n- he gave specifics of what he was going to cut, number one, in terms\n\nof tax expenditures. Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses\n\nin America pay less - make less than $250,000.\n\nLet me tell you who some of those other small businesses are:\n\nhedge funds that make $600 million, $800 million a year. That's -\n\nthat's what they count as small businesses, because they're pass-\n\nthrough.\n\nLet's look at how sincere they are. Ronald - I mean, excuse me,\n\nGovernor Romney on \"60 Minutes\" - I guess it was about 10 days ago -\n\nmaking $50,000 pays more than that. Do you think that's fair?\" He\n\nsaid, \"Oh, yes, that's fair. That's fair.\"\n\nThis is - and they're going to talk - you think these guys are\n\ngoing to go out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole - the\n\nbiggest loophole they take advantage of is the carried interest\n\nloophole and - and capital gains loophole. They exempt that.\n\nBIDEN: Now, there's not enough - the reason why the AEI study,\n\nthe American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center study,\n\nthe reason they all say it's going - taxes go up on the middle class,\n\nthe only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage\n\ndeduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction,\n\nmiddle-class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to\n\nsend their kids to college. That's why they arrive at it.\n\nRADDATZ: Is he wrong about that?\n\nRYAN: He is wrong about that. They're...\n\nBIDEN: How's that?\n\nRYAN: You can - you can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still\n\npreserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers...\n\nBIDEN: Not mathematically possible.\n\nRYAN: It is mathematically possible. It's been done before.\n\nIt's precisely what we're proposing.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: It's been done a couple of times, actually.\n\nBIDEN: It has never been done before.\n\nRYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald\n\nReagan...\n\nBIDEN: Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRYAN: Ronald Reagan - Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: This is amazing.\n\nRYAN: Republican and Democrats have worked together on this.\n\nBIDEN: That's right.\n\nRYAN: You know, I understand you guys aren't used to doing\n\nbipartisan deals...\n\nBIDEN: But we told each other what we're going to do.\n\nRYAN: Republicans and Democrats...\n\nBIDEN: When we did it Reagan, we said, here - here are the\n\nthings we're going to cut.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's what we said.\n\nRYAN: We said here's the framework, let's work together to fill\n\nin the details. That's exactly...\n\nBIDEN: Fill in the detail.\n\nRYAN: That's how you get things done. You work with Congress -\n\nlook, let me say it this way.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's coming from a Republican Congress working\n\nbipartisanly, 7 percent rating? Come on.\n\nRYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87\n\npercent of the legislators he served, which were Democrats. He didn't\n\ndemonize them. He didn't demagogue them. He met with those party\n\nleaders every week. He reached across the aisle. He didn't\n\ncompromise principles.\n\nBIDEN: And you saw what happened.\n\nRYAN: He found common ground - and he balanced the budget...\n\nBIDEN: You saw - if he did such a great job...\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... four times without raising taxes...\n\nBIDEN: Why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Vice President, what would you suggest - what\n\nwould you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy, that would\n\nsubstantially reduce the long-term deficit?\n\nBIDEN: Just let the taxes expire like they're supposed to on\n\nthose millionaires. We don't - we can't afford $800 billion going to\n\npeople making a minimum of $1 million. They do not need it, Martha.\n\nThose 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people\n\nneed the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for\n\nthem? Why does he go after the childcare...\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nBIDEN: Why do they do that?\n\nRADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits?\n\nRYAN: Yeah, we're saying close loopholes...\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: ... on high-interest people.\n\nRADDATZ: Home mortgage deduction?\n\nRYAN: For higher-income people. Here...\n\nBIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000\n\nwill have a mortgage - their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?\n\nRYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to\n\nmake you think that it's just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an\n\nactor...\n\nBIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less\n\nthan $250,000 a year, would not be affected.\n\nRYAN: Joe, you know it hits a million - this taxes a million\n\npeople, a million small businesses.\n\nBIDEN: Does it tax 97 percent of the American businesses?\n\nRYAN: It taxes a million small businesses...\n\nBIDEN: Small businesses?\n\nRYAN: ... who are our greatest job creators.\n\nBIDEN: I wish I'd get - the \"greatest job creators\" are the\n\nhedge fund guys.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're - and you're going to increase the defense\n\nbudget.\n\nRYAN: Think about it this way.\n\nRADDATZ: And you're going to increase the defense budget.\n\nRYAN: No, we're not just going to cut the defense budget like\n\nthey're - they're proposing...\n\nBIDEN: They're going to increase it $2 billion.\n\nRYAN: That's not...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We're talking about...\n\nRADDATZ: So no massive defense increases?\n\nRYAN: No, we're saying don't - OK, you want to get into defense\n\nnow?\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, I do. I do, because that's another math question.\n\nRYAN: So - right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you do that?\n\nRYAN: So they proposed a $478 billion cut to defense to begin\n\nwith. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that's lurking\n\non the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the\n\ndebt negotiations, and so we have a $1 trillion cut...\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put the automatic defense cuts aside, OK?\n\nRYAN: Right, OK.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's put those aside. No one wants that.\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to go back to that.\n\nRADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this\n\nincrease in defense spending?\n\nBIDEN: Two trillion dollars.\n\nRYAN: You don't cut defense by a trillion dollars. That's what\n\nwe're talking about.\n\nRADDATZ: And what - what national security issues justify an\n\nincrease?\n\nBIDEN: Who's cutting it by $1 trillion?\n\nRYAN: We're going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120\n\ncargo planes. We're going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out...\n\nRADDATZ: Drawing down in one war and one war...\n\nRYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the smallest -\n\nthe smallest it has been since before World War I.\n\nThis invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through\n\nstrength? You bet we do. And that means you don't impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military.\n\nSo we're saying don't cut the military by a trillion dollars.\n\nNot increase it by a trillion, don't cut it by a trillion dollars.\n\nRADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden on this. I want to move\n\non.\n\nBIDEN: Look, we don't cut it. And I might add, this so-called\n\n- I know we don't want to use the fancy word \"sequester,\" this\n\nAnd let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference\n\nannouncing his support of the deal. He said, and I'm paraphrase,\n\nWe've been looking for this moment for a long time.\n\nRYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.\n\nBIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the\n\nautomatic cuts in defense if they didn't act.\n\nsays we need a smaller, leaner Army, we need more special forces, we\n\nneed - we don't need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs.\n\nRADDATZ: Some of the military.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Not some of the military. That was the decision of the\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the\n\npresident. That is a fact.\n\nRADDATZ: Who answers to a civilian leader.\n\nBIDEN: They made the recommendation first.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Let's move on to Afghanistan.\n\nRYAN: Can I get into that for a second?\n\nRADDATZ: I'd like to move on to Afghanistan please. And that's\n\none of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars, and\n\nmore importantly in lives.\n\nWe just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops\n\nthere in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the\n\nvery Afghan forces we are trying to help.\n\nNow, we've reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces, we've\n\ndegraded Al Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we\n\nreally accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten. We want to\n\nmake sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give Al Qaida a\n\nsafe haven.\n\nWe agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.\n\nLook, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the\n\nincredible job that our troops have done. You've been there more than\n\nthe two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was\n\namazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph)\n\nValley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private\n\nin the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell\n\nme what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had\n\nin front of them.\n\nAnd then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand\n\nwith the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, it's nothing\n\nshort of amazing.\n\nWhat we don't want to do is lose the gains we've gotten. Now,\n\nwe've disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have\n\nmore likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our\n\ncommanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels\n\nthroughout this year's fighting season. We've been skeptical about\n\nnegotiations with the Taliban, especially while they're shooting at\n\nus.\n\nBut we want to see the 2014 transition be successful, and that\n\nmeans we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make\n\nsure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a\n\nlaunching pad for terrorists.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Martha, let's keep our eye on the ball. The reason -\n\nI've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times. I've been up\n\nin the Konar (ph) Valley. I've been throughout that whole country,\n\nmostly in a helicopter, and sometimes in a vehicle.\n\nThe fact is, we went there for one reason: to get those people\n\nwho killed Americans, Al Qaida. We've decimated Al Qaida central. We\n\nhave eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.\n\nAnd, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would\n\nhelp train the Afghan military. It's their responsibility to take\n\nover their own security. That's why with 49 of our allies in\n\nAfghanistan, we've agreed on a gradual drawdown so we're out of there\n\nby the year 20 - in the year 2014.\n\nMy friend and the governor say it's based on conditions, which\n\nmeans it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the\n\nresponsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We\n\nhave trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been\n\nmore than two dozen cases of green-on-blue where Americans have been\n\nkilled. If we do not - if the measures the military has taken do not\n\ntake hold, we will not go on joint patrols. We will not train in the\n\nfield. We'll only train in the - in the Army bases that exist there.\n\nBut we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period. And in the\n\nprocess, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800\n\nbillion. We've been in this war for over a decade. The primary\n\nobjective is almost completed. Now, all we're doing is putting the\n\nKabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own\n\nsecurity.\n\nIt's their responsibility, not America's.\n\nRADDATZ: What - what conditions could justify staying,\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: We don't want to stay. We want - look, one of my best\n\nfriends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward-operating base in\n\neastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends. Our\n\ndaughters are best friends. I want - I want him and all of our\n\ntroops to come home as soon and safely as possible.\n\nWe want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That's why we want\n\nto make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to\n\nmake it successful. We don't want to extend beyond 2014. That's the\n\npoint we're making.\n\nYou know, if it was just this, I'd feel like we would - we would\n\nbe able to call this a success, but it's not. What we are witnessing\n\nas we turn on our television screens these days is the absolute\n\nunraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home,\n\nbut - problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren't growing here at\n\nhome.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we're absolutely\n\nleaving in 2014. You're saying that's not an absolute, but you won't\n\ntalk about what conditions would justify...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Do you know why we say that?\n\nBIDEN: I'd like to know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies \"put a\n\ndate on your calendar, wait us out, and then come back.\" We want to\n\nmake sure...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline.\n\nRYAN: We do agree - we do agree with the timeline and the\n\ntransition, but what we - what any administration will do in 2013 is\n\nassess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline. What\n\nwe do not want to do...\n\nBIDEN: We will leave in 2014.\n\nRYAN: ... what we don't want to do is give our allies reason to\n\ntrust us less and our enemies more - we don't want to embolden our\n\nenemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Martha, that's a bizarre statement.\n\nRYAN: That's why we want to make sure - no, that's why we want\n\nto make sure that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine of our allies - hear me - 49 of our allies\n\nsigned on to this position.\n\nRYAN: And we're reading that they want to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Forty-nine - 49 of our allies said \"out in 2014.\" It's\n\nthe responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Do you really think that this timeline...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Which is - which is...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: We have - we have soldiers and Marines. We have\n\nAfghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do you\n\nthink, taking advantage of this timeline?\n\nBIDEN: Look, the Taliban - what we've found out, and we - you\n\nsaw it in Iraq, Martha, unless you set a timeline, Baghdad, in the\n\ncase of Iraq, and - and Kabul, in the case of Afghanistan will not\n\nstep up. They're happy to let us continue to do the job;\n\ninternational security forces to do the job.\n\nThe only way they step up is to say, \"Fellas, we're leaving;\n\nwe've trained you; step up, step up.\"\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back.\n\nBIDEN: That's the only way it works.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me go back to the - the surge troops that we put\n\nin there. And - and you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have\n\ntalked to a lot of troops. I've talked to senior offices who were\n\nconcerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting\n\nseason, and some of them saw that as a political - as a political\n\nmove. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military\n\nreason for bringing those surge troops home...\n\nBIDEN: The military reason...\n\nRADDATZ: ... before the fighting had ended?\n\nBIDEN: ... was bringing - by the way, when the president\n\nannounced the surge, you'll remember, Martha, he said the surge will\n\nbe out by the end of the summer. The military said the surge will be\n\nout. Nothing political about this.\n\nBefore the surge occurred - so you be a little straight with me\n\nhere, too - before the surge occurred, we said they'll be out by the\n\nend of the summer. That's what the military said. The reason for\n\nthat is...\n\nRADDATZ: The military follows orders. I mean, there - trust\n\nme. There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the\n\nfighting season.\n\nBIDEN: Sure. There are people that are concerned, but not the\n\nJoint Chiefs. That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the\n\npresident of the United States of America. I sat there. I'm sure\n\nyou'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I'm positive\n\nyou'll find that within the military. But that's not the case here.\n\nAnd, secondly, the reason why the military said that is, you\n\ncannot wait and have a cliff. It takes - you know - months and\n\nmonths and months to draw down forces.\n\nRYAN: Let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: Let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think\n\nthis - it can get a little confusing. We've all met with General\n\nAllen and General Scaparrotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting\n\nseasons.\n\nHere's the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow.\n\nThe Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura\n\ncome over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in\n\nwith snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons.\n\nIn the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes\n\ndown.\n\nAnd so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress\n\nand said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is\n\nend, it puts people more at risk. That's the problem.\n\nYes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month, but the remaining\n\ntroops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute\n\ncounterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people. That makes them\n\nless safe.\n\nBIDEN: Fighting season...\n\nRYAN: We're sending fewer people out in all of these hotspots to\n\ndo the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago.\n\nBIDEN: Because we turned it over...\n\nRYAN: But we took 22,000 people out...\n\nBIDEN: ... we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.\n\nNo one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan\n\npersonnel. And he's - he's conflating two issues. The fighting\n\nseason that Petraeus was talking about and former - and Admiral\n\nMullen was the fighting season this spring. That's what he was\n\ntalking about. We did not - we did not pull them out.\n\nRYAN: The calendar works the same every year.\n\nBIDEN: It does work the same every year. But we're not staying\n\nthere...\n\nRYAN: Spring, summer, fall. It's warm, or it's not. They're\n\nstill fighting us. They're still coming over the passes. They're\n\nstill coming into Zabul, to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are\n\nsending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.\n\nWe've trained them.\n\nRYAN: Not in the east.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move - let's move to another war.\n\nBIDEN: Not in the east?\n\nRYAN: R.C. East - R.C. East...\n\nBIDEN: R.C. East is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nRYAN: That's right. That's why we don't want to send fewer\n\npeople to the...\n\nBIDEN: That's - that's why we should send Americans in to do\n\nthe job, instead of the - you'd rather Americans be going in doing\n\nthe job instead of the trainees?\n\nRYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job, but\n\nfewer of them. That's the whole problem.\n\nBIDEN: That's right. We're sending in more Afghans to do the\n\njob, Afghans to do the job.\n\nRADDATZ: Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria,\n\nwhere there are estimates that more - estimates that more than\n\n25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year,\n\nPresident Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying\n\nit was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres\n\nfrom occurring there. So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: Different country. It's a different country. It is five\n\ntimes as large geographically, it has one-fifth the population, that\n\nis Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large\n\ngeographically.\n\nIt's in a part of the world where they're not going to see\n\nwhatever would come from that war. It seep into a regional war.\n\nYou're in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the\n\nmost dangerous area in the world. And, in fact, if in fact it blows\n\nup and the wrong people gain control, it's going to have impact on the\n\nentire region causing potentially regional wars.\n\nWe are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the\n\nJordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region\n\nattempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when\n\nAssad goes - and he will go - there will be a legitimate government\n\nthat follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.\n\nAnd all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the\n\ncongressman, about how we're going to do, we could do so much more in\n\nthere, what more would they do other than put American boots on the\n\nground?\n\nThe last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in\n\nthe Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000\n\nAmerican forces. That - they are the facts. They are the facts.\n\nanything. He - he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he\n\ngets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we\n\nare doing now.\n\nAre they proposing putting American troops on the ground?\n\nPutting American aircraft in the airspace? Is that what they're\n\nproposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so, but that's\n\nnot what they're saying.\n\nWe are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those\n\nforces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not\n\ncause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (sic) - when Bashar Assad\n\nfalls.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria. American\n\ntroops.\n\nNow, let me say it this way. How would we do things differently?\n\nWe wouldn't refer to Bashar Assad as a reformer when he's killing his\n\nown civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldn't be\n\noutsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations giving Vladimir\n\nPutin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue.\n\nHe's vetoed three of them.\n\nHillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do\n\nso. They thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side\n\nof history. She was right about that. This is just one more example\n\nof how the Russia reset's not working.\n\nAnd so where are we? After international pressure mounted, the\n\nPresident Obama said Bashar Assad should go. It's been over a year.\n\nThe man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. And more\n\nforeign fighters are spilling into this country.\n\nSo the longer this has gone on, the more people, groups like Al\n\nQaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the free\n\nSyrian army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks,\n\nthe Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin\n\nwith working through our allies. But, no, we waited for Kofi Annan to\n\ntry and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar\n\nAssad time.\n\nWe gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. And\n\nmeanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.\n\nBIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he\n\nnever answers the question.\n\nRYAN: No, I would - I - we would not be going through the U.N.\n\nin all of these things.\n\nBIDEN: Let me - you don't go through the U.N. We are in the\n\nprocess now - and have been for months - in making sure that help,\n\nhumanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training is getting to\n\nthose forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians\n\nbelieve, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria. That\n\nis underway.\n\nOur allies were all on the same page, NATO, as well as our Arab\n\nallies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea.\n\nWe're the ones that said, \"Enough.\"\n\nWith regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is\n\nthat Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that's\n\nnot in our interest.\n\nRADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall, Congressman Ryan?\n\nWhat happens to the region? What happens if he hangs on? What\n\nhappens if he does?\n\nRYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He's a\n\nsponsor of terrorism. He'll probably continue slaughtering his\n\npeople. We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.\n\nLook, he mentioned the reset...\n\nRADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?\n\nRYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do\n\non chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to\n\nsecure those chemical weapons. They're right about that.\n\nBut what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom\n\nfighters, those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar\n\nAssad a reformer. And...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... we should not have - we should not have waited to\n\nRussia...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... should not have waited for Russia to give us the green\n\nlight at the U.N. to do something about it.\n\nBIDEN: Russia...\n\nRYAN: They're - they're still arming the man. Iran is flying\n\nflights over Iraq...\n\nBIDEN: And the opposition is being armed.\n\nRYAN: ... to help Bashar Assad. And, by the way, if we had the\n\nstatus-of-forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet\n\nhis vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to\n\nprevent that. But he failed to achieve that, as well, again.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me ask you a quick question.\n\nBIDEN: I don't...\n\nRADDATZ: What's your criteria for intervention?\n\nBIDEN: Yeah.\n\nRYAN: In Syria?\n\nRADDATZ: Worldwide.\n\nRYAN: What is in the national interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests?\n\nRYAN: What is in the national security of the American people.\n\nIt's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.\n\nRADDATZ: No humanitarian?\n\nRYAN: Each situation will - will come up with its own set of\n\ncircumstances, but putting American troops on the ground? That's got\n\nto be within the national security interests of the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to - we're - we're almost out of time here.\n\nRYAN: That means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights,\n\nthose are things that don't put American troops on the ground. But if\n\nyou're talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in\n\nour national security interests.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these\n\nlast few questions. This debate is, indeed, historic. We have two\n\nCatholic candidates, first time, on a stage such as this. And I would\n\nlike to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in\n\nyour own personal views on abortion.\n\nPlease talk about how you came to that decision. Talk about how\n\nyour religion played a part in that. And, please, this is such an\n\nemotional issue for so many people in this country...\n\nRYAN: Sure.\n\nRADDATZ: ... please talk personally about this, if you could.\n\nCongressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I don't see how a person can separate their public life\n\nfrom their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in\n\neverything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the\n\nvulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\n\nRYAN: Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life? It's not\n\nsimply because of my Catholic faith. That's a factor, of course. But\n\nit's also because of reason and science.\n\nYou know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I\n\nwent to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven\n\nweek ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A\n\nlittle baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have\n\nnicknamed our firstborn child Liza, \"Bean.\" Now I believe that life\n\nbegins at conception.\n\nThat's why - those are the reasons why I'm pro-life. Now I\n\nunderstand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don't\n\nagree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will\n\nbe to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life\n\nof the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has\n\nhandled all of these issues. Look at what they're doing through\n\nObamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this\n\ncountry. They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of\n\nreligion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches,\n\nCatholic hospitals.\n\nOur church should not have to sue our federal government to\n\nmaintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the\n\nDemocratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and\n\nrare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer\n\nfunding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign\n\naid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he\n\nsympathized and wouldn't second guess their one child policy of forced\n\nabortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: My religion defines who I am, and I've been a practicing\n\nCatholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social\n\ndoctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of\n\nthose who - who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.\n\nWith regard to - with regard to abortion, I accept my church's\n\nposition on abortion as a - what we call a (inaudible) doctrine.\n\nLife begins at conception in the church's judgment. I accept it in my\n\npersonal life.\n\nBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and\n\nMuslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike\n\nmy friend here, the - the congressman. I - I do not believe that we\n\nhave a right to tell other people that - women they can't control\n\ntheir body. It's a decision between them and their doctor. In my\n\nview and the Supreme Court, I'm not going to interfere with that.\n\nWith regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it\n\nabsolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,\n\nincluding Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy\n\nHospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none\n\nhas to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get\n\ncontraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\n\nThat is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the - we\n\ndiffer, my friend says that he - well I guess he accepts Governor\n\nRomney's position now, because in the past he has argued that there\n\nwas - there's rape and forcible rape. He's argued that in the case\n\nof rape or incest, it was still - it would be a crime to engage in\n\nhaving an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.\n\nRYAN: All I'm saying is, if you believe that life begins at\n\nconception, that, therefore, doesn't change the definition of life.\n\nThat's a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to\n\noppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the\n\nmother.\n\nNow, I've got to take issue with the Catholic church and\n\nreligious liberty.\n\nBIDEN: You have on the issue...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... why would they keep - why would they keep suing you?\n\nIt's a distinction without a difference.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If\n\nthe Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that\n\nabortion should remain legal be worried?\n\nRYAN: We don't think that unelected judges should make this\n\ndecision; that people through their elected representatives in\n\nreaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should\n\nmake this determination.\n\nBIDEN: The court - the next president will get one or two\n\nSupreme Court nominees. That's how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask\n\nyourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -\n\nfor Mr. Romney, who do you think he's likely to appoint? Do you think\n\nhe's likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the\n\ncourt far right that would outlaw (inaudible) - outlaw abortion? I\n\nsuspect that would happen.\n\nI guarantee you, that will not happen. We picked two people. We\n\npick people who are open-minded. They've been good justices. So keep\n\nan eye on the Supreme Court...\n\nRYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?\n\nBIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an\n\nopen mind; did not come with an agenda.\n\nRADDATZ: I'm - I'm going to move on to this closing question\n\nbecause we are running out of time.\n\nCertainly (inaudible) and you've said it here tonight, that the\n\ntwo of you respect our troops enormously. Your son has served and\n\nperhaps someday your children will serve as well.\n\nI recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this\n\npresidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, \"the\n\nads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other rather\n\nthan building up the country.\"\n\nWhat would you say to that American hero about this campaign?\n\nAnd at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?\n\nVice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son who did\n\nserve a year in Iraq, that we only have one truly sacred obligation as\n\na government. That's to equip those we send into harm's way and care\n\nfor those who come home. That's the only sacred obligation we have.\n\nEverything else falls behind that.\n\nI would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated\n\nsoldier you talked about, fought for his country, that that should be\n\nhonored. He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who\n\ndon't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having\n\nto pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility.\n\nI would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in\n\nthis campaign and occur in every campaign that I'm sure both of us\n\nregret anyone having said, particularly in these - these special new\n\ngroups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have\n\nto identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the\n\nother candidate. It's - it's an abomination.\n\nBut the bottom line here is I'd ask that hero you referenced to\n\ntake a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has\n\nthe conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where\n\nthey were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out. Or\n\nwhether or not he's going to continue to focus on taking care of only\n\nthe very wealthy, not asking them to make - pay any part of the deal\n\nto bring - bring back the middle class and the economy of this\n\ncountry.\n\nI'd ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United\n\nStates has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the\n\nslipshod comments being made by my - my - or by Governor Romney\n\nserve - serve our interests very well.\n\nBut there are things that have been said in campaigns that I - I\n\nfind not very appealing.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.\n\nSecond of all, I'd say we are not going to impose these\n\ndevastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and\n\ntheir safety.\n\nAnd then I would say, you have a president who ran for president\n\nfour years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned his\n\ncampaign into attack, blame and defame.\n\nYou see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you\n\npaint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President\n\nObama said in 2008. It's what he's doing right now.\n\nLook at all the string of broken promises. If you like your\n\nhealth care plan, you can keep it. Try telling that to the 20 million\n\npeople who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare\n\ngoes through or the 7-point million - 7.4 million seniors who are\n\ngoing to lose it.\n\nOr remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than\n\n$250,000, your taxes won't go up. Of the 21 tax increases in\n\nObamacare, 12 of them hit the middle class.\n\nOr remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down\n\n$2,500 per family, per year? They've gone up $3,000, and they're\n\nexpected to go up another $2,400.\n\nOr remember when he said, \"I promise by the end of my first term\n\nI'll cut the deficit in half in four years\"? We've had four budgets,\n\nfour trillion-dollar deficits.\n\nA debt crisis is coming. We can't keep spending and borrowing\n\nlike this. We can't keep spending money we don't have.\n\nLeaders run to problem to fix problems. President Obama has not\n\neven put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal\n\nwith this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt\n\nRomney's put ideas on the table.\n\nWe've got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us. The\n\nbudget office, \"Can we see the plan?\" They sent us to the press\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"Tell us what President Obama's plan is\n\nto prevent a debt crisis.\" They said, \"It's a speech, we can't\n\nestimate speeches.\"\n\nYou see, that's what we get in this administration - speeches -\n\nbut we're not getting leadership.\n\nMitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His\n\nlifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship.\n\nAnd what do we have from the president? He broke his big promise\n\nto bring people together to solve the country's biggest problems.\n\nAnd what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.\n\nBIDEN: Martha?\n\nRYAN: We can do better than this.\n\nBIDEN: I hope I'll get equal time.\n\nRADDATZ: You will get just a few minutes here. A few seconds,\n\nreally.\n\nBIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have\n\neviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It is\n\n(inaudible) he will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will\n\nkick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the\n\ntax credit people have to be able to send their children to college.\n\nIt cuts education by $450 billion.\n\nIt does - it does virtually nothing except continue to increase\n\nthe tax cuts for the very wealthy. And, you know, we've had enough of\n\nthis.\n\nThe idea that he's so concerned about these deficits, I've\n\npointed out he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did...\n\nRADDATZ: We're going to - we're going to the closing statements\n\nin a minute.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: You're going to have your closing statement.\n\nRYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way,\n\nour budget...\n\nBIDEN: We have not raised...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: ... by 3 percent a year instead of 4.5 percent like they\n\npropose. Not spending more money as much as they say is not a\n\nspending cut.\n\nRADDATZ: Let me - let me calm down things here just for a\n\nminute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to\n\nclosing statements about your own personal character. If you are\n\nelected, what could you both give to this country as a man, as a human\n\nbeing, that no one else could?\n\nRYAN: Honesty, no one else could? There are plenty of fine\n\npeople who could lead this country. But what you need are people who,\n\nwhen they say they're going to do something, they go do it. What you\n\nneed are, when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those\n\nproblems. We're not getting that.\n\nLook, we can grow this economy faster. That's what our five-\n\npoint plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It's about\n\ngetting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay, getting people out of\n\npoverty into the middle class. That means going with proven, pro-\n\ngrowth policies that we know works to get people back to work.\n\nPutting ideas on the table, working with Democrats - that actually\n\nworks sometimes - and then...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Vice President, can we get to that - to that issue of\n\nwhat you could bring as a man, a human being? And I really - I'm\n\ngoing to keep you to about 15 seconds here.\n\nBIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, that's OK.\n\nRADDATZ: He didn't have 40. He didn't have 40.\n\nBIDEN: That's all right.\n\nLet me tell you. I - my - my record stands for itself. I\n\nnever say anything I don't mean. Everybody knows, whatever I say, I\n\ndo. And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field\n\nfor middle-class people, giving them an even break, treating Main\n\nStreet and Wall Street the same, hold them to the same responsibility.\n\nLook at my record. It's been all about the middle class.\n\nThey're the people who grow this country. We think you grow this\n\ncountry from the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we now turn to the candidates for their closing\n\nstatements. Thank you, gentlemen. And that coin toss, again, has\n\nVice President Biden starting with the closing statement.\n\nBIDEN: Well, let - let me say at the outset that I want to\n\nthank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is\n\nthat we're in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.\n\nPeople are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring relief to the\n\npeople who need the most help now.\n\nAnd - and in the process, we - in case you haven't noticed, we\n\nhave strong disagreements, but I - you probably detected my\n\nfrustration with their attitude about the American people. My friend\n\nsays that 30 percent of the American people are takers. Romney points\n\nout 47 percent of the people won't take responsibility.\n\nHe's talking about my mother and father. He's talking about the\n\nplaces I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont, and he's\n\ntalking about - he's talking about the people that have built this\n\ncountry. All they're looking for, Martha, all they're looking for is\n\nan even shot. Whenever you give them the shot, they've done it.\n\nThey've done it. Whenever you've leveled the playing field, they've\n\nbeen able to move. And they want a little bit of peace of mind.\n\nAnd the president and I are not going to rest until that playing\n\nfield is leveled, they, in fact, have a clear shot, and they have\n\npeace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree\n\nof confidence, \"Honey, it's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.\"\n\nThat's what this is all about.\n\nRADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?\n\nRYAN: I want to thank you, as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky,\n\nCentre College, and I want to thank you, Joe. It's been an honor to\n\nengage in this critical debate.\n\nWe face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to\n\nbe? What kind of country are we going to give our kids? President\n\nObama, he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda,\n\nmore spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of\n\nhealth care. It's not working. It's failed to create the jobs we\n\nneed.\n\nTwenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today.\n\nFifteen percent of Americans are in poverty. This is not what a real\n\nrecovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to\n\nearn your support. We're offering real reforms for a real recovery\n\nfor every American.\n\nMitt Romney - his experience, his ideas, his solutions - is\n\nuniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a\n\njobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job-creator in\n\nthe White House?\n\nThe choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more\n\ngovernment dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes\n\nopportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough\n\nissues, and we will not blame others for the next four years. We will\n\ntake responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding\n\nprinciples. We will reapply our founding principles.\n\nThe choice is clear, and the choice rests with you. And we ask\n\nyou for your vote. Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please\n\ntune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate at Hofstra\n\nUniversity in New York. I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope\n\nall of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.\n\n(APPLAUSE)"}

(Laughter.)\n\nSo over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.\n\nAnd I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.\n\nBut we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. We\u2019ve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we\u2019re building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nOur businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we\u2019re making progress. (Applause.)\n\nSo thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we\u2019ve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We\u2019re starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.\n\nAnd reversing this trend should be -- must be -- Washington\u2019s highest priority. It\u2019s my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)\n\nNow, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we\u2019ve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that\u2019s there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.\n\nNow, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.\n\nWe've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.\n\nI think about my grandparents\u2019 generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.\n\nAnd buying a home required responsibility on everybody\u2019s part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren\u2019t for flipping around, they weren\u2019t for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.\n\nAnd unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn\u2019t afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn\u2019t afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.\n\nBy the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.\n\nSo less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.\n\nWhere Congress wouldn\u2019t act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)\n\nWe worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called \u201cliar\u2019s loan.\u201d Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)\n\nSo because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- they\u2019re no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)\n\nAnd just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.\n\nThis morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and they\u2019re hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.\n\nSo that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.\n\nSo we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we\u2019ve got to do. (Applause.)\n\nSo I\u2019ve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasn\u2019t enacted all of them, so I\u2019d like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)\n\nBut like the other actions that we\u2019ve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn\u2019t afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.\n\nWhat we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.\n\nNumber one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today\u2019s rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. We\u2019ve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. There\u2019s no reason not to do it. (Applause.)\n\nStep number two: Now that we\u2019ve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can\u2019t afford, let\u2019s make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we\u2019re simplifying overlapping regulations; we\u2019re cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they\u2019ve worked hard to repair their credit.\n\nAnd step three is something that you don\u2019t always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It\u2019s got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.\n\nSo I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let\u2019s go ahead and get this done.\n\nStep number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let\u2019s put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country\u2019s help to get back on their feet.\n\nStep five: We should make sure families that don\u2019t want to buy a home or can\u2019t yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) It\u2019s important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there\u2019s nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.\n\nIn the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren\u2019t ready and didn't have the payments. That\u2019s a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let\u2019s invest in affordable rental housing. Let\u2019s bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)\n\nSo if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren\u2019t yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.\n\nBut -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we can\u2019t just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)\n\nAnd one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was \u201cheads we win, tails you lose.\u201d And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.\n\nSo the good news is, right now there\u2019s a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.\n\nFirst, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)\n\nBut in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.\n\nA second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)\n\nThe third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That\u2019s something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)\n\nNumber four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today\u2019s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.\n\nAnd we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)\n\nSince I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, you\u2019re on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)\n\nBut we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)\n\nSo here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.\n\nWe're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they\u2019re shopping for a mortgage. They\u2019re designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nAnd the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.\n\nWhen it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nation\u2019s top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)\n\nSo I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We\u2019ll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)\n\nAnd if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child\u2019s height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)\n\nWe can do all this if we work together. And it won\u2019t be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\nAnd as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)\n\nEND 1:35 P.M. MST"}

So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.\n\nThe Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)\n\nBut before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:\n\n\u2022 In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.\n\n\u2022 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn\u2019t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.\n\n\u2022 After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn\u2019t exist at the time).\n\n\u2022 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\n\n\u2022 The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.\n\nAccording to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.\n\n\"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\"\n\nIn April 1991, Sanders\u2019 then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.\n\n\"Bernie\u2019s response is that he doesn\u2019t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"It\u2019s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\"\n\nThe Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders\u2019 own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.\n\n\"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents\u2019 preferences so does not make gun control a priority.\"\n\n\"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line \u2013 and angering both sides through the years,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. \"Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.\"\n\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders\u2019 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.\n\nHere are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):\n\nSanders\u2019 moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn\u2019t consider Sanders \"an anti-gunner,\" and he\u2019s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn\u2019t a \"gun lobby lapdog.\"\n\nExperts agreed that on guns, Sanders\u2019 views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.\n\n\"When it comes to guns, he\u2019s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O\u2019Malley or Hillary Clinton,\" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. \"Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don\u2019t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn attack ad said, \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\nThe Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.\n\nExperts noted Sanders\u2019 votes were representative of Vermont\u2019s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True."}

And it looks like the action is heating up a little bit behind me as well, as people are coming in before they head to work to cast their votes today.\n\n\n\nJOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Good for them. I'm John Roberts. We're at the Atlanta diner here in Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody voting here, but they are fueling up in preparation to get out there and vote. It's as close as we'll come to a national primary. Well, at least this year. 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates up for grabs for the Republicans. 1,681 available for the Democrats. Most polls are open right now. We're going to be checking in with voters and our reporters across the country this morning. And we have got them from stem to stern here.\n\n\n\nGot our team on the issues talking to voters from coast to coast. Candy Crowley is live in Harlem this morning. Ed Lavandera in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chris Lawrence in San Francisco and Mary Snow is in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\n\n\nNo primary are caucus there in West Virginia, rather. A state Republican convention that gets under way in about an hour at 9:00 Eastern. 18 delegates at stake there today. And Mary joins us now live from Charleston.\n\n\n\nMary, we were speaking with Mitt Romney this morning who flew overnight from California. There really seems to be a battle in the Republican Party on this Super Tuesday as to who is the real conservative.\n\n\n\nMARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that really is what it comes down to, John, for Mitt Romney. He has been hammering away at that theme -- that trying to portray himself as the real conservative. Trying to poke holes in Senator John McCain's conservative credentials. Mitt Romney will try to make that case here in West Virginia.\n\n\n\nAs you mentioned, the convention getting under way just about an hour from now. This will likely be where we'll hear the first results across the country. Ron Paul is also going to be here. Mike Huckabee. Senator John McCain will not be here, but he will have a surrogate here for him. He is heading out to California before heading home to Arizona. Yesterday he concentrated on the northeast.\n\n\n\nOne of his big themes has been national security. Also cutting government spending. But in terms of the Republican Party, he's trying to make the case, that he can be the uniter. Mitt Romney took his message to California trying to tout his conservative credentials.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hey, we should point out, Mary, that we're looking at that polling place in Chappaqua right now. And there Hillary Clinton and her husband coming in to cast their votes. No question who she'll be voting for this morning. But let's go back to the Republican contest.\n\n\n\nWhere do these candidates need to do well? Obviously, John McCain wants to win the whole thing and become the de facto nominee tonight. But where do the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee have to do well to stay in this race?\n\n\n\nSNOW: Well, you know, for Mitt Romney, one of the states where he really has to do well is Massachusetts. John McCain was campaigning there. Mitt Romney had been governor. He says he plans on winning there. But that would be a blow to him if he did not win in Massachusetts. And obviously, he's counting a lot in California.\n\n\n\nMike Huckabee wants to gain support here in the south. He's been concentrating on that. And Ron Paul has been focusing on states like West Virginia, also Alaska. He's hoping to pick up delegates.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. Mary Snow for us this morning. Let's take it back to Kiran, who is there at Harlem.\n\n\n\nKiran, you spoke with Senator Clinton a couple of hours ago. She's there casting her ballot in Chappaqua this morning. It took just a couple of seconds as well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Yes, that's right. She actually went on early, joining us in the 6:00 hour because it's the 7:00 hour here in New York. She wanted to be at the polling site. Senator Clinton casting her vote just a few minutes ago. And earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, she talked about issues like health care and the economy and a last-minute appeal to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Really are not taking care of people. I want to put the American people first again. And you know, I think there is a lot of reason for people to worry that the president just doesn't pay attention. And I want them to know that I get it and I'll be there for them, if they are willing to go out and vote for me today. And I hope everybody watching will do that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Also a big question today, what do people in the south want in their president. Can Mike Huckabee win beyond Arkansas and can Barack Obama win beyond South Carolina? Tennessee, one of the states we're watching in the south. The polls just opened there moments ago.\n\n\n\nThere are 52 Republican delegates at stake there. 68 for the Democrats and our Ed Lavandera is in Chattanooga. He's been talking with voters this morning. You know, you can't really lump everybody in the same group and say what are southerners thinking this morning. But what is the sense here getting from this that you talk to, Ed?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, in speaking with several political analysts who look at these voters in the south, they really see, kind of a divide, between what they call the upper south and the lower south. So you have Arkansas and Tennessee perhaps going one way, maybe voting more alike and then, you have, Georgia and Alabama perhaps being a little bit more similar. But across the south, a big turnout is expected.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Presidential candidates pour on the southern charm like thick gravy on biscuits.\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not often that a razorback comes to Tuscaloosa and has a good time.\n\n\n\nJOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my sons attended Vanderbilt University. And he married a beautiful, beautiful young lady from Cookeville. And I am so -- and I am so proud of that as well. So, as you can see, I'm puling out all the stops here everybody.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: But in the south, candidates know it takes a spiritual connection, too.\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know most folks were already in church today. So I don't want to give a whole another sermon. And I won't pass the collection plate.\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day, I strive to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Across the Super Tuesday southern states of Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama, both Obama and Clinton Democrats are embracing the most popular theme on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like there's a lot of change that needs to happen as, you know, for the whole country. Not just for the south.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And some Republican leaning voters remain undecided.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: John McCain, I kind of leaning toward him in his military service and I like some of the policies that he's put forth. But Huckabee, right now, I'm leaning kind of heavy toward him.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: Emory University professor Merrill Black studies the mind-set of southern voters and on Super Tuesday, he sees division on the Democratic side.\n\n\n\nMERLE BLACK, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I think we're going to see a split here. The Deep South is probably going to go for Obama. The Upper South will probably go for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And on the Republican side, he says McCain is in the driver's seat.\n\n\n\nBLACK: McCain probably will lead the field, but I think Huckabee could be competitive here. The big question mark is how well Mitt Romney would run in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: And Kiran, you know, there's one voter in all of the south that many people would like to know, how this particular person is voting, al least, on the Democratic side and that is Former Vice President Al Gore who is from Tennessee, of course.\n\n\n\nWe reached out to his people yesterday and they said that -- we were told that he has already voted. He voted early. But we gave the old college try to find out who he voted for and we were told as a private citizen, he's not sharing that information.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: I am sure that everybody can make a few guesses, but he's keeping mum. All right, Ed Lavandera for us in Chattanooga this morning. Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on eight minutes after the hour now. Will weather affect voter turnout on this Super Tuesday? Our Rob Marciano is checking it out for us this morning.\n\n\n\nRob, anybody going to have a difficult time getting out to the polls today?\n\n\n\n(WEATHER REPORT)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: We're at the beginning of CNN's nonstop Super Tuesday coverage. 40 hours, all day and all night. And join us for a special early edition of AMERICAN MORNING, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And join CNN's Campbell Brown for her \"AMERICA VOTES SPECIAL\" talking to candidates and the issues. That's at noon Eastern on CNN and cnn.com.\n\n\n\nKiran?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Well, we've heard from three possible presidents this morning about the issues. What can they do for you? And we're breaking down, what they told us when it comes to key issues like health care and the economy.\n\n\n\nAlso, Super Tuesday meets the mortgage meltdown. The states voting today where the housing crisis has hit hardest. And how the candidates are promising to fix it? We're going to compare some of their plans. That's coming up ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Welcome back. We've been hearing from the candidates this morning. Let's take a moment to go through what we heard. Senior political correspondent Candy Crowley joins me in Harlem this morning. Breaking down what Democrats talked about. One of the key issues, this morning that we heard from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on health care. And let's just hear quickly what Barack Obama said just moments ago to John Roberts.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: What we do is set up a plan that allows anybody to get health care that is as good as health care to the members of Congress. We will subsidize it for those who can't afford it. People won't be able to be excluded from pre-existing conditions. So that, anybody who is self-employed, anybody who doesn't health insurance or is underinsured can join this plan. Now, we also work to lower costs for those who already have health insurance.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It seems like, well, they are quite similar, Barack Obama is not going as far as saying that people would be mandated to get it if they can afford it. Hillary Clinton is, although, it's still unclear exactly how that would be enforced. But who is winning on this issue? And is this an issue that would sway voters?\n\n\n\nCANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they think -- meaning in the camp Hillary, they believe this really is a winning issue. Because she goes out and says -- you know, this is a basic, fundamental Democratic issue. We've got to start with universal health care. He sort of pushes back, as you hear, and says -- listen, I have universal health care. That's where they are going.\n\n\n\nI think Democratic voters look at this and say, they are both headed in the same direction. While there are issues in this campaign that divide them, there are about 95 percent in agreement about these issues. And they are 100 percent in agreement as to the direction they want to go.\n\n\n\nSo in the end, I think Democratic voters come to the polls and sort of say, you know, we have this one candidate who is campaigning on experience. We have another who promises to turn the page. Which direction do we want to go?\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You also -- when we were talking briefly before the break, said that, you know, for the Democrats, it's also the issue of who can win it for us this year. And how do the candidates prove that at this point?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, it's all about electability at this point. And because in the end, what Democrats want is to win the oval office. So they are looking at who is the toughest and that's why you see Barack Obama now talking about John McCain, about electability. You hear him saying, you know, we don't want someone who is divisive, read that Hillary Clinton. She talks about how battle warned she is. How she knows who to go after these Republicans because they've come after her.\n\n\n\nSo they're both, in their own way, saying I'm the more electable. And that in the end is really what Democratic voters want to know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: She says, according to her, dug up all the dirt they could possibly dig up. So now they're going to go after the fresh meat.\n\n\n\nThe other interesting element about this is just the way that the Democratic primary caucuses and primaries play out. It's a different situation in terms of gathering delegates. So what does that mean and who gets the advantage, if that's the case?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: You know, first of all, it's so arcane. As you know, it's almost impossible to explain. But basically, what candidates can win a state and still lose the delegates because it's proportionately by district. So what we have to look at tonight is, first of all, who wins the states because in some ways, that's the headline.\n\n\n\nYou know, in these 20-something states, so and so wins 11 or 12. But the bottom line is that they need 2,050 votes to win this nomination. So they are all counting delegates. And I have to tell you, they are counting delegates district by district. It's why you see Barack Obama in New York. Probably Hillary Clinton will win New York, but if he can sink off enough delegates, then -- you know, he's got something there. Same with Illinois. They, in fact, think that New York will cancel out Illinois. His obviously, his home state.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It is interesting that all the four possible presidential hopefuls, all of them are Super Tuesday states. They are from Super Tuesday states.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Right. And so you start out thinking, OK, at least here I can do well.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Right. There's a victory somewhere.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Exactly.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Candy, great to see you as always. Thanks.\n\n\n\nJohn? ROBERTS: Coming up, Kiran, to 17 minutes after the hour. Of course, for the last three weeks, we've been crisscrossing the nation, stopping in at diners in small towns and big cities talking to undecided voters. We've got an undecided voter this morning at the Atlanta Diner.\n\n\n\nThis is Trina Hackett. I was saying very famous name in New Zealand. They are the people who invented bungee jumping. And you are about to take a leap today. Cast your vote for -- I assume...\n\n\n\nTRINA HACKETT, UNDECIDED DEMOCRAT: Hillary.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Hillary and why is that? You were undecided just a little while ago. What made up your mind here?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I was not truly made my mind. But it's like I'm saying -- more of saying she is very focused and very outstanding with everything that's going on. And more or less, she stands out more because of -- she looks out for the little people. You know -- and she's more focused on the little people. And, you know, and making sure that, you know, that -- life is going to be more easy for them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So what's the number one issue for you in this one?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: The number one issue for me is, more or less, health care. You know, for everyone, that's not being able to afford and everything.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Have you really looked into the differences between the two plans? As we've been saying this morning, there's not that great of difference.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: There's not that great of difference but -- you know, we've seen who is going to stand out. You know, who is going to make it stick. You know, what I mean? Who is going to just really, really just make it known to bring to existence, other than talk about it, but make it realistic.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And do you think -- is that based on experience that she has?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: More to say, yes. Yes. I have seen she's more -- you know, sticking around the people to understand and get to know them more better. Stand beside them.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: You know, when we were in California all the way across the country, last week, one of the big issues for people was electability. Who can actually win the White House? Who do you think has the edge on that front?\n\n\n\nHACKETT: I would say, Hillary. She's pretty much got it like, you know, hand packed because the more or less, I more saw her face more than I did Obama because -- I mean, I didn't know of him until he just came to run for president. You know, other than that, I was like, I didn't know him at all. ROBERTS: Obviously, she's been around for awhile. Interesting too, though, we should note that the latest polls have got Obama leading by a substantial margin here in Georgia. So if you want Hillary to win, I guess you better get out there and cast your vote.\n\n\n\nTrina Hackett, thanks very much for being with us. It's great to see you. Appreciate it. Get out there and vote today.\n\n\n\nHACKETT: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So California, across the country again. The big prize in this Super Tuesday on the west coast. What are voters there thinking? We take a cross-country trip coming up to show you.\n\n\n\nAnd the mortgage crisis. We've heard some of the candidates talking about it. What are their plans to fix the situation?\n\n\n\nGerri Willis will be here to tell us all about that, coming up on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Many of the states voting today are states that had been hit hard in the foreclosure crisis. We have been looking at the candidates' plans to fix it. And CNN's Gerri Willis in a hard-hit neighborhood of Atlanta this morning.\n\n\n\nGerri, what are you finding there?\n\n\n\nGERRI WILLIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey there, John. Yes, I'm in an Atlanta neighborhood where the foreclosures are highest. This zip code has the highest number of foreclosures in this city. Check out this house right behind me. It's bank-owned as you can see. Now, John, this is a largely working class community, if you can take a look at down the street here. Of the 85 homes on this street alone, some 24 are in foreclosure or have been in foreclosure.\n\n\n\nNow, the neighborhood leaders are trying to take back the community. They say much of the problem here has been the result of mortgage fraud. And John, as you've been saying all morning, of course, what's going on here is going on across the country in Super Tuesday states all over the country. No place has been hit harder than California where 1 in 52 homes is in foreclosure. Big number there. And they've lost as much as $61 billion in values in homes but also tax revenues. Lost tax revenues.\n\n\n\nAs you know, the industry provides incredible tax revenues for local governments. Other states affected here as well. You can see Colorado. We've mentioned Georgia, Arizona and Illinois.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right. So we know how the scope of the problem here, Gerri, because you've been doing some great reporting on it. But what are the candidates planning to try to do to fix it? WILLIS: Well, the person who's probably been most outspoken on the mortgage meltdown is probably Hillary Clinton. She came out with legislation last year to try to clean up the problem. She wanted the big bailout, actually, to solve the issue. Here's what she said recently about what should be done.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes. And I want to freeze interest rates for five years.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWILLIS: Freeze interest rates so the people could actually work their way out of these adjustable rate mortgages which have been so difficult for folks.\n\n\n\nAlso, Obama, has also been outspoken on this topic, also introduced legislation. He wants a $10 billion bailout for the issue and he also wants to make sure that people get mortgage tax credits whether they itemize or not.\n\n\n\nNow the Republicans have been very insistent on no government. They bailout of the folks in this crisis. They think private sector solutions are the best. One little bit difference there, one change, John McCain has opened the window to some possible Federal government involvement, if the issue isn't solved by the president's current plans that are working their way through communities all across the country.\n\n\n\nJohn?\n\n\n\nROBERTS: All right, Gerri Willis for us this morning. Gerri, thanks very much. Now back to Harlem and here's Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: You know, there were nearly 16 million registered voters in California. What's most important to them as they choose a candidate this morning? We're on the road, taking a road trip to find out.\n\n\n\nAlso, Kevin Everett, the Buffalo Bills player defied the odds in his recovery from what was describes as a catastrophic collision on the field. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the medical milestones that Kevin's made.\n\n\n\nHey, Sanjay.\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Kiran. A spinal cord injury is what he had. A lot of people have heard of that. But why do some people get to walk away when so many others don't. I'll break it down for you and tell you what help Kevin. AMERICAN MORNING is coming right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We're back from the Atlanta Diner this morning in Atlanta, Georgia. A big Super Tuesday state. This is the big prize in the south. 87 Democratic delegates available. 72 on the Republican side. And people came in this morning for some eggs and grits and headed out to cast their vote. Welcome back to AMERICAN MORNING. February 5th, Super Tuesday. I'm John Roberts in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Hey, good to see you, John. We're here at the Adam Clayton Powell School in Harlem, New York. Of course, New York another huge state on this Super Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates up for grabs, especially on the Democratic side. We've seen people trickling in and out of here 2 1/2 hours ago, is when the polls opened. It's going to be a busy day not only here but at polling sites across the nation because it is Super Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAnd it's as close as we'll come to a national primary. There are 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates for the Republicans and 1,681 delegates available for the Democrats. There's a look at the big picture map. People are already starting to line up across the northeast. Let's take a look at some of the places. How about West Hartford, Connecticut, Fort Lee, New Jersey, and also across the river from here in queens. We'll be checking back with voters as well as our reporters who have you covered from coast to coast this morning.\n\n\n\nGetting back to New Jersey now. Polls have been open there for about 2 1/2 hours as well. There are 52 delegates at stake for republicans in New Jersey. 127 for democrats and the race is special. Independent voters are allowed to cast ballots. For example, here in New York, they cannot. The closed primaries in New York state. The candidates are aiming for some of those independents. Jason Carroll is at a polling station in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to break it down for us this morning. Hi, Jason.\n\n\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: And hello to you, Kiran. You know, if you are an independent and you show up here at a fire station like this, which is a polling place, that's why you hear the alarms going off. It is a working fire station, Kiran. But it is a polling place. But if you are an independent that shows up here, you have to declare either democrat or republican before you can cast your vote. The democratic race here much too close to call. Senator Barack Obama campaigned in east Rutherford yesterday where he was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy. It's the second major rally that he has attended in northern New Jersey within the past month.\n\n\n\nSenator Clinton supporters say that she has a slight lead here in the state. Even so, she dispatched Chelsea Clinton out to do some campaigning for her on the republican side. Senator John McCain has a double-digit lead over Romney in the state but McCain still stopping through Trenton yesterday to do some last-minute campaigning. Romney sending out his son to do campaigning in the state as well. As you know, Kiran, New Jersey actually moved its primary up so they could have more impact on the presidential nominee. We spoke to some voters this morning about how that's impacting them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of sad when years past when you feel like your vote doesn't count.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a different year than usual. There are a lot of choices. And it seems that it would really make a difference.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of issues domestically we have to take care of. So with that, I think it makes it more important than ever.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCARROLL: And Kiran, we took our own informal poll about the top issues facing some of the voters here in New Jersey. The top two issues they said - number one, the economy; number two, the need for change. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Jason Carroll in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, this morning. Thank you.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton, by the way, already cast her vote this morning. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted just minutes ago in Westchester county, the hometown of Chappaqua, about 30 miles north of us here in Harlem. Earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, I talked to her about some of the problems with the economy and asked what she would do to fix them.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Another huge issue for people and that's the economy, recession. Some people argue we're already in one. Others say we need to pass some sort of stimulus plan and quickly to avoid one if that's the case. Right now, the House has a version. You're going to be heading back to Washington to vote on a Senate version. And meanwhile, there is talk that perhaps the longer this takes, the less effective it is. What would you do right now to try to stem the economic troubles we seem to be getting into?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I would have a very aggressive policy toward trying to stop home foreclosures. Again, I'm the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year. We need to put a moratorium on foreclosures to help people stay in their homes and we need to freeze these interest rates that continue to escalate, driving more and more people into foreclosure. A lot of people were misled. They were the victim of predatory lending practices, and we need to stabilize the housing market.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Senator Clinton also said she thinks the country is on the brink of a recession. And the Senate must get a stimulus plan through as a first step. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Coming up on 34 minutes after the hour, Kiran, Senator Barack Obama is heading back to his hometown of Chicago for a rally tonight. We had a chance to speak with him in the last hour of AMERICAN MORNING, talk about issues like Iraq and the difference between his health care plan and Senator Clinton's.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: She suggests you are falling short here by mandating coverage for children but not mandating it for their parents. What do you say?\n\n\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's break down what she really means by a mandate. What's meant by a mandate is that the government is forcing people to buy health insurance and so she's suggesting a parent is not going to buy health insurance for themselves if they can afford it. Now, my belief is that most parents will choose to get health care for themselves and we make it affordable.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: In an Obama White House, what would that strategic relationship with Iraq look like?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I think, first of all, it will not have us setting up permanent bases and a permanent occupation in Iraq for decades which is what George Bush's suggested but also John McCain. I think it is important for us to say to the Iraqis that we are willing to help them. We want to be partners with them, but we are not going to be there in perpetuity. And I have been very clear. I will end this war. We will get combat troops out. I hope to do it by the end of 2009.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Senator Obama also refused to say whether he'd join a combined ticket with Hillary Clinton. He said his focus now is winning the nomination and then trying to unite the country.\n\n\n\nWell, California is a big piece of the puzzle today. Polls opened at 7:00 Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern and the republicans going after 170 delegates for the democrats' 370 are at stake. And there is no winner take all. Delegates will be awarded by congressional district making it a lot more -- making it more like a lot of mini elections instead of just one big one. So what issues are driving the voters? Our Chris Lawrence hit the road to find out. He is live for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, good morning.\n\n\n\nCHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. You know, 1 out of every 8 Americans lives in California. That gives you an idea of the sheer size of this primary. And the voters here are making their decisions based on immigration, health care and most of all, the economy.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE (voice-over): 80 miles east of L.A., Betty Larkins is packing up. After the bank foreclosed on her home.\n\n\n\nBETTY LARKINS: People are saying something about a recession might come. To me, we're in one.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty beat cancer, but she's losing her home because she went broke paying hospital bills.\n\n\n\nLARKINS: See, I didn't even know what it cost for a mammogram until I didn't have insurance.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Based on her health care plans, she's narrowed it down to Obama and Clinton.\n\n\n\nLARKINGS: But I have to pray about it a lot before I make my decision.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Betty is just one member of the country's most diverse electorate. And California is super Tuesday's biggest prize. There are more people living in Los Angeles county than the entire state of Michigan. We wanted to hear from even more of California's nearly 16 million registered voters, and they are spread out all over the state.\n\n\n\nDriving hundreds of miles to the more agricultural area around Fresno, we found problems for one front-runner.\n\n\n\nJOE MENDOZA, UNDECIDED VOTER: McCain is wishy washy.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Joe Mendoza hasn't decided which other republican he'll vote for.\n\n\n\nMENDOZA: Immigration is a big factor with me right now. To see what they are going to do. This country can't keep sending all our jobs off.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: The next day, we're back on the road to the Bay Area where all that Clinton-Obama advertising has some new company.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, the GOP is awarding delegates to the winner in each congressional district. So republican candidates are campaigning in heavily democratic areas like San Francisco because even a small number there could deliver a win.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you are more part of the process.\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: This registered republican is voting for Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Iraq is going to take care of itself with the surge. It's working. But I care about people who are going to actually create jobs. Keep taxes down so that companies can grow.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nLAWRENCE: Yes, one thing about California, a lot of the voters, in fact perhaps half of the voters will vote by absentee ballots. A lot of us who live here, our friends and our family, have already voted. With that in mind, two things to keep in mind today. Barack Obama's late surge and Mitt Romney's conservative challenge to John McCain. How much effect will they really have on the vote totals? John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: It's really becoming an incredibly tight race there. Chris Lawrence for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, thanks. Kiran.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: A lot of people may still have, John, last-minute questions about the candidates. Not sure where to go to vote today or exactly who they're going to vote for. We have the most up-to-the- minute information for you. Super Tuesday information just ahead.\n\n\n\nAnd also, we see the amazing story of Kevin Everett of the Buffalo Bills. The progress he has made after a spinal cord injury that first was described as catastrophic. How did he and his doctors do it? We're paging our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Oh, hey, we're back. We're back here at the Adam Clayton Powell Elementary, one of the voting sites here in New York today. There's a pretty healthy turnout so far. Polls open here about 6:00 Eastern time. It opened for a little more than 2 1/2 hours right now. Steady stream of people. We wanted to talk to some of the voters and see why they chose the way they did this morning. And joining us is Khalid Kamau. He recently transplanted from Atlanta. You said you were tired of living in a red state. You wanted to move to New York. You work for a non-profit organization right here in Harlem. Tell us a little bit about what went into picking a candidate today.\n\n\n\nKHALID KAMAU, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Well, my roommates and I, we all watched all the debates. We're like tivoing and going back and forth. But just listening to the positions was really - I really felt I can say who I voted for - Hillary - I just felt on the issue that was most important to me, which was health care and several other issues. She really articulated a very detailed position. And, you know, I was really torn, especially after the whole like South Carolina debacle with like Barack and Bill, but --\n\n\n\nCHETRY: Did that turn you off a little what went on in South Carolina, the issues of race?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Yes, it definitely did. I mean, just I think that everyone, you know, would love to see a president or an executive that looks like them. You know, in representative government that's true representation. But I really just felt that she just had a little bit better articulation of some of the issues that were really important, you know.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: When you talk about that, this is an issue that Barack Obama himself has talked about and said, I don't really want this to be an issue of race. I don't want people to vote for me just because I could be the first black president. Were those issues of race something that you -- that you took into consideration?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: Oh, yes, of course. You can't - I think as much as and you hear a lot of pundits, even reporters saying - you know, talk about how Barack transcends race. I just, we're not there as a country yet where we can just transcend. We can't vote for Barack and the past 400 years of history would like all be fixed. And it's the same thing with, I think, sexism and Hillary Clinton. So it really -- that's always just going to play a huge part.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: But for you, it came down to the individual person and what they were proposing to make your life better?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: It is really is. It really came down to health care. And I just think that we have to - I think Hillary is right when she says that we have to try to cover everyone. You know we have to at least start there.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: It's interesting because your mother actually voted for Barack Obama. So you guys had healthy debates over the dinner table?\n\n\n\nKAMAU: She did. We were actually a Hillary family. My mother and father. We were all very pro-Hillary. I think everything kind of turned in South Carolina. And I didn't know actually until this morning when I called her that she changed her vote. But I think that it's just - I don't know. It's just really a profound thing. I think a lot of people are even split with the delegates. I think that every year, every election cycle, it seems like they are finding out some new critical piece of this elaborate election mechanism.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: That's right. But every vote counts. And you certainly cast yours for Hillary. Khalid Kamau, thanks so much for joining us. And you know, it's very interesting, John, just how informed people are for this primary and for this upcoming general election. As you heard from Khalid, he watched every debate, tivoed it if he didn't see it. And that is what we're hearing from a lot of voters. They want, they're hungry for the type of information and they know that they're taking part in an historical decision. John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Yes. All you have to do is look at the ratings for our debates to know that people have really been dialed in. We talked to so many people across the country and they are so excited on the republican side and the democratic side about participating in this election.\n\n\n\nWe've been talking about the incredible recovery of Kevin Everett from the Buffalo Bills. Just five months after suffering a spinal cord injury during the Bills' home opener. Kevin Everett is walking again now. He told Kiran it's a recovery that no one would have predicted.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKEVIN EVERETT, BUFFALO BILLS: That's my collar.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Unfortunately, we had a little problem with that. But he said people didn't give him much of a chance to recover and he came back. How did Everett and his doctors do it? We're paging Dr. Sanjay Gupta for that. Sanjay joins us now. How did they do it?\n\n\n\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's not sure exactly what happened here. There's obviously a lot of people have spinal cord injuries who never recover the way he did. But I tell you, he's a pretty happy guy there. Dominik Hickson, by the way, who tackled him is very happy guy as well because Kevin is walking. We know several things about his recovery. One is that he got a very early surgery. His operation was quickly. That's important. He also got this therapy, known as hypothermic therapy, actually cooling his spinal cord, cooling his body. Although it's unclear exactly when that was instituted. But take a look at the timeline here. Now, the operation and the injury at the end of September. He had the operation within ten days, he was in a rehabilitation facility. Within week two, he was able to take some steps with a walker. Within week three, standing on his own. By October 30th, he was getting out of bed and eventually on November 18th, he was discharged. So pretty speedy recovery, John. But again, out of which of those things actually made the difference? It's really unclear.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Why did he recover when so many others don't?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Well, you know, you talk about this hypothermic therapy, which is essentially cooling the spinal cord. A lot of people say that's just anecdotal. There's no sort of scientific evidence that works. In his case in particular, what we know is that he got the hypothermic therapy started after the surgery, according to the neurosurgeon who took care of him. So, it's hard to say if that made a difference. He also had a central cord injury, John. It's a type of spinal cord injury from which a lot of people do recover. In fact, in his age group, over 90% of people do recover to some extent.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: How has that different from the debilitating type of injury like Christopher Reeve's?\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Right, you're talking about complete spinal cord injury where the entire spinal cord is crushed to some extent. In Kevin Everett's case, according to his rehab doctors, he suffered more of a central spinal cord injury where it's more of a bruising. Think of it as a bruising to the spinal cord where the central most fibers of the spinal cord are the most damaged. The crucial thing there is, John, if you follow those patients over time, a lot of them do recover as long as they have the surgery and the time.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: And you should know all about this, Mr. Neurosurgeon.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Obviously, happy for him. He'll walk again. Hard to say if he'll play football again but he's going to walk again.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: He said he's going to get into some businesses and see how it goes after that. Sanjay, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nGUPTA: Thanks.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: CNN NEWSROOM just minutes away now. Heidi Collins down the street at the CNN Center with a look at what's ahead.

John.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: So will weather affect voter turnout on this super Tuesday? There's some bad weather moving into parts of the country. Our Rob Marciano checking it out for us this morning from the CNN weather center just down the street. Good morning, Rob.\n\n\n\nROB MARCIANO, CNN, METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John. Yes, we got a big storm that's running across the country. It's going to bring the gamut as far as weather is concerned through a number of states holding their primaries and caucuses. Kansas, Oklahoma, you'll be under the gun for snow. And after some morning rain and thunderstorms and severe thunderstorms expected across Arkansas and through the mid-Mississippi River Valley, western parts of Tennessee, we could very well see damaging winds and violent tornadoes, especially in Arkansas. Where the storm's prediction center has just upgraded their outlook for today to a high-risk area. That is very rare for this time of year, especially this far north.\n\n\n\nThe main reason, among other things. We got strong winds at the midlevels. We got a lot of heat, 67 Little Rock. 69 degrees in Dallas. And a lot of cold behind that. 32 degrees in Amarillo and 17 degrees right now in Denver, Colorado. So cold mixing with the warm and you got the fireworks, that's for sure.\n\n\n\nWe have severe thunderstorm watch out for north Texas. Likely a tornado watch issued in about an hour for Arkansas and behind the system we have snow. Eastern Colorado through Kansas back through Illinois. Winter storm warnings are posted for several inches of snow possible and then storms extend towards the east coast. Looks like it will be wet for much of New York state. A lot of action. A lot of bad weather to folks heading to the polls. Don't let it discourage you. It will be gorgeous here in parts of the southeast. But if you have some weather to deal with, tell the folks to get out there and get it done.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Boy, bundle up in Colorado today. Rob, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nMARCIANO: All right.\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Quickly now to what CNN NEWSROOM is working on for the top of the hour.\n\n\n\nCOLLINS: See these stories in the CNN NEWSROOM.

Tornadoes possible from Texas to the lower Midwest.\n\n\n\nBaseball's Roger Clemens on Capitol Hill and under oath about steroids.\n\n\n\nA ticker tape parade today for the \"Super Bowl\" champion New York Giants. And a boy seriously stuck in a washing machine. NEWSROOM top of the hour on CNN.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's going to wrap it up for us and our tour of the battleground states leading into super Tuesday. A little bittersweet moment. But Kiran and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m.\n\n\n\nCHETRY: That's right. Finally, John is coming back to New York City. We miss you.

EDT\n\nMR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nIn our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.\n\nWhat happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n\nAnd that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.\n\nExpanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with \u201cA\u201d ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It\u2018s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\nWe'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.\n\nWe take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.\n\nOn behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Connecticut\u2019s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They\u2019ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.\n\nWe will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.\n\nWe leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.\n\nThank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who\u2019s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers \u2013- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.\n\nFamilies that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders \u2013- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We\u2019re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.\n\nAnd a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it\u2019s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.\n\nA majority of senators voted \u201cyes\u201d to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m going to speak plainly and honestly about what\u2019s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -\u2013 both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with \u201cA\u201d grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.\n\nTheir legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she\u2019s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.\n\nIn fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn\u2019t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That\u2019s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.\n\nBut instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of \u201cbig brother\u201d gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they\u2019re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.\n\nBut the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn\u2019t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn\u2019t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn\u2019t prevent all future massacres. And that\u2019s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.\n\nAnd this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.\n\nI've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn\u2019t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?\n\nI've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \"A prop,\" somebody called them. \u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don\u2019t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?\n\nSo all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.\n\nBut this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don\u2019t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We\u2019re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We\u2019re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We\u2019re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.\n\nBut we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.\n\nTo all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don\u2019t act this time, you will remember come election time.\n\nTo the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn\u2019t represent your views on this one.\n\nThe point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They\u2019ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n\nSo to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you\u2019ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.\n\nAnd that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they\u2019ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.\n\nAnd I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We\u2019re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.\n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming that the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we\u2019ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who\u2019ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I\u2019m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I\u2019m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND 5:55 P.M. EDT"}

Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.\n\nAway from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title \u201cSenior Advisor to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. \"Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,\" he told the reporter. \"I'm not that familiar with him.\"\n\nTrump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump\u2019s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a \u201csenior advisor\" to Trump.\n\nSater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his \u201cmost prized project.\u201d For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a \"senior advisor\" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump\u2019s attorney about it, that portion of Sater\u2019s online resume was deleted.\n\nThe \u201csenior advisor\u201d title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.\n\nAlan Garten, Trump\u2019s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump \u201chad no real direct relationship with Felix Sater\u201d and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump \u201cin my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater\u2019s Trump business card with the \u201csenior advisor\u201d title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater\u2019s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles \u201cin order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.\u201d\n\nCyrus McCrimmon/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nGarten said Sater was \u201cnever employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization\u201d and that \u201cno deals ever came from those activities\u201d in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater\u2019s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.\n\nTrump\u2019s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe cast of characters who participated in Trump\u2019s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his \u201ctremendous\u201d record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.\n\nThe connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.\n\nAs Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when \u201csomebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children\u201d with a proposal for a development deal. \u201cIt could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut somebody from Bayrock.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nSater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.\u201d Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.\n\nAs he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million \u201cpump and dump\u201d stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had \u201cplanned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,\u201d the release said.\n\nProsecutors said Sater and others had \u201cenlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.\u201d\n\nSater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past \"at your own risk\" but did not cite specific concerns.\n\nDuring this period, Sater\u2019s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the \u201cchief operating officer\u201d or \u201cmanaging director.\u201d In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. \u201cI was probably number two man in the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actual position, I don't remember what it was.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.\n\nDuring this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, \u201cexquisite gardens,\u201d and \u201ca world-class celebrity chef restaurant.\u201d\n\nThe project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against \u201cthe Trump/Bayrock Organization,\u201d the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to \u201celectrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.\u201d\n\nSater\u2019s lawyer calls the allegation \u201can outright fabrication\u201d made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.\n\nReached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump\u2019s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.\n\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Garten told ABC News, \u201cMr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.\u201d\n\nSater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater\u2019s ties to Trump and describing his \u201ctangled past.\u201d The article reported that Sater \u201chad been an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.\u201d\n\nSater told the Times that activity was in the past. \u201cI\u2019m trying to lead an exemplary existence,\u201d he said then. \u201cOld, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.\u201d\n\nWhile Sater\u2019s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a \u201ccooperator\u201d on a range of matters.\n\nSater\u2019s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.\n\n\u201cThe defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,\u201d her statement said. He provided information \u201ccrucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.\u201d\n\nGarten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was \u201csurprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no idea,\u201d Garten said. It \u201cwas the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.\u201d\n\nGarten added, \u201cWhen you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it\u2019s just not appropriate.\"\n\nOnce that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump \u201ccut all ties\u201d with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.\n\nAsked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, \u201cYou\u2019re going to look at the deal, you\u2019re not going to look at the broker.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater\u2019s past, Trump said he knew Sater had \u201cgot into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.\u201d And, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well, but I don\u2019t think he was connected to the mafia.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn\u2019t say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.\n\n\u201cI hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,\u201d he said, walking out of the room.\n\nTrump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.\n\nIn August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul\u2019s past dealings with Sater. \"I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,\" Lewandowski replied. \"I've never heard of the guy.\u201d\n\nFor investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.\n\nCathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown \u2013 which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump\u2019s photos and such slogans as \"There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.\"\n\n\u201cI invested because it was Trump,\u201d Cather told ABC News.\n\nABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report."}

But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.\n\nWe decided to fact-check Rubio\u2019s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.\n\nCruz\u2019s vote on Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Cruz\u2019s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul\u2019s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Paul\u2019s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:\n\n\"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\"\n\nUnder Paul\u2019s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.\n\nWas Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?\n\nSo why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\n\n\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.\n\nBut experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\n\n\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.\n\nChristopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\n\n\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\n\n\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"\n\nBenjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\n\n\"This was a budget, so it doesn\u2019t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul\u2019s plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul\u2019s proposal for defense was below Obama\u2019s request.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False."}
{"comment_3": "The Driving Life And Death Of Philando Castile: Stopped by Police 46 times https://t.co/fYyrD5T6rg", "split": "gen", "comment_2": "AP: Philando Castile had been stopped 52 times by police since 2002 (and never convicted o\u2026 https://t.co/hJ9P7l3J0A https://t.co/qYWRwuLC7h", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Philando Castile was stopped 52 times by police https://t.co/eGaD8lE4EO via @pioneerpress", "article": "\n\n\n\n\u2014 When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn\u2019t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.\n\nHe was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.\n\nWas Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?\n\nThe answer may never be known, but Castile\u2019s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile\u2019s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.\n\nThe shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile\u2019s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.\n\nThe Castile video \u201cis pretty horrific,\u201d said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. \u201cThere are things we don\u2019t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases \u2014 whether explicit or implicit \u2014 about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.\u201d\n\nCourt records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.\n\nMany charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.\n\nThe records show no convictions for more serious crimes.\n\nNo recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.\n\nBut in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.\n\nThe analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.\n\nThe St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile\u2019s stop since shortly after the shooting.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.\n\nCastile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d after he reached for his ID.\n\nValerie Castile said she thinks her son \u201cwas just black in the wrong place.\u201d Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.\n\nThe officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.\n\n\u201cPolice understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,\u201d said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nBut the statistics can\u2019t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.\n\n\u201cWhen people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,\u201d said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. \u201cThat counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.\u201d\n\nLast year, the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.\n\nNationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nThe survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.\n\nThe precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.\n\n\u201cOur implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we\u2019re facing ambiguous situations,\u201d Fridell said. \u201cA person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren\u2019t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.\u201d\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform. And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.\n\nOur collective failure to meet this challenge \u2013 year after year, decade after decade \u2013 has led us to a breaking point. Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans. Some can't get insurance on the job. Others are self-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.\n\nWe are the only advanced democracy on Earth \u2013 the only wealthy nation \u2013 that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.\n\nBut the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.\n\nOne man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.\n\nThen there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many employers \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally \u2013 like our automakers \u2013 are at a huge disadvantage. And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it \u2013 about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care.\n\nFinally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform this system. The question is how.\n\nThere are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada's, where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone. On the right, there are those who argue that we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.\n\nI have to say that there are arguments to be made for both approaches. But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have. Since health care represents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch. And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.\n\nDuring that time, we have seen Washington at its best and its worst.\n\nWe have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week. That has never happened before. Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups and even drug companies \u2013 many of whom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber on about eighty percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.\n\nBut what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward their own government. Instead of honest debate, we have seen scare tactics. Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise. Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge. And out of this blizzard of charges and counter-charges, confusion has reigned.\n\nWell the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.\n\nThe plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:\n\nIt will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge \u2013 not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans \u2013 and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.\n\nHere are the details that every American needs to know about this plan:\n\nFirst, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.\n\nThat's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan \u2013 more security and stability.\n\nNow, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange \u2013 a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves.\n\nFor those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it.\n\nNow, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those \u2013 particularly the young and healthy \u2013 who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek \u2013 especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions \u2013 just can't be achieved.\n\nThat's why under my plan, individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance \u2013 just as most states require you to carry auto insurance. Likewise, businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care, or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers. There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage, and 95% of all small businesses, because of their size and narrow profit margin, would be exempt from these requirements. But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees. Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part.\n\nWhile there remain some significant details to be ironed out, I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined: consumer protections for those with insurance, an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage, and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life, as well as the economy as a whole. Still, given all the misinformation that's been spread over the past few months, I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform. So tonight I'd like to address some of the key controversies that are still out there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of people's concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost. The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Such a charge would be laughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.\n\nThere are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false \u2013 the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally. And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up \u2013 under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\nMy health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a \"government takeover\" of the entire health care system. As proof, critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly-sponsored insurance option, administered by the government just like Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nSo let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly \u2013 by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.\n\nInsurance executives don't do this because they are bad people. They do it because it's profitable. As one former insurance executive testified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill; they are rewarded for it. All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called \"Wall Street's relentless profit expectations.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They provide a legitimate service, and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors. I just want to hold them accountable. The insurance reforms that I've already mentioned would do just that. But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not-for-profit public option available in the insurance exchange. Let me be clear \u2013 it would only be an option for those who don't have insurance. No one would be forced to choose it, and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance. In fact, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, we believe that less than 5% of Americans would sign up.\n\nDespite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don't like this idea. They argue that these private companies can't fairly compete with the government. And they'd be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option. But they won't be. I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects. But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits, excessive administrative costs and executive salaries, it could provide a good deal for consumers. It would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.\n\nIt's worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I've proposed tonight. But its impact shouldn't be exaggerated \u2013 by the left, the right, or the media. It is only one part of my plan, and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles. To my progressive friends, I would remind you that for decades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it. The public option is only a means to that end \u2013 and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal. And to my Republican friends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government takeover of health care, we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have.\n\nFor example, some have suggested that that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas worth exploring. But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans can't find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a choice. And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinally, let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me, to members of this chamber, and to the public \u2013 and that is how we pay for this plan.\n\nHere's what you need to know. First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits \u2013 either now or in the future. Period. And to prove that I'm serious, there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize. Part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for \u2013 from the Iraq War to tax breaks for the wealthy. I will not make that same mistake with health care.\n\nSecond, we've estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system \u2013 a system that is currently full of waste and abuse. Right now, too much of the hard-earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care doesn't make us healthier. That's not my judgment \u2013 it's the judgment of medical professionals across this country. And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn fact, I want to speak directly to America's seniors for a moment, because Medicare is another issue that's been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.\n\nMore than four decades ago, this nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years. That is how Medicare was born. And it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next. That is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.\n\nThe only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies \u2013 subsidies that do everything to pad their profits and nothing to improve your care. And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.\n\nThese steps will ensure that you \u2013 America's seniors \u2013 get the benefits you've been promised. They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations. And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pocket for prescription drugs. That's what this plan will do for you. So don't pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut \u2013 especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program. That will never happen on my watch. I will protect Medicare.\n\nNow, because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system, making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody. We have long known that some places, like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, offer high-quality care at costs below average. The commission can help encourage the adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system \u2013 everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan. Much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers. This reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money \u2013 an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts. And according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long-run.\n\nFinally, many in this chamber \u2013 particularly on the Republican side of the aisle \u2013 have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care. I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs. So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine. I know that the Bush Administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual states to test these issues. It's a good idea, and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today.\n\nAdd it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over ten years \u2013 less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration. Most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent \u2013 but spent badly \u2013 in the existing health care system. The plan will not add to our deficit. The middle-class will realize greater security, not higher taxes. And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of one percent each year, it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.\n\nThis is the plan I'm proposing. It's a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight \u2013 Democrats and Republicans. And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead. If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be there to listen. My door is always open.\n\nBut know this: I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than improve it. I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are. If you misrepresent what's in the plan, we will call you out. And I will not accept the status quo as a solution. Not this time. Not now.\n\nEveryone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing. Our deficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will close. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most. And more will die as a result. We know these things to be true.\n\nThat is why we cannot fail. Because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed \u2013 the ones who suffer silently, and the ones who shared their stories with us at town hall meetings, in emails, and in letters.\n\nI received one of those letters a few days ago. It was from our beloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. He had written it back in May, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal. He asked that it be delivered upon his death.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks to the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, and his children, who are here tonight . And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform \u2013 \"that great unfinished business of our society,\" he called it \u2013 would finally pass. He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity, but he also reminded me that \"it concerns more than material things.\" \"What we face,\" he wrote, \"is above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.\"\n\nI've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days \u2013 the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry debate.\n\nFor some of Ted Kennedy's critics, his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty. In their mind, his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.\n\nBut those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here \u2013 people of both parties \u2013 know that what drove him was something more. His friend, Orrin Hatch, knows that. They worked together to provide children with health insurance. His friend John McCain knows that. They worked together on a Patient's Bill of Rights. His friend Chuck Grassley knows that. They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities.\n\nOn issues like these, Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick; and he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance; what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent \u2013 there is something that could make you better, but I just can't afford it.\n\nThat large-heartedness \u2013 that concern and regard for the plight of others \u2013 is not a partisan feeling. It is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character. Our ability to stand in other people's shoes. A recognition that we are all in this together; that when fortune turns against one of us, others are there to lend a helping hand. A belief that in this country, hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play; and an acknowledgement that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise.\n\nThis has always been the history of our progress. In 1933, when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism. But the men and women of Congress stood fast, and we are all the better for it. In 1965, when some argued that Medicare represented a government takeover of health care, members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, did not back down. They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind.\n\nYou see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem. They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom. But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, and the vulnerable can be exploited. And they knew that when any government measure, no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial, is subject to scorn; when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un-American; when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom, and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter \u2013 that at that point we don't merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges. We lose something essential about ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat was true then remains true today. I understand how difficult this health care debate has been. I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them. I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road \u2013 to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one more term.\n\nBut that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test.\n\nBecause that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our character. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of America."}

The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the impact of this statute, if any, on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, in rural communities from non-negligent local sellers.

(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nThe House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law \u2014 and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obama's failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for \"voluntary return\" to their home countries.\n\nA law known as the \"William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\" gave that right only to children from counties \"contiguous\" to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 among other parts of Central America \u2014 Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms. \"All the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,\" Cuellar told a group of reporters. \"The only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.\"\n\nMembers of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.\n\n\"We agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,\" they wrote, \"and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\"\n\nCuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with \"a little bit of experience\" \u2014 a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican \u2014 would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.\n\nObama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.\n\nBut most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.\n\n\"I think there's ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \"I think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.\"\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday \u2014 and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.\n\nHe said he had \"suspected all along\" that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama's pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.\n\n\"We need to take a position that protects children,\" Grijalva said, \"and a Republican effort ... to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.\"\n\nRelated stories: President's Party Asks Why He's Avoiding the Border Obama 'Happy to Consider' Sending National Guard to Border to get Votes on Supplemental A Tale of Two Congressional Visits to the Southwest Border Obama\u2019s Bill for Border Surge Gets Frosty Reception on the Right Obama Asking Congress for $4.3 Billion for Border Crisis, Wildfires On Climate Change, Landrieu Stands With Coal, Against Obama Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone."}

He's president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nWelcome to the NewsHour.\n\nDAVID KEENE, National Rifle Association: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, earlier on the program, we heard from the governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, who said the critics who argue that what they're trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that it's an attack on the Second Amendment are not right. He said, what we're simply doing are commonsense safety measures.\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's what Michael Bloomberg says.\n\nNo, it is an attack on the Second Amendment. It is an attack on those Americans who purchased and legally use firearms, who have never committed a criminal act, who have never done anything wrong. And they can say that it doesn't infringe upon their rights, but, in fact, it does.\n\nNow, every amendment -- the First Amendment -- you can't, famously, yell fire in a crowded theater. The Second Amendment is also subject to reasonable limits. The Supreme Court has held that. But they're strictly looked at.\n\nAnd you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that they're really necessary. And the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good. They're asking the question, Judy, what do we do about guns? The question should be, what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in Connecticut?\n\nAnd we don't think that they're asking that question, but they're pursuing their own agenda.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say that's what they're doing.\n\nDAVID KEENE: I know they do.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And let me just quickly read from something that Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded. Mark Kelly, her husband.\n\nThey wrote an op-ed article just a few days ago. They say, people who are just -- he said: \"Special interests have cast -- have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties.\"\n\nAnd they say, as a result, more people are vulnerable to gun violence.\n\nDAVID KEENE: You know, they're talking about what they call assault weapons. Actually, an assault weapon, so-called, wasn't involved in the Giffords shooting.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield. They're not. They're semiautomatic commercial rifles. The AR-15 is the bestselling long gun in the United States. There are over three million of them that have been purchased by people.\n\nMost people that have them use them for sport shooting, for hunting and for the like. And to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, the mother of one of the victims in Aurora, Colo., was visiting Newtown just yesterday, and she specifically talked about the AR-15, these assault weapons.\n\nAnd she said, they don't belong in the hands of people in the community. What do you say to what -- her name is...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... Phillips.\n\nDAVID KEENE: It was interesting, Judy, because...\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do you say to her?\n\nDAVID KEENE: ... because we're talking -- anybody who dies in a tragedy, whether it's an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun, it is tragic. And I can understand her reaction to that.\n\nBut, in this country, last year, more people were, in fact, beaten to death than killed by all long arms, including assault, so-called assault weapons. The semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806.\n\nIn our museum, we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine, a magazine that would be banned by some people, that Lewis and Clark took with them on their expedition.\n\nIt's been that long. And we're talking -- we're talking about something that has no impact. We have tried to do that as a society before. It hasn't made any difference.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we can argue about the statistics. I mean, what is out there...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Right. People do that.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: ... 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due -- had a gun involved.\n\nBut, specifically, David Keene, what about what we're hearing from the president, that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon, that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks? Is there -- where -- is there any common ground between the position of the NRA and the White House?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Yes, there is some common ground.\n\nIt's not on banning rifles that we don't think would make any difference. And it's not on setting up a national gun registry.\n\nBut we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms.\n\nWhen you go into a store to buy a gun, or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they have to check your background. The FBI keep databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns, felons and the like. We have been urging that these people be put on these lists. And nothing has happened.\n\nTwenty-three states don't put any on the list. Now, one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that partly in that way. The problem is, you can never predict in a society who is going to do what.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Right.\n\nDAVID KEENE: So, you also have to provide security. And that's what we have been proposing in terms of the schools.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that's why -- and that's -- and you mentioned mental illness. And that is something the administration is going to talk about.\n\nMaybe there's some common ground there. When it comes to guards, putting armed guards, Gov. Markell said earlier on the program that -- he said, how would you know where to put a guard, how many to put? He said it's really an impractical thing to...\n\nDAVID KEENE: Sure.\n\nWell, I don't think that it's impractical. You know, just by coincidence, I was in Israel the day after the Newtown shooting. And I was touring a facility where they in fact train guards for their schools, because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s.\n\nTheir crazy people are a little different from ours, but the results were the same. And they first used volunteers.\n\nNow each school provides its own through private security guards. And I was a place where they train these people. It works there. It was a sensible thing for them to do.\n\nAfter Columbine, President Clinton proposed what he called the COPS program. And about 28,000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards. Those schools have them.\n\nNow, and it is -- there's an argument -- the argument against it is just what you said. But the fact is, if you look at the people who do this, first of all, they're mentally deranged. And, secondly, they're cowards. And the fact that there's somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything.\n\nCan you -- do we live in a perfect world? No. But we can do what makes sense to protect our kids.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of what's not perfect, what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying they're not trying to attack the Second Amendment are saying? They simply want to make -- they want to reduce gun violence.\n\nWhy not try reducing high-capacity ammunition clips? Why not try a ban on assault weapons?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, we tried a ban on assault weapons. The only thing that is different is -- and, remember, Judy, that an assault weapon has to be listed because there's no functional difference between a so-called assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle.\n\nSo, this time, they're saying, well, if it has a pistol grip, it's dangerous. If it doesn't have a pistol grip, it isn't dangerous. Now, that's absurd from a functional standpoint, because it's the same gun, the same rifle. And the only difference is cosmetic.\n\nSo, banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause -- is not going to cure the problem.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not saying there's -- couldn't reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you, your organization and would satisfy those who say, we have got to make it safer?\n\nDAVID KEENE: That's why we went to the meeting with Vice President Biden.\n\nBut, you know, before that meeting, the vice president himself and those speaking for him said, we're open-minded. We're going to discuss this. We got to the meeting.\n\nAnd one of the first things he said was, the president and I have strong feelings about firearms, and nobody is going to change our mind on that. We're going to pursue what we want to pursue.\n\nFine. They had the meeting, so they could say, oh, and we talked to the NRA.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I happened to talk to someone in the White House, because I had heard you say something similar to that in another interview. And they say that's not what was said in the meeting.\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, it is.\n\nAnd the other thing -- let me say one other thing. In the last year, 77,000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms. That, in itself, is a crime. You know how many have been prosecuted? Seventy.\n\nWhen that was raised at the meeting, the attorney general said, well, we don't have the resources and the time to be going after those people. Those people are the potential criminals whom we're trying to keep guns out of the hands of, but the government doesn't have time to do anything about them. They do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, David Keene, the new polls show that are out that show even in gun-owning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about, again, high-capacity ammunition clips, assault weapons, background checks?\n\nDAVID KEENE: Well, actually, interestingly, the Gallup poll showed no change at all on the so-called assault weapon question. I consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians.\n\nBut, given the publicity and everything, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more of an immediate reaction.\n\nBut when we get into this, when we begin to discuss it -- and remember it's sort of deja vu, because we have had this discussion before. Once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it, I'm confident that the judgment of the American people is going to be as it was before.\n\nAnd that is that Second Amendment rights should be protected. Criminals should be prosecuted. And we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: David Keene, president of the NRA, we thank you for being with us tonight.\n\nDAVID KEENE: My pleasure, as always. Thank you."}

DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15\u201330 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you\u2019ve ever really known.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who\u2019ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.\n\nI\u2019m sure this election has been stressful for you.\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation\u2019s problems. That\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not kind, and it\u2019s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.\n\nMany of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You\u2019ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn\u2019t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.\n\nI want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential \u2014 that\u2019s what makes our country great, and that\u2019s the promise I\u2019m going to fight to fulfill.\n\nSo here\u2019s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you\u2019ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country \u2014 and that\u2019s what DACA can provide.\n\nBut I know that\u2019s not enough \u2014 we have to do more for you and your families. That\u2019s why as president, I\u2019m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\n\nWhile we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court\u2019s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president\u2019s authority and won\u2019t stop fighting until we see it through.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it\u2019s helped so far \u2014 and let\u2019s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.\n\nWe have always been a nation of immigrants \u2014 those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won\u2019t forget it, and I won\u2019t forget you.\n\nThank you \u2014 and keep being brave,\n\nHillary"}

He also directs the center\u2019s Washington, D.C., office.\n\nIf Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama\u2019s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.\n\nBut one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)\n\nRetirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it\u2019s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.\n\nOver the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.\n\nThe importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party\u2019s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.\n\nIn 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party\u2019s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.\n\nRepublicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics\u2019 Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.\n\nBut in all likelihood, the foundation for this year\u2019s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That\u2019s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.\n\nAn election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the purposes of this \u201cwhat if\u201d exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:\n\nWest Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito\u2019s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito\u2019s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle \u2013 she\u2019s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn\u2019t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive \u2013 but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we\u2019d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.\n\nMontana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh\u2019s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite."}

But, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to be shot.\n\nThe outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\n\nThe images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\n\nGlenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:\n\nSoldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They\u2019re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It\u2019s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:\n\nWhy armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (\u201c\u2018This my property!\u2019 he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.\u201d) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that \u201cWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone\u201d?\n\nOlson added, \u201cthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\u201d\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nMost police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.\n\nThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement.\n\nNot surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.\n\nThis is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\u201d\n\nBernick continued, \u201cfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\u201d\n\nBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \u201ctoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\u201d\n\nWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.\n\nGiven these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\n\nThis is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.\n\nAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\n\nThe militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.\n\nAmericans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.\n\nLet us continue to pray for Michael Brown\u2019s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.\n\nPaul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.\n\nWitness Tension Between Police and Protestors in Ferguson, Mo.

Did they bring down that Russian plane?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?\n\nOBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.\n\nAnd this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.\n\nBut this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it?\n\nOBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit.\n\nWhat makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it means\n\nOBAMA: with respect to ISIL.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: that Vladimir Putin will start to take them on?\n\nOBAMA: Well Putin, I think, from the start has been sincere in seeing ISIL as a threat. The reason he went into Syria is not primarily because of ISIL, but to prop up Assad. And part of our goal is to underscore for him and for everyone in the region that ISIL is the primary threat and you can't solve the ISIL problem if, in fact, you've got a country that is governed by somebody who's illegitimate and that the majority of Syrians reject.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Big meeting this weekend. Can you convince him?\n\nOBAMA: What's interesting is we've already seen I think a growing awareness on the part of the Russians after several weeks now of fairly high paced bombing that they're not going to win this militarily. I think they understand that. They may not admit it publicly, but you're already starting to see indications of that.\n\nAnd it is a modestly positive sign that they've engaged with us, the Saudis the Turks and others to try to broker a political transition plan. Now, they have not yet come to the conclusion that Assad can't be part of a new Syria. And I think it's going to take some time for them to get there. But our goal here, and John Kerry, I think's, done outstanding work in starting to create a platform and a set of principles whereby we agree that a political s solution is what's required, that it has to be inclusive, that there's going to be a transition phase.\n\nAnd, by bringing in the Iranians and the Russians, which is tough for us and tough for a number of our coalition allies they're now at the table. We're starting to shape who are the groups that could responsibly govern Syria. And if we can keep pushing on that diplomatic track even as we're squeezing ISIL in places like the Sinjar operation that's currently taking place then what you see over the course of the next year is I think the possibility that our 60-member coalition and the approach that we're taking is one that Russia determines\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But the coalition hasn't all stepped up. And some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down.\n\nOBAMA: I think what is true is that this has always been a multi-year project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in in sufficient numbers so simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?\n\nOBAMA: Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria it they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain.\n\nWhat we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters. But one of the things that I'll be talking about when I see President Erdogan in Turkey and discuss this with the G20 is that we've still got to do more work in controlling the border so that the influx of foreign fighters is much more reduced.\n\nAnd you know, what we also have to do is frankly work with the Iraqis to strengthen their capabilities. Because one of the big challenges throughout this campaign has been that the Iraqi military has proven itself to be effective in protecting Baghdad. But it's much harder for them, because they're primarily Shia, to move out into Sunni areas. And part of our goal has to be to recruit more effective Sunni partners in Iraq to really go on offense rather than simply engage in defense.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So what do you think when you hear someone like Ben Carson get up in a debate and say, \"Hey, this would be easy. We can take ISIL out just by bombing their oil fields in Anbar,\" that's what a general told him.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. What I think is that he doesn't know much about it. And look George, I think it's fair to say that over the last several years I've had access to all the best military minds in the country and all the best foreign policy minds in the country. And I'm not running for office. And so my only interest is in success.\n\nAnd if I'm down in the Situation Room talking with people who have worked in these regions and have run major military operations from the chairman of my joint chiefs of staff Joe Dunford to, you know, individuals like General Allen, who was involved in Iraqi operations back in 2007/2008, and they don't think it's easy, then it's probably not easy.\n\nAnd what we've been able to do is to shape a strategy that first and foremost contained the momentum that ISIL had gained. We are now in a position where slowly, incrementally we're pushing back against areas where we know we've got some solid partners like the Kurds and the Peshmerga. But until we get the Syria political situation resolved and until Assad is no longer a lightning rod for Sunnis in Syria and the that entire region is not longer a proxy war for Shia/Sunni conflict we're going to continue to have problems\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That could take a generation.\n\nOBAMA: Well I would distinguish between making sure that the place is perfect. That's not going to happen anytime soon with making sure that ISIL continues to shrink in its scope of operations until it no longer poses the kind of threat that it does, not just primarily to us, but to neighbors in the region like Jordan or Saudi Arabia and that the humanitarian crisis that's taking place with millions of people who are fleeing the country that that can be relieved.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You're not running for office. But as you know, the Republican candidates are putting your foreign policy on the ballot. They say the Obama/Clinton legacy is a more dangerous world because you're weak and America has failed to lead. If you were up on that stage, how would you respond?\n\nOBAMA: Well, what I would say is that America is not weaker; it's stronger around the world than when I came into office. And that can be measured by the influence that we have on a whole range of transnational issues, the cooperation that we get on not just counterterrorism, but on critical issues like climate change the work that we're doing in Asia that I'll be traveling to talk about in terms of creating the kinds of rule based systems that preserve our freedom of navigation and try to push back against Chinese efforts that may threaten the peace and prosperity of the region.\n\nYou know, there was a lot of talk among these Republicans about the success of Putin's strategy in the Ukraine. But in fact, because we were able to mobilize the entire international community, we've been able to you know, not only reduce the fighting in Ukraine, but now we're still on track to potentially resolve that peacefully. So you know, one of the things that's striking to me, George, is that pub public opinion around the world about the United States is significantly higher than it was when I came into office.\n\nWe have not seen the kinds of big threats against the United States that sadly we saw during something like 9/11. We've been able to take more than 180,000 troops or 150, 60, 70,000 troops out of harm's way while still maintaining coalition partnerships. And in everywhere from Latin America to Africa we helped to shape the agenda for a more peaceful, prosperous world. So when you hear rhetoric like this, George, about America's never been in greater danger that's rhetoric. That's campaign talk.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But when you think about it, when you reflect on it, where have you fallen short? You didn't expect to have several thousand troops in Afghanistan, more than 3,500 troops in Iraq.\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think actually in Afghanistan let's take Afghanistan as an example. I don't think any of us were ever under any illusion that we could withdraw every single troop out of Afghanistan and that country, which is one of the poorest in the world, that has gone through 30 or 40 year so fighting would be completely stable.\n\nOur very premise, our strategy was always that we were going to have to provide the kinds of advice the kinds of training, the kinds of military support that would be required so that this nascent democracy began to work. And that's exactly what we're doing. I when I consider where we have fallen short, what is absolutely true is that in the Middle East and in Syria in particular the you know, enormous changes that took place post Arab Spring were ones that don't happen, you know, every ten years. They happen every 50, 60, 70 years. And we have not been able to get the kind of success on the ground with countries that were fragile to begin with that were governed by dictators to create the kind of civil society that would allow for a functioning, if not perfectly democratic, then at least civil society and government.\n\nAnd you know, that's humbling. But it's hard. And when you hear the Republicans talk about well, you know, we'd go in and fix this right away. We're going to win in Middle East. What's clear is that you don't have any sense of how difficult it is. And they don't have a lot of sense of history, including the recent history of our efforts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Lot of talk about immigration as well. Donald Trump is speaking about history. He wants to bring back Operation Wetback from President Eisenhower and deportation force. What would that mean?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think the name of the operation tells you something about the dangers of looking backwards. And the notion that we're going to deport 11, 12 million people from this country, first of all I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money's going to come from. It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that. Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children and putting them in what, detention centers and then systematically sending them out. Nobody thinks that that is realistic, but more importantly, that's not who we are as Americans.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think when you hear people cheer for that?\n\nOBAMA: Well, what I think is that there's always been a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in America, ironically from folks who themselves two generations back or even one generation back were immigrants themselves. And it's the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment. Now, those sentiments get stronger when people feel insecure.\n\nAnd given what happened in 2007, 2008, given the fact that despite the recovery, I think people still have some post-traumatic stress and are still concerned about prospects for jobs and economic security in the future it's easy to play on those fears. But that's not that's not what you want from your president.\n\nAnd to their credit Republican and as well as Democratic senators and or presidents in the past, including Ronald Reagan, including George H.W. Bush, including George W. Bush have understood that we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants and that proposing radical and necessarily cruel solutions to a problem that can be solved by some good, old-fashioned legislation of the sort that passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and I would've been able to sign two years ago if the House Republicans had allowed it to come to the floor 'cause there was a majority on that floor to vote for it we don't want I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say we're a nation of laws. On the issue of Guantanamo, one of your big promises, closing Guantanamo Speaker Ryan says you can't close it on your own, don't have the authority. He says the law is the law. Do you have the authority to close it on your own?\n\nOBAMA: Well, here's what I know is that we need to close it. That's not just my opinion. If you take a survey of retired generals folks who are currently in uniform they will tell you that this is a consistent recruitment tool for jihadists. It is contrary to our values. It costs huge amounts of money. And it's not sustainable\n\nOBAMA: so it is my--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: did on your own.\n\nOBAMA: So it is my job to, first and foremost, work with Congress to try to find a solution. And what we've been able to do during the course of this administration is to systematically transfer and draw down the numbers who are there. My hope is that by the end of this year we are seeing close to under 100 prisoners remaining and detainees remaining. And then my intention is to present to Congress a sensible, plausible plan that will meet our national security needs and be consistent with who are\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And when they say no?\n\nOBAMA: Well they I'm not going to one of the things that I've been consistently trying to do is to give Congress the chance to do the right thing before I then look at my next options. And Congress is going to have an opportunity, I think when they look at the numbers, when they look at how much it costs for us to detain these individuals, when they hear from both current and retired military officers who say this is not what we should be doing they're going to have the ability to make their own assumptions.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you're not ruling out doing it on your own?\n\nOBAMA: My job right now is to make sure that Congress has a chance to look at a serious plan and look at all the facts and we'll take it from there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Will you rule out executive action?\n\nOBAMA: We'll take it from there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You've called Hillary Clinton a good friend, strong friend, one of America's finest secretaries of state and said she'd make a great president. So is it fair for Democrats to conclude she's your candidate?\n\nOBAMA: (LAUGH) George, I'm not going to make endorsements when, you know, I've said in the past it's important for the process to play itself out. I think Dem I think Hillary's doing great. I think, you know, Bernie Sanders is really adding to this debate--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Would he make a great president?\n\nOBAMA: -- in a very serious way. You know, I think Bernie is capturing a sense among the American people that they want to know the government's on their side, that it's not bought and paid for, that you know, our focus has to be on hard working, middle class Americans not getting' a raw deal. And I think that is in in incredibly important. I think Martin O'Malley has important things to say. So we'll let this process play out. I am confident that we're going to have a good, strong Democratic candidate, and that they'll be able to win in November.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally-- when you were a student, you spoke out, you protested apartheid in South Africa. If you were on the campus of University of Missouri today, would you be a protestor?\n\nOBAMA: (SIGH) Without knowing all the facts I've read enough to know that there is clearly a problem at-- the University of Missouri. And, that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest-- what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. I want-- an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry. And-- the issue is just making sure that-- even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out-- that they're also listening. And, you know I'd rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive. I think that what you saw with the University of Missouri football team, and the coach, you know, standing up for something that they think is right-- harkens back to a powerful tradition that helped to bring about great change in this country. But I also want to make sure that they understand that being a good citizen being an activist involves hearing the other side--\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: See, that's what I wanted to ask you (CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: --and making sure that you are engaging in a dialogue, because that's also how change happens. The civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience, because people were willing to get to go to jail, because there were events like Bloody Sunday. But it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views even views that were appalling to them of the other side.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Because there does seem to be a strain on some of these campuses of a kind of militant political correctness where you shut down the other side.\n\nOBAMA: And I disagree with that. And, it's interesting. You know, I've now got, you know, daughters who-- one is about to go to college-- the other one's-- you know, going to be on her way in a few years. And then we talk about this at the dinner table.\n\nAnd I say to them, \"Listen, if you hear somebody using a racial epithet, if you hear somebody who's anti-Semitic, if you see an injustice, I want you to speak out. And I want you to be firm and clear and I want you to protect people who may not have voices themselves. I want you to be somebody who's strong and sees themselves as somebody who's looking out for the vulnerable.\"\n\nBut I tell 'em-- \"I want you also to be able to listen. I don't want you to think that a display of your strength is simply shutting other people up. And that part of your ability to bring about change is going to be by engagement and understanding the viewpoints and the arguments of the other side.\" And so when I hear, for example, you know, folks on college campuses saying, \"We're not going to allow somebody to speak on our campus because we disagree with their ideas or we feel threatened by their ideas--\" you know, I think that's a recipe for dogmatism. And I think you're not going to be as effective. And so, but I want to be clear here 'cause, and it's a tough issue because, you know, there are two values that I care about.\n\nI care about civil rights and I care about kids not being discriminated against or having swastikas painted on their doors or nooses hung-- thinking it's a joke. I think it's entirely appropriate for-- any institution, including universities, to say, \"Don't walk around in black face. It offends people. Don't wear a headdress and beat your chest if Native American students have said, you know, 'This hurts us. This bothers us.\" There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut we also have these values of free speech. And it's not free speech in the abstract. The purpose of that kind of free speech is to make sure that we are forced to use argument and reason and words in making our democracy work. And you know, the you don't have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas. Just out-argue 'em, beat 'em.\n\nMake the case as to why they're wrong. Win over adherents. That's how-- that's how things work in-- in-- in a democracy. And I do worry if young people start getting trained to think that if somebody says something I don't like if somebody says something that hurts my feelings that my only recourse is to shut them up, avoid them, push them away, call on a higher power to protect me from that. You know, and yes, does that put more of a burden on minority students or gay students or Jewish students or others in a majority that may be blind to history and blind to their hurt? It may put a slightly higher burden on them.\n\nBut you're not going to make the kinds of deep changes in society-- that those students want, without taking it on, in a full and clear and courageous way. And you know, I tell you I trust Malia in an argument. If a knucklehead on a college campus starts talking about her, I guarantee you she will give as good as she gets.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you've been having some good dinner table conversations.

Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.\n\nNumerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\n\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\nSec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).\n\n(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.\n\n(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.\n\n(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.\n\n(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant\u2019s likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant\u2019s ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\nSec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\n\n(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.\n\n(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\n(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest \u2014 including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship \u2014 and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.\n\n(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.\n\n(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\n\nSec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.\n\nSec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n\n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\n\nSec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.\n\n(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\n\nSec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.\n\nSec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:\n\n(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;\n\n(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and\n\n(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\n\n(b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.\n\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nDONALD J.

More recently, she became known in Alaska as a popular maverick, staunchly conservative on key issues but vocal about problems she saw, including those in her own party. Watch how conservatives say they're thrilled with Palin \u00bb\n\nShe got the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her fierce competitiveness on the basketball court in high school. Some of her opponents revived the name after she became mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, in 1996, kicking out a three-term incumbent and butting heads with some city department heads who remained loyal to her predecessor, according to the Almanac of American Politics.\n\nSarah Palin Born: February 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho Education: B.S., University of Idaho, 1987 Elected offices: Wasilla, Alaska, City Council member, 1992-96\n\nWasilla mayor, 1996-2002\n\nElected governor of Alaska, 2006 Professional career: Television sports reporter, 1987-89; co-owner, commercial fishing operation, 1988-2007; owner, snow machine, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business, 1994-97; chairwoman, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2003-04. Married: To Todd Palin; five children. The oldest, Track, serves in the U.S. Army; the youngest, Trig, has Down syndrome. Sources: Almanac of American Politics, CNN\n\n\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, she chaired the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates Alaska's oil and gas resources.\n\nWidely seen as a political outsider who stayed at arm's length from her party establishment, she defeated two political insiders in 2006 to become the youngest, and first female, governor in the state's history.\n\nAs governor, she won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul.\n\nBut her term was not without controversy. A legislative investigation is looking into allegations that Palin fired Alaska's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, a state trooper. She denied wrongdoing.\n\nAn outspoken anti-abortion Republican, Palin has spoken out about her fifth child, who was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome.\n\n\"We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives,\" the Republican National Committee quoted her as saying. \"We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\"\n\nShe is married to her high-school sweetheart, a commercial fisherman. The two eloped in 1988, to save money on a big wedding, a year after she graduated from the University of Idaho, where she studied journalism and political science, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Watch details on elopement \u00bb\n\nPalin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.\n\nAs millions of Americans began searching for information on her Friday, her official Web site as governor wasn't the only one getting flooded with traffic. Traffic also spiked at sites showcasing pictures from 1984, when she wore the crown of Miss Wasilla and competed in the Miss Alaska contest.\n\nShe was born in Idaho, and her parents moved to Alaska when she was 3 months old.\n\nSome similarities between Palin and McCain were clear Friday: Both have been termed mavericks, and both have taken on the GOP establishment at times. McCain has a son who has served in Iraq; Palin has one heading there soon. So does her vice presidential opponent, Sen. Joe Biden.\n\nFor all that is known about her, Palin now becomes the most prominent unknown quantity in the presidential race. Her lack of experience on national political issues, including foreign policy and homeland security, and her only brief experience as governor open clear lines of attack for the Obama campaign. Watch Democrats respond to the Palin pick \u00bb\n\nThen again, McCain's surprising announcement Friday and the intense focus it drew threatened to slow Obama's post-convention momentum in a dramatic way.\n\nNo stranger to being a first in Alaska, Palin now faces being a first on a national level: the first female No. 2 on the GOP presidential ticket and only the second female on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro more than 20 years ago.\n\nSchumer described McCain's choice as a \"Hail Mary pass.\" Whether that's true has yet to be seen.\n\nBut what's not in question is that in entering the race, Sarah Palin changes the game.\n\nAll About Sarah Palin \u2022 Alaska \u2022 John McCain"}

Rick Perry\u2019s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation\u2019s 40th president.\n\n\"You\u2019re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?\" Hannity asked.\n\nPerry replied that he\u2019d had a conversation with Reagan\u2019s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. \"I told Michael Reagan the other day \u2026 \u2018You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,\u2019 but I said, \u2018I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.\u2019 \"\n\nPerry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that \"Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.\"\n\nHistorian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan\u2019s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, \"was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.\"\n\nYager said that he hadn\u2019t seen copies of Reagan\u2019s voter registration cards but that \"virtually all the sources that refer to\" Reagan\u2019s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan \"has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times\" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.\n\nLater, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan\u2019s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 \u2014 at ages 41 and 45, respectively \u2014 and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 \"while remaining a Democrat.\"\n\nPerry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.\n\nThe library\u2019s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon\u2019s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. \"When he said, \u2018Well, no, I haven\u2019t yet, but I intend to,\u2019 down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, \u2018I\u2019m a registrar,\u2019 and placed a registration card in front of him,\" the site says. \"In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.\"\n\nIn her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: \"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''\n\nOther studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager\u2019s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan \"was an active Democrat\" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, \"and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.\"\n\nIn 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he \"didn\u2019t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans\" and would re-register as a Republican. \"He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,\" Cannon writes.\n\nSo, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.\n\nHow old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at Perry\u2019s political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 \u2014 a race that Perry won in an upset.\n\nThe biography on Perry\u2019s presidential campaign website agrees with that account.\n\nA July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. \"Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,\" the story says. \"He was one of a handful of freshman \u2018pit bulls,\u2019 so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.\"\n\nThe Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. \"I intend to vote the same convictions,\" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. \"The only difference is there will be an \u2018R\u2019 beside my name.\"\n\nOn the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.\n\nWe rate his statement as True."}

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States. We are giving every member of Congress an opportunity to stand with the American people by affirming their opposition to bringing these terrorists into our communities, and we hope they join us. Equally as important, this bill holds the Administration accountable if it acts unilaterally against the will of the American people.\n\n\u201cThe world did not suddenly become safe in January 2009. There are still terrorists around the world who are committed to killing Americans and destroying our way of life. A number of those terrorists are being held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay right now. If the Administration is allowed to proceed, they won\u2019t be there for long. In fact, they may be right here, in the United States. I have been urging the Administration to finally present to the American people its plan for what to do with the terrorists held at Guantanamo and for confronting and defeating the global terrorist threat. Right now, that plan does not exist, and the safety of our nation depends on it.\n\n\u201cOur ranking members John McHugh, Pete Hoekstra, Lamar Smith, Peter King, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen all deserve great credit for their work on this measure. I thank them for their efforts in crafting this critically important bill.\u201d\n\nNOTE: Following is a summary of the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act:\n\nAffirming Congress\u2019 Opposition to the Release and Transfer of Terrorists. The bill affirms Congress\u2019 opposition to transferring or releasing terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. Most Americans do not support releasing these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay prison and transferring them into the United States. The bill gives Congress an opportunity to show that it stands with the American people on this critical matter, and opposes the release and transfer of these terrorists.\n\nGovernor & State Legislature Pre-Approval. The measure prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without express approval from the state\u2019s governor and legislature, and certifies to Congress that strict requirements have been met. For example, the Administration must certify to the respective governor and state legislature that the detainee does not pose a security risk to the United States. The certifications must be made 60 days before any transfer or release.\n\nPresidential Certification Requirements. The measure prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides the following notification and certification to Congress regarding:\n\n\n\n- The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States.\n\n\n\n- The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee.\n\n\n\n- The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee.\n\n\n\n- The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States.\n\n#####"}

Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta\u2019s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump\u2019s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump\u2019s Sunday night\u2019s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans\u2019 freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. \u201cThese words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies\u2019 advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. \u201cDonald Trump needs to humble himself,\u201d Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump\u2019s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: \u201cHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America\u2019s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department\u2019s release of more of Clinton\u2019s own emails from her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump\u2019s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s candidacy appeared\u2014yet again\u2014to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta\u2019s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton\u2019s emails, which he called an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump\u2019s words, however. \u201cWomen have the power to stop Trump,\u201d Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events\u2014and the responses\u2014would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe is talking about sexual assault. There\u2019s no other way to frame this,\u201d Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide\u2019s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches\u2014a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton\u2019s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa\u2019s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? \u201cClinton admits she is out of touch,\u201d \u201cClinton suggests she is a moderate\u201d and \u201cClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: \u201cClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.\u201d Republicans are obsessed with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump\u2019s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump\u2019s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call \u201clocker-room banter\u201d laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women\u2019s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that \u201csuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump \u201ca malignant clown.\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks\u201dtotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said \u201cAmerica deserves far better\u201d than Trump. Trump\u2019s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said \u201cno apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump\u2019s video. \u201cThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,\u201d former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. \u201cShe has to change the narrative.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump\u2019s supporters firmly in their camp. \u201cA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump\u2019s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night\u2019s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com."}

He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.\n\nIn a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.\n\n\u201cSpecial interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cHe\u2019s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth\u2019s airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough\u2014our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nGrimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left\u2019s apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court\u2019s dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,\u201d says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. \u201cShe understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.\u201d\n\nThe Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \u201cstop special interest billionaires,\u201d that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nIn the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.\n\nAccording to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year\u2019s races.\n\nDemocrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky\u2019s Senate race.\n\nMcConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he\u2019s raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell\u2019s approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.\n\nFormer FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven\u2019t always worked out for candidates.\n\n\u201cOne reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it\u2019s not that effective in directly advancing a candidate\u2019s interest,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let\u2019s say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We\u2019ve seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.\u201d\n\nGrimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell\u2019s money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.\n\nThe McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.\n\n\u201cLike Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,\u201d McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. \u201cThe sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\u201d\n\nThe top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.\n\nAsked about Grimes\u2019 wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.\n\n\u201cThe real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.\u201d"}

This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThis one\u2019s on foreign policy. I\u2019m Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides.\n\nSCHIEFFER: The audience has taken a vow of silence \u2014 no applause, no reaction of any kind, except right now when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple. They\u2019ve asked me to divide the evening into segments. I\u2019ll pose a question at the beginning of each segment. You will each have two minutes to respond and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment.\n\nTonight\u2019s debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest we\u2019ve ever come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad.\n\nSo let\u2019s begin.\n\nSCHIEFFER: The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism. I\u2019m going to put this into two segments so you\u2019ll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject. The first question, and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues. Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador. Questions remain. What happened? What caused it? Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?\n\nGovernor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.\n\nSCHIEFFER: I\u2019d like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that.\n\nGovernor Romney, you won the toss. You go first.\n\nROMNEY: Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And Mr. President, it\u2019s good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it\u2019s nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. We\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nThis is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a \u2014 a complete change in the \u2014 the structure and the \u2014 the environment in the Middle East.\n\nWith the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, we\u2019ve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in \u2014 in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against \u2014 against our people there, four people dead.\n\nOur hearts and \u2014 and minds go out to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. We have in \u2014 in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what we\u2019re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And \u2014 and we\u2019re going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on \u2014 on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.\n\nBut we can\u2019t kill our way out of this mess. We\u2019re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the \u2014 the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is \u2014 it\u2019s certainly not on the run.\n\nROMNEY: It\u2019s certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nOBAMA: Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the last four years.\n\nWe ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership has been decimated.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm\u2019s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them.\n\nOBAMA: Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, I\u2019m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.\n\nROMNEY: Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to \u2014 to kill them, to take them out of the picture.\n\nBut my strategy is broader than that. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s important, of course. But the key that we\u2019re going to have to pursue is a \u2014 is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.\n\nWe don\u2019t want another Iraq, we don\u2019t want another Afghanistan. That\u2019s not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the \u2014 the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these \u2014 these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.\n\nAnd how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the \u2014 the world reject these \u2014 these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this:\n\nOne, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we \u2014 we push back and give them more economic development.\n\nNumber two, better education.\n\nNumber three, gender equality.\n\nNumber four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies.\n\nBut what\u2019s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we\u2019ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And \u2014 and they\u2019re throughout many nations in the Middle East.\n\nROMNEY: It\u2019s wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.\n\nBut next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libya\u2019s 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want \u2014 we want to make sure that we\u2019re seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to \u2014 to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.\n\nAnd, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we\u2019ve got real (inaudible).\n\nSCHIEFFER: We\u2019ll get to that, but let\u2019s give the president a chance.\n\nOBAMA: Governor Romney, I\u2019m glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what\u2019s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they\u2019re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\n\nBut Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.\n\nYou say that you\u2019re not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the \u2014 the challenge we have \u2014 I know you haven\u2019t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy \u2014 but every time you\u2019ve offered an opinion, you\u2019ve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.\n\nYou said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldn\u2019t be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.\n\nOBAMA: So, what \u2014 what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, that\u2019s the kind of opinions that you\u2019ve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.\n\nSCHIEFFER: I\u2019m going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.\n\nROMNEY: Well, of course I don\u2019t concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I\u2019ve said. They don\u2019t happen to be accurate. But \u2014 but I can say this, that we\u2019re talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we\u2019re seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and \u2014 and confusion. And \u2014 and attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how we\u2019re going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.\n\nBut I\u2019ll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe. Not\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: Excuse me. It\u2019s a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same \u2014 in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. I\u2019m not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And I\u2019m certainly not going to say to him, I\u2019ll give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, he\u2019ll get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: Oh you didn\u2019t? You didn\u2019t want a status of\u2026\n\nOBAMA: What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down. And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.\n\nROMNEY: I\u2019m sorry, you actually \u2014 there was a \u2014 there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. That was something I concurred with\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026that your posture. That was my posture as well. You thought it should have been 5,000 troops\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: \u2026 I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what? The answer was we got\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026 no troops through whatsoever.\n\nOBAMA: This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.\n\nROMNEY: No, I\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s a\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: You \u2014 you\u2026\n\nROMNEY: \u2026that\u2019s a \u2014 I indicated\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: \u2026major speech.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026I indicated that you failed to put in place a status\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.\n\nOBAMA: Governor \u2014 here \u2014 here\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s one thing\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: \u2026here\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned as commander in chief.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let him answer\u2026\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.\n\nNow, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. And so what I\u2019ve done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.\n\nNumber two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel\u2019s security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.\n\nNumber three, we do have to make sure that we\u2019re protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can\u2019t develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.\n\nNumber four, we do have to develop their economic \u2014 their economic capabilities.\n\nBut number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can\u2019t continue to do nation building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that we\u2019re doing nation building here at home. That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned \u2014 alluded to this, and that is Syria.\n\nThe war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. We have, what, more than 100 people that were killed there in a bomb. There were demonstrations there, eight people dead.\n\nMr. President, it\u2019s been more than a year since you saw \u2014 you told Assad he had to go. Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died. We\u2019ve had 300,000 refugees.\n\nThe war goes on. He\u2019s still there. Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there? Or is that even possible?\n\nAnd you go first, sir.\n\nOBAMA: What we\u2019ve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go. We\u2019ve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we\u2019re particularly interested in making sure that we\u2019re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.\n\nBut ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.\n\nThis \u2014 what we\u2019re seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that\u2019s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we\u2019re not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.\n\nAnd I am confident that Assad\u2019s days are numbered. But what we can\u2019t do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term. SCHIEFFER: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: Well, let\u2019s step back and talk about what\u2019s happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.\n\nROMNEY: Syria is Iran\u2019s only ally in the Arab world. It\u2019s their route to the sea. It\u2019s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a \u2014 a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we don\u2019t want to have military involvement there. We don\u2019t want to get drawn into a military conflict.\n\nAnd so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a \u2014 in a form of \u2014 if not government, a form of \u2014 of \u2014 of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they don\u2019t have arms that get into the \u2014 the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with \u2014 with Israel.\n\nBut the Saudi\u2019s and the Qatari, and \u2014 and the Turks are all very concerned about this. They\u2019re willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the \u2014 the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize \u2014 I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe \u2014 we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a \u2014 as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.\n\nThis \u2014 this is a critical opportunity for America. And what I\u2019m afraid of is we\u2019ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we\u2019ll let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad \u2014 excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we\u2019re going to try to have a ceasefire. That didn\u2019t work. Then it went to the Russians and said, let\u2019s see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nROMNEY: \u2026by the leadership role.\n\nOBAMA: We are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya \u2014 because this is an example of how we make choices. When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn\u2019t stay there.\n\nAnd to the governor\u2019s credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.\n\nImagine if we had pulled out at that point. You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. That\u2019s part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.\n\nBut we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do, like for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?\n\nROMNEY: I don\u2019t want to have our military involved in Syria. I don\u2019t think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I don\u2019t anticipate that in the future.\n\nAs I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove \u2014 to remove Assad.\n\nBut I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our \u2014 of our troops.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Well \u2013\n\nROMNEY: And this isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t going to be necessary.\n\nWe \u2014 we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. But look, this has been going on for a year. This is a time \u2014 this should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.\n\nAs you hear from intelligence sources even today, the \u2014 the insurgents are highly disparate. They haven\u2019t come together. They haven\u2019t formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Can we get a quick response, Mr. President, because I want to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Well, I\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn\u2019t have different ideas. And that\u2019s because we\u2019re doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a \u2014 an effective transition so that we get Assad out. That\u2019s the kind of leadership we\u2019ve shown. That\u2019s the kind of leadership we\u2019ll continue to show.\n\nSCHIEFFER: May I ask you, you know, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go.\n\nOBAMA: Right.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. Do you have any regrets about that?\n\nOBAMA: No, I don\u2019t, because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they\u2019re doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries can\u2019t develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.\n\nThey have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel\u2019s security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.\n\nThey have to make sure that they\u2019re cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.\n\nAnd we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what\u2019s going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.\n\nTheir aspirations are similar to young people\u2019s here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.\n\nAnd so one of the things that we\u2019ve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that\u2019s noncorrupt, that\u2019s transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to do here at home as well.\n\nYou know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we\u2019ve done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we\u2019ve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And it\u2019s very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we\u2019re not doing what we need to do\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?\n\nROMNEY: No. I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his \u2014 his action there. I felt that \u2014 I wish we\u2019d have had a better vision of the future.\n\nI wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president\u2019s term and even further back than that, that we\u2019d have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn\u2019t explode in the way that it did.\n\nBut once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.\n\nLet me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more \u2014 is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they\u2019re going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. That\u2019s our purpose.\n\nAnd the mantle of leadership for the \u2014 promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn\u2019t ask for it. But it\u2019s an honor that we have it.\n\nBut for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the \u2014 when the president of Iraq \u2014 excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that\u2019s a frightening thing.\n\nFormer chief of the \u2014 Joint Chiefs of Staff said that \u2014 Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This \u2014 we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy.\n\nWe need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. We\u2019re blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America\u2019s strength. We\u2019re the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.\n\nROMNEY: And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if we\u2019re strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence will grow. But unfortunately, in \u2014 nowhere in the world is America\u2019s influence greater today than it was four years ago.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nROMNEY: And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve become weaker in each of those four\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: \u2026you\u2019re going to get a chance to respond to that, because that\u2019s a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is America\u2019s role in the world? And that is the question. What do each of you see as our role in the world, and I believe, Governor Romney, it\u2019s your chance to go first.\n\nROMNEY: Well I \u2014 I absolutely believe that America has a \u2014 a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that \u2014 that make the world more peaceful. And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They don\u2019t vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.\n\nWe want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You can\u2019t have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You can\u2019t have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You can\u2019t have kids coming out of college, half of them can\u2019t find a job today, or a job that\u2019s commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going.\n\nAnd our military, we\u2019ve got to strengthen our military long-term. We don\u2019t know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We \u2014 we make decisions today in the military that \u2014 that will confront challenges we can\u2019t imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I \u2014 I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.\n\nI think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.\n\nAnd then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when \u2014 when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nOBAMA: America remains the one indispensable nation. And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.\n\nBecause we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.\n\nIt also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.\n\nAnd Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.\n\nBut what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that\u2019s what my plan does. Making sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we\u2019re creating jobs here, as we\u2019ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nMaking sure that we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nDoing everything we can to control our own energy. We\u2019ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we\u2019ve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we need to show.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t do it. We\u2019ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don\u2019t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology that\u2019s always kept us at the cutting edge.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. He\u2019s praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who\u2019s \u2014 who shows great wisdom and judgment. And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor Romney, \u201cwrong and reckless\u201d policies?\n\nROMNEY: I\u2019ve got a policy for the future and agenda for the future. And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last four years is something I don\u2019t want to see over the next four years.\n\nThe president said by now we\u2019d be a 5.4 percent unemployment. We\u2019re 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I\u2019ll do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. We\u2019re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.\n\nNumber two, we\u2019re going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every \u2014 every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We\u2019re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2014 time zone, language opportunities.\n\nNumber three, we\u2019re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers\u2019 unions going to have to go behind.\n\nAnd then we\u2019re going to have to get to a balanced budget. We can\u2019t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company\u2019s money and invest in America if they think we\u2019re headed to the road to Greece. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget.\n\nAnd finally, number five, we\u2019ve got to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.\n\nOBAMA: Well, let\u2019s talk about what we need to compete. First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don\u2019t help small businesses.\n\nAnd the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. That\u2019s not the kind of small business promotion we need. But let\u2019s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that\u2019s our education policy. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.\n\nYou know, under my leadership, what we\u2019ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. We\u2019ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And they\u2019re starting to finally make progress.\n\nAnd what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we\u2019ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference.\n\nNow, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn\u2019t going to help the economy grow.\n\nOBAMA: When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don\u2019t make a difference.\n\nBut I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if we\u2019ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we\u2019ve got the most highly skilled workforce.\n\nAnd the kinds of budget proposals that you\u2019ve put forward, when we don\u2019t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that\u2019s undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for America\u2019s position in the world, and the world notices.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let me get back to foreign policy.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: Can I just get back\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Well \u2014 well, I need to speak a moment\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: OK.\n\nROMNEY: \u2026 if you\u2019ll let me, Bob, just about education\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: OK.\n\nROMNEY: \u2026 because I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.\n\nWe have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing. Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math. While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math. And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math. First time one state had been number one in all four measures.\n\nHow did we do that? Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.\n\nOBAMA: Ten years earlier\u2026\n\nROMNEY: And that was \u2014 that was \u2014 that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.\n\nOBAMA: But that was 10 years before you took office.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: And then you cut education spending when you came into office.\n\nROMNEY: The first \u2014 the first \u2014 the first \u2014 and we kept our schools number one in the nation. They\u2019re still number one today.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nROMNEY: And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to \u2014 to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.\n\nOBAMA: That happened before you came into office.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President. You got that fact wrong.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let me get \u2014 I want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates.\n\nGovernor, you say you want a bigger military. You want a bigger Navy. You don\u2019t want to cut defense spending. What I want to ask you \u2014 we were talking about financial problems in this country. Where are you going to get the money?\n\nROMNEY: Well, let\u2019s come back and talk about the military, but all the way \u2014 all the way through. First of all, I\u2019m going through from the very beginning \u2014 we\u2019re going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. That\u2019s number one.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But can you do this without driving deeper\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEHY: The good news is (inaudible). I\u2019d be happy to have you take a look. Come on our website. You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years. We do it by getting \u2014 by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.\n\nThere are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can\u2019t afford them. And that one doesn\u2019t sound good and it\u2019s not affordable. So I\u2019d get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we don\u2019t absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.\n\nNumber two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we\u2019ll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.\n\nAs a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these \u2014 these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. I want to do those two things and get this \u2014 get this to a balanced budget with eight \u2014 eight to 10 years.\n\nBut the military \u2014 let\u2019s get back to the military, though.\n\n(CROSSTALK) SCHIEFFER: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: He should have answered the first question.\n\nOBAMA: Look, Governor Romney\u2019s called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he\u2019s going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesn\u2019t work, but he continues to claim that he\u2019s going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.\n\nNow, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I\u2019ve been in office. We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it. The next 10. And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?\n\nAnd that\u2019s the budget that we\u2019ve put forward. But, what you can\u2019t do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that you\u2019re going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are. And then somehow you\u2019re also going to deal with the deficit that we\u2019ve already got. The math simply doesn\u2019t work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we\u2019ve got to think about capabilities.\n\nWe need to be thinking about cyber security. We need to be talking about space. That\u2019s exactly what our budget does, but it\u2019s driven by strategy. It\u2019s not driven by politics. It\u2019s not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see. It\u2019s driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe? That\u2019s exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern. Because we\u2019ve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.\n\nROMNEY: I\u2019m pleased that I\u2019ve balanced budgets. I was on the world of business for 25 years. If you didn\u2019t balance your budget, you went out of business. I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there. I had the chance to be governor of a state. Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget. The president hasn\u2019t balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nROMNEY: I\u2019m going to be able to balance the budget.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about military spending, and that\u2019s this.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: Thirty seconds.\n\nROMNEY: Our Navy is old \u2014 excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We\u2019re now at under 285. We\u2019re headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. That\u2019s unacceptable to me.\n\nI want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed for the first time since FDR \u2014 since FDR we had the \u2014 we\u2019ve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now we\u2019re changing to one conflict. Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.\n\nAnd I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making \u2014 is making our future less certain and less secure.\n\nOBAMA: Bob, I just need to comment on this.\n\nFirst of all, the sequester is not something that I\u2019ve proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen.\n\nThe budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it.\n\nBut I think Governor Romney maybe hasn\u2019t spent enough time looking at how our military works.\n\nYou mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military\u2019s changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\n\nOBAMA: And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we\u2019re counting slips. It\u2019s what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.\n\nOBAMA: And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you\u2019re putting forward because it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nOBAMA: And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSCHIEFFER: A lot to cover. I\u2019d like \u2014 I\u2019d like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran.\n\nWould either of you \u2014 and you\u2019ll have two minutes \u2014 and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one \u2014 would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan.\n\nAnd if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran? It\u2019s certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that \u2014 we made \u2014 we made that promise to our allies.\n\nMr. President?\n\nOBAMA: First of all, Israel is a true friend. It is our greatest ally in the region. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel. I\u2019ve made that clear throughout my presidency. And\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: So you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re saying we\u2019ve already made that declaration.\n\nOBAMA: I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.\n\nIn fact, this week we\u2019ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as I\u2019m president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office.\n\nOBAMA: We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles.\n\nAnd the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel\u2019s national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.\n\nIran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that\u2019s unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.\n\nSo the work that we\u2019ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we\u2019re not going to take any options off the table.\n\nThe disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he\u2019s often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when I\u2019ve sent young men and women into harm\u2019s way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Two minutes.\n\nROMNEY: Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I\u2019m President of the United States, when I\u2019m President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.\n\nAnd if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there\u2019s no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.\n\nROMNEY: It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. You\u2019re seeing it right now in the economy. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But it\u2019s good that we have them.\n\nNumber two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can\u2019t come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn\u2019t, but I\u2019d say companies that are moving their oil can\u2019t, people who are trading in their oil can\u2019t. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, I\u2019d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. I\u2019d make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.\n\nWe need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a \u2014 a \u2014 a solution to this, which says \u2014 which stops this \u2014 this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only \u2013 only consider if all of the other avenues had been \u2014 had been tried to their full extent.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let me ask both of you, there \u2014 as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States a part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. What is the deal, if there are such talks? What is the deal that you would accept, Mr. President?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper. They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.\n\nThere \u2014 there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we\u2019ll accept is they end their nuclear program. It\u2019s very straightforward. And I\u2019m glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we\u2019re taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you\u2019d do the same things we did, but you\u2019d say them louder and somehow that \u2014 that would make a difference.\n\nAnd it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. It\u2019s meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important \u2014 and this is a testament to how we\u2019ve restored American credibility and strength around the world \u2014 is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if it\u2019s just us that are imposing sanctions \u2014 we\u2019ve had sanctions in place a long time. It\u2019s because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And we\u2019ve got to maintain that pressure.\n\nThere is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, we\u2019re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.\n\nAnd one last thing \u2014 just \u2014 just to make this point. The clock is ticking. We\u2019re not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And I\u2019ve been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.\n\nAnd that clock is ticking. And we\u2019re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we\u2019ve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.\n\nI think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world\u2019s worst actors in his first year, he\u2019d sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.\n\nAnd I think they looked and thought, well, that\u2019s an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness.\n\nThen when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent. I think they noticed that as well.\n\nAnd I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.\n\nAll of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we\u2019re just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.\n\nNow there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. That\u2019s unacceptable for us, and it\u2019s essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.\n\nAnd an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won\u2019t have to take the military action.\n\nOBAMA: Bob, let me just respond.\n\nNothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper that\u2019s been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact checker and every reporter who\u2019s looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.\n\nAnd when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we\u2019ve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.\n\nSo I\u2019ll let the American people decide, judge, who\u2019s going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.\n\nAnd with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.\n\nAnd \u2014 and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we\u2019ve been able to mobilize the world.\n\nWhen I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since \u2014 then in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. That\u2019s in America\u2019s national interest and that will be the case so long as I\u2019m president.\n\nROMNEY: We\u2019re four years closer to a nuclear Iran. We\u2019re four years closer to a nuclear Iran. And \u2014 and \u2014 we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they \u2014 they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq. And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.\n\nAnd by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel. And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive. You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.\n\nMr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators.\n\nOBAMA: Bob, let me \u2014 let me respond.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to talk about trips that we\u2019ve taken \u2014 when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn\u2019t take donors. I didn\u2019t attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.\n\nAnd then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children\u2019s bedrooms. And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.\n\nOBAMA: So that\u2019s how I\u2019ve used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region. And the \u2014 the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved? And they can look at my track record, whether it\u2019s Iran sanctions, whether it\u2019s dealing with counterterrorism, whether it\u2019s supporting democracy, whether it\u2019s supporting women\u2019s rights, whether it\u2019s supporting religious minorities.\n\nAnd they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history. And that kind of credibility is precisely why we\u2019ve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.\n\nSCHIEFFER: What if \u2014 what if the prime minister of Israel called you on the phone and said, \u201cOur bombers are on the way. We\u2019re going to bomb Iran.\u201d\n\nWhat do you \u2013\n\nROMNEY: Bob, let\u2019s not go into hypotheticals of that nature. Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way. This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of \u2013\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSCHIEFFER: So you\u2019d say it just wouldn\u2019t happen?\n\nThat\u2019s \u2013\n\nSCHIEFFER: OK. Let\u2019s see what \u2013\n\nROMNEY: But let me \u2014 let me come back \u2014 we can come back. Let\u2019s come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what\u2019s happening in the world and the president\u2019s statement that things are going so well.\n\nLook, I look at what\u2019s happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they\u2019re rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it\u2019s clear they\u2019re there. They\u2019re very strong.\n\nI see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it\u2019s \u2014 growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.\n\nI look around the world and I don\u2019t feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they\u2019re not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more. They\u2019re back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.\n\nROMNEY: I look around the world, I don\u2019t see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the \u2014 the \u2014 the turmoil with Israel.\n\nI mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem. They asked him, please repair the tension \u2014 Democrat senators \u2014 please repair the tension\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nROMNEY: \u2026 the damage in his \u2014 in his own party.\n\nOBAMA: Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it\u2019s the Middle East, whether it\u2019s Afghanistan, whether it\u2019s Iraq, whether it\u2019s now Iran, you\u2019ve been all over the map.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago you said that\u2019s something you\u2019d never do.\n\nIn the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you\u2019re for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.\n\nWhen it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to get one man.\n\nOBAMA: And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.\n\nYou know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying \u201cPeyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you.\u201d And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, \u201cYou know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.\u201d\n\nAnd when we do things like that \u2014 when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. And I make that point because that\u2019s the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally \u2014 generally are not poll-tested. And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.\n\nBut what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right, let\u2019s go. And that leads us \u2014 this takes us right to the next segment, Governor, America\u2019s longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Bob\u2026\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor, you get to go first.\n\nROMNEY: You can\u2019t \u2014 but you can\u2019t have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.\n\nSCHIEFFER: With respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Well, that\u2019s probably true.\n\nSCHIEFFER: We\u2019ll give you \u2014 we\u2019ll catch up.\n\nThe United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government in 2014. At that point, we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americans, if I understand our policy, in Afghanistan for training purposes. It seems to me the key question here is: What do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security? Do we still leave?\n\nAnd I believe, Governor Romney, you go first?\n\nROMNEY: Well, we\u2019re going to be finished by 2014, and when I\u2019m president, we\u2019ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we\u2019re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.\n\nSo our troops will come home at that point.\n\nI can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what\u2019s happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what\u2019s happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the \u2014 in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they\u2019re rushing to build a lot more. They\u2019ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the \u2014 in the relatively near future.\n\nThey also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.\n\nAnd so we\u2019re going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.\n\nROMNEY: So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nOBAMA: When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.\n\nPart of what had happened is we\u2019d forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaida\u2019s core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nWe then started to build up Afghan forces. And we\u2019re now in a position where we can transition out, because there\u2019s no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.\n\nNow, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. We\u2019ve been there a long time, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.\n\nBut what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it\u2019s time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.\n\nOBAMA: You know, I was having lunch with some \u2014 a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office.\n\nSo those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we\u2019re making that transition in Afghanistan.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.\n\nGeneral Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan. We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama (sic) bin Laden. It still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars.\n\nIs it time for us to divorce Pakistan?\n\nROMNEY: No, it\u2019s not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.\n\nIt\u2019s a nation that\u2019s not like \u2014 like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the \u2014 of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.\n\nThis is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it \u2014 if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you\u2019ve got \u2014 you\u2019ve got terrorists there who could grab their \u2014 their hands onto those nuclear weapons.\n\nROMNEY: This is \u2014 this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is \u2014 is technically an ally, and they\u2019re not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We \u2014 we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And \u2014 and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But we\u2019re going to have to work with the \u2014 with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they\u2019re on. And it\u2019s important for them. It\u2019s important for the nuclear weapons.\n\nIt\u2019s important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a \u2014 a large group of Pashtun that are \u2014 that are Taliban. They\u2019re going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And that\u2019s one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But it\u2019s important for us to recognize that we can\u2019t just walk away from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure that as we \u2014 as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on \u2014 on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let \u2014 let me ask you, Governor because we know President Obama\u2019s position on this, what is \u2014 what is your position on the use of drones?\n\nROMNEY: Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. And it\u2019s widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. But let me also note that as I said earlier, we\u2019re going to have to do more than just going after leaders and \u2014 and killing bad guys, important as that is.\n\nROMNEY: We\u2019re also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism. We haven\u2019t done that yet. We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the \u2014 the record, you look at the record. You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is \u2014 is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels? No. Is \u2014 are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?\n\nNo, they haven\u2019t had talks in two years. We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I\u2019m convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.\n\nOBAMA: Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn\u2019t just going after bin Laden. We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.\n\nAnd what we\u2019ve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people\u2019s lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren\u2019t corrupt, to make sure that they\u2019re treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they\u2019ve got a free market system that works.\n\nSo across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy.\n\nOne thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation \u2014 me, my administration \u2014 stood with them earlier than just about any country.\n\nIn Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.\n\nIn Libya we stood on the side of the people.\n\nAnd as a consequence, there\u2019s no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.\n\nOBAMA: But we\u2019re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office. And they don\u2019t have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go to the next segment, because it\u2019s a very important one. It is the rise of China and future challenges for America. I want to just begin this by asking both of you, and Mr. President, you \u2014 you go first this time.\n\nWhat do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks. We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it\u2019s following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.\n\nI know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And that\u2019s the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. That\u2019s the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other \u2014 the previous administration had done in two terms. And we\u2019ve won just about every case that we\u2019ve filed, that has been decided.\n\nOBAMA: In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires \u2014 or \u2014 or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn\u2019t be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.\n\nBut I tell you, those workers don\u2019t feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.\n\nOver the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we\u2019ve also got to make sure, though, that we\u2019re taking \u2014 taking care of business here at home. If we don\u2019t have the best education system in the world, if we don\u2019t continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that\u2019s how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romney\u2019s budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nGovernor?\n\nROMNEY: Well, first of all, it\u2019s not government that makes business successful. It\u2019s not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.\n\nLet me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about China. China has an interest that\u2019s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They don\u2019t want war. They don\u2019t want to see protectionism. They don\u2019t want to see the world break out into \u2014 into various forms of chaos, because they have to \u2014 they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 \u2014 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.\n\nSo they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We don\u2019t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they\u2019re willing to be responsible.\n\nNow, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe \u2018em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.\n\nROMNEY: They look at our \u2014 our decision to \u2014 to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. It\u2019s not my term, it\u2019s the president\u2019s own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.\n\nThey look at America\u2019s commitments around the world and they see what\u2019s happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if I\u2019m president, America will be very strong.\n\nWe\u2019ll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. I\u2019ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods aren\u2019t as competitive and we lose jobs. That\u2019s got to end.\n\nThey\u2019re making some progress; they need to make more. That\u2019s why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they\u2019re taking jobs. They\u2019re stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.\n\nThey have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world that\u2019s stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Well, Governor, let me just ask you. If you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are \u2014 say you\u2019re just going to start a trade war with China on day one. Is that \u2014 isn\u2019t there a risk that that could happen?\n\nROMNEY: Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. So it\u2019s pretty clear who doesn\u2019t want a trade war. And there\u2019s one going on right now, which we don\u2019t know about it. It\u2019s a silent one. And they\u2019re winning.\n\nWe have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it\u2019s worse this year than last year, and it\u2019s worse last year than the year before. And so we have to understand that we can\u2019t just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively. We understand it. But this can\u2019t keep on going. You can\u2019t keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.\n\nI was with one company that makes valves and \u2014 and process industries and they said, look, we were \u2014 we were having some valves coming in that \u2014 that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and \u2014 and they had our serial number on them. And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This can\u2019t go on.\n\nI want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.\n\nOBAMA: Well, Governor Romney\u2019s right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.\n\nAnd, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re right. I mean that\u2019s how our free market works. But I\u2019ve made a different bet on American workers.\n\nIf we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we\u2019d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.\n\nIf we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don\u2019t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. Now that\u2019s estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won\u2019t be here, they\u2019ll be in places like China.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.\n\nNow with respect to what we\u2019ve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.\n\nWe absolutely have to make more progress and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep on pressing.\n\nAnd when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.\n\nAnd we believe China can be a partner, but we\u2019re also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And we\u2019re organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of leadership we\u2019ve shown in the region. That\u2019s the kind of leadership that we\u2019ll continue to show.\n\nROMNEY: I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for \u2014 for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI\u2019m a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need \u2014 these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d built up.\n\nAnd fortunately\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor Romney, that\u2019s not what you said\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor Romney, you did not\u2026\n\nROMNEY: You can take a look at the op-ed\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: You did not say that you would provide government help.\n\nROMNEY: I said that we would provide guarantees, and \u2014 and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet. And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not. Of course not.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Let\u2019s check the record.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s the height of silliness\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Let \u2014 let \u2014 let\u2019s\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: I have never said I would liquidate\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAM: \u2026at the record.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026I would liquidate the industry.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor, the people in Detroit don\u2019t forget.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026and \u2014 and that\u2019s why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. We in this country can \u2014 can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we\u2019re going to. We\u2019re going to have to have a president, however, that doesn\u2019t think that somehow the government investing in \u2014 in car companies like Tesla and \u2014 and Fisker, making electric battery cars. This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies. Investing in Solyndra. This is a company, this isn\u2019t basic research. I \u2014 I want to invest in research. Research is great. Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great. But investing in companies? Absolutely not.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s the wrong way to go.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: The fact of the matter is\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: I\u2019m still speaking. So I want to make sure that we make \u2014 we make America more competitive.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah.\n\nROMNEY: And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow. But you\u2019re investing in companies doesn\u2019t do that. In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here\u2026\n\nOBAMA: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: \u2026because the private sector\u2019s not going to invest in a\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m happy.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026company\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: \u2026to respond to you\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026if \u2014 if you\u2019re\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: \u2026you\u2019ve had the floor for a while.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026get someone else\u2019s. OBAMA: The \u2014 look, I think anybody out there can check the record. Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here. You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace. That wasn\u2019t true. They would have gone through a\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: You\u2019re wrong\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: \u2026they would have gone through a\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: \u2026you\u2019re wrong.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: No, I am not wrong. I am not wrong.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: People can look it up, you\u2019re right.\n\nOBAMA: People will look it up.\n\nROMNEY: Good.\n\nOBAMA: But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we\u2019re going to have to make some smart choices right now.\n\nCutting our education budget, that\u2019s not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China.\n\nCutting our investments in research and technology, that\u2019s not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China.\n\nBringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.\n\nThose are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.\n\nAnd the one thing that I\u2019m absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we\u2019ve now begun to make some real progress. What we can\u2019t do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. That\u2019s why we have to move forward and not go back.\n\nROMNEY: I couldn\u2019t agree more about going forward, but I certainly don\u2019t want to go back to the policies of the last four years. The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.\n\nWhen you came to office 32 million people on food stamps. Today, 47 million people on food stamps.\n\nWhen you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt. It hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nYou said by now we\u2019d be at 5.4 percent unemployment. We\u2019re 9 million jobs short of that. I\u2019ve met some of those people. I\u2019ve met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in \u2014 in Philadelphia who\u2019s coming out of \u2014 out of college, can\u2019t find work.\n\nI\u2019ve been \u2014 Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. It\u2019s just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And that\u2019s not going to happen by just hiring teachers.\n\nLook, I love to \u2014 I love teachers, and I\u2019m happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that. By the way, I don\u2019t like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools. Let the states and localities do that. I was a governor. The federal government didn\u2019t hire our teachers.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: But I love teachers. But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.\n\nSCHIEFFER: I think we all love teachers.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSCHIEFFER: Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate. We have come to the end. It is time for closing statements,\n\nI believe you\u2019re first, Mr. President.\n\nOBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University. You\u2019ve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now you\u2019ve got a choice. Over the last four years we\u2019ve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nAnd Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that\u2019s wrong and reckless, economic policies that won\u2019t create jobs, won\u2019t reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don\u2019t have to play by the same rules that you do.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And I\u2019ve put forward a plan to make sure that we\u2019re bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.\n\nI want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best education system in the world. And we\u2019re retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nI want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.\n\nYes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don\u2019t need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.\n\nAs Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we\u2019ve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices. I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.\n\nThank you.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Governor?\n\nROMNEY: Thank you.\n\nBob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you. I\u2019m optimistic about the future. I\u2019m excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. It\u2019s our objective.\n\nWe have an opportunity to have real leadership. America\u2019s going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we\u2019d have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I\u2019ll get us on track to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.\n\nThe president\u2019s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The president\u2019s path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. I\u2019ll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.\n\nI\u2019m going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.\n\nAmerica\u2019s going to come back, and for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. We\u2019ve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.\n\nThis nation is the hope of the earth. We\u2019ve been blessed by having a nation that\u2019s free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. They\u2019ve held a torch for the world to see \u2014 the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, it\u2019s our turn to take that torch. I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll do it.\n\nWe need strong leadership. I\u2019d like to be that leader with your support. I\u2019ll work with you. I\u2019ll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote. I\u2019d like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Gentlemen, thank you both so much. That brings an end to this year\u2019s debates and we want to thank Lynn University and its students for having us. As I always do at the end of these debates, I leave you with the words of my mom, who said: \u201cGo vote; it\u2019ll make you feel big and strong.\u201d\n\nGood night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)"}

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are \u201cnot a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high\u2026. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers \u2013 since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2013\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Kathleen Sebelius\n\nSecretary\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\n200 Independence Ave., SW\n\nWashington, DC 20201\n\n\n\nRE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates\n\n\n\nDear Secretary Sebelius,\n\n\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.\n\n\n\nAs you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.\n\n\n\nAs of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida\u2019s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS\u2019s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.\n\n\n\nIndeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.\n\n\n\nOver 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida\u2019s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.\n\n\n\nWhile other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers \u2013 since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # e\n\nRelated News House Passes Deutch Amendment to Promote Awareness of Mental Health and Addiction Parity Laws\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview rr\n\nPosted in Press Releases on May 16, 2019 | Preview Deutch, Castor, FL Democrats Ask Gov.

Dennis Kucinich says ExxonMobil paid no taxes in 2009 and got $156 million rebate. POLITIFACT says FALSE http://j.mp/oEZkWM @cspanwj", "article": "Rose Garden\n\n11:00 A.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry we\u2019re running just a little bit behind, but I figured it\u2019s a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.\n\nToday, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.\n\nRight now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits \u2013- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -\u2013 a subsidy that they\u2019ve enjoyed year after year for the last century.\n\nThink about that. It\u2019s like hitting the American people twice. You\u2019re already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if these companies can\u2019t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies\u2019 profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we\u2019re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.\n\nNow, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. That\u2019s why under my administration, we\u2019ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. We\u2019ve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We\u2019ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.\n\nSo the fact is, we\u2019re producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we\u2019re importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -\u2013 for the first time in over a decade.\n\nSo American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, I\u2019m not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, they\u2019ve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think it\u2019s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.\n\nInstead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that\u2019s never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. That\u2019s the future. That\u2019s the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. That\u2019s not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.\n\nAnd keep in mind, we can\u2019t just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil but we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we\u2019d still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. We\u2019d still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because it\u2019s a world market, the fact that we\u2019re doing more here in the United States doesn\u2019t necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies they\u2019re selling that oil on a worldwide market. They\u2019re not keeping it just for us. And that means that if there\u2019s rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.\n\nThat\u2019s not the future that I want for America. I don\u2019t want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there\u2019s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there\u2019s going to be enough supply. I don\u2019t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.\n\nI want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And that\u2019s why, as long as I\u2019m President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that we\u2019re going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that\u2019s already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. We\u2019re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. We\u2019re going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you\u2019re in charge of your own energy bills.\n\nWe\u2019re going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. That\u2019s what we need to keep going. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. That\u2019s the choice that we face. And that\u2019s the choice that\u2019s facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren\u2019t needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nAnd as long as I\u2019m President, I\u2019m betting on the future. And as the people I\u2019ve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. That\u2019s what we do as Americans. That\u2019s who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that we\u2019re going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:08 A.M. EDT"}

Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients.\n\nJoining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome.\n\nGOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us.\n\nCORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you.\n\nTAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, \"Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.\"\n\nSenator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you?\n\nBROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there.\n\nCORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place.\n\nI think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed?\n\nGOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate?\n\nCORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening.\n\nAnd I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything.\n\nThis is something, by the way, that everyone has committed to try to do, and that is to have this bipartisan agreement before it goes to the floor. I think it's important that we do so.\n\nTAPPER: So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?\n\nCORKER: I think that's very likely. And I do want to say that we voted this bill, 1336 pages, we voted it out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement.\n\nSo again, we just want to see what was stated honored. And I know Sherrod Brown and Austan both know I want to see a bill. But I think, again, having this template done first is very, very important. It's very likely, I think it's almost a given, that if we don't reach that bipartisan agreement, that Republicans will probably want to put in place something that allows those negotiations to keep going for a while until we do that. So yes, 41 Republicans in my opinion would block it unless we reached this agreement, which we've all stated needs to occur.\n\nTAPPER: Senator Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Senator Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?\n\nBROWN: Yes, it does. It can do it better, and Senator Corker was part of the negotiations that deal with the resolution authority. But I also--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Just to interject, the resolution authority is for the federal government to come in, and if there is a failing financial system, to take over and liquidate that firm. I'm sorry, Senator Brown, go on.\n\nBROWN: But let me go back to something Bob just said, then I'll answer the question more specifically. You know, some Wall Street people have said the longer they can delay this, the more chance they can kill it. And I just don't want to see it delayed. We've been -- two years ago was the Bear Stearns problem. Ever since then, Senator Dodd in November put out a working draft. He then put teams together, including Senator Corker and Senator Warner and Gregg and others and Senator Dodd and Shelby, and it's -- and Senator Reed, and Jack Reed was part of that too -- so we've been working on this for a long time.\n\nI hope that tomorrow night when we have a vote -- all we're asking tomorrow night is 60 votes. We need a Republican or two or three to simply say, let's move forward and debate, and then Bob Corker and I and others can offer any kinds of amendments we want. So I hope that they will not en masse -- and put it this way, I wish there were more Bob Corkers in the Senate Republican caucus, because he's been very open with negotiations. And then Senator Shelby and Senator -- Minority Leader McConnell pulled them back, I think on behalf of Wall Street lobbyists.\n\nBut put that aside, in terms of too-big-to-fail, we do have this resolution authority. It's well done, written by Senator Corker and Senator Dodd and some others bipartisanly. I think we need to do more to prevent too big, though. Too-big-to-fail is too big, and my amendment that Senator Kaufman from Delaware and I are offering next week or the week after will basically say that we'll put some limits on the size of these banks.\n\nLet me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake. Fifteen years ago, the six -- the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP, and that's too -- we've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.\n\nTAPPER: And Austan, Senator Brown is going to introduce an amendment that would cap the amount a bank can borrow to finance operations at 2 percent of GDP, 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Wouldn't that actually stop too-big-to-fail by preventing these banks from being too big? And why isn't the administration behind that?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, the president is totally committed and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore. We can open -- we're open to negotiating details obviously as we start getting into it. They're complicated. Some of these financial risks are more like worms where you could chop them in half, but it doesn't kill them, it just gives you two different worms. Bear Stearns, AIG, they weren't the biggest, they were just the most dangerous, and we've got to come at this from every side.\n\nLook, we're open to looking at ending too-big-to-fail on the size angle, on the what risky investments they're allowed to take, looking at the derivatives component so that AIG-like, they can't threaten to blow up the whole world because of -- because they have some of this $600 trillion pool of derivatives that we know virtually nothing about, that are in the dark. All of that ends when we sign this bill. If you look at the bill and take a step back -- I don't know much about the legislative strategies that are going on in the Senate. They are important. I do know that the president has laid out what this bill does, is we're going to end bailouts, we're going to hold accountable the people that get into the messes. So if they get in trouble, they fail. All we're going to do is pay funeral expenses, and we're going to have the strongest consumer protections ever in this country.\n\nTAPPER: Let me stop you right there, because you said that we're going to hold accountable the people that get us into these messes. But Senator Corker, I think one of the problems that a lot of the American people have with bailouts and with this legislation is that they feel that after these firms fail, or are propped up by the U.S. taxpayer, they take billions of taxpayer dollars, then the CEOs and the board members drive off in their Austin Martins to their $20 million houses in the Hamptons with their $500 million in the bank, and there's no accountability whatsoever. Is there anything in this bill that provides any personal accountability for these CEOs?\n\nCORKER: Before I answer that, let me refer to something Senator Brown said. I -- nobody pulled me back from negotiations. The fact is that Senator Dodd, and he said this publicly, left me at the altar. And the reason was, as we negotiated, Democrats were being lost, and I think he wanted to get the bill out of committee on a party-line vote. I mean, he has stated that publicly. So nobody has pulled me back. I'm my own person and I want to get a good bill here.\n\nBut back to the question you're asking. There is no question, and I think that first of all, I plan to offer changes to this resolution authority that say that, if a large entity like this has to go through this resolution where in essence they're liquidated in an orderly way, I think that everything that the executive team and the board members have earned through this company over the last five years needs to be clawed back. In other words, there needs to be some penalties assessed to the management that have caused the country to have to go through this orderly liquidation process. So absolutely, I will be offering an amendment that deals with that, so that we're taking back, we're clawing back all the earnings that management has made out of this firm, if it has to go through orderly liquidation. I think that's very appropriate, and certainly I'm going to be doing that on the floor if it doesn't make it into the base bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can the White House get behind that clawback provision? Are you being out-populisted by Republicans?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, look, in the bill now -- the president went to Cooper Union this last week to revisit the spot where more than two years ago, he went and said we need to have fundamental reform--\n\nTAPPER: But there is no clawback in this bill?\n\nGOOLSBEE: There is a requirement that they're all fired. If you get to that point, all the management is fired--\n\nTAPPER: So they take their $500 million to their home in the Hamptons.\n\nGOOLSBEE: -- all the shareholders are wiped out. Well, look, as I say, on any details, we're open to looking at negotiating the details of how we carry out the president's principles. But if negotiation -- and Senator Corker, to his credit, is not in this camp -- but if the negotiators are going to come forward more as a delaying tactic and we're just going to put in hundreds of amendments and try to keep this going so as to stall, delay and kill reform, that's not going to happen. This is going to pass.\n\nCORKER: Well, let me--\n\nTAPPER: One of the big -- let me just move on to another subject if I could, but we will get back to you, Senator Corker. One of the big debates going on within the Democratic caucus is how strong the derivative legislation should be. Derivatives are these risky bets that big money men and women make on whether or not an industry will rise or fall in value, and it's a way to hedge a lot of risk.\n\nSenator Brown, you are in favor of Senator Lincoln's provision, Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas. She wants to say, if you're a bank and you have federally insured money, you have to separate these derivatives traders. It's too risky what they do. We should not have any connection with taxpayer insured money. Do you think that the Democrats are going to put that in the bill? And if not, why not?\n\nBROWN: Well, I hope so and I think so. I -- this goes back to really your first question on the conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that you really can't serve two masters. You can't serve your clients and serve yourself and play these transactions one off against another. And I think that these -- anything we do in this bill, whether it's consumer protection standalone -- I hope that the Consumer Protection Agency, whether it's regulation of derivatives, whether it's too-big-to-fail, whether it's the Volcker rule separating out proprietary trading and, as I say, from standard banking practices. Any of those conflicts of interests, we have to address in this bill, and I think that -- I think that Senator Lincoln and her draft in the Agriculture Committee that we voted out last week, we got one Republican supporting it, Senator Grassley did. And I think that was a good sign. I think it means that there will be a number of Republicans that are as open-minded as Senator Corker, that will want to move forward Monday night.\n\nAnd again, just to let us begin the debate. I mean, the Monday vote is going to be -- are we going to start the debate or are we going to shut it down and continue negotiating, negotiating, negotiating. I, to me, the legislative process is, you put a bill on the floor and then Bob Corker offers his amendment that I like that he just mentioned, in terms of in the resolution authority, what to do with these executives that brought us there. I offer my amendment on too-big-to-fail means too big. Dozens of other amendments will be offered, we'll see what happens, and then we vote on a bill.\n\nTAPPER: Austan, can you get behind Senator Lincoln's provision to separate derivatives trading from banks that have federally insured deposits?\n\nGOOLSBEE: If you take a step back, this issue of derivatives is totally central. Now, three years ago, virtually no one in America had even heard of derivatives, or if they had, they had nightmares of their, you know, college math class or something. The fact is that there are now $600 trillion of derivatives that are trading in the dark, that we know virtually nothing about and are unregulated. And it's not just a party that's taking place on Wall Street that has no impact on America. They're exactly the things that threatened to blow up the entire financial system with AIG. So the president's completely committed that we are going to bring the $600 trillion out into the open and under the regulatory umbrella.\n\nNow, I think we made great progress that in both the Dodd and Lincoln's versions of what would happen with derivatives, we purged a bunch of the loopholes that some of the banks had gotten put into the bills before. The president is not going to allow putting loopholes in that let these $600 trillion get back into the dark and threaten the whole system.\n\nWe can work on the -- so the--\n\nTAPPER: But you guys--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: -- don't support separating it, though, right?\n\nGOOLSBEE: Well, there are several very technical aspects of difference between the Lincoln bill and the Dodd bill--\n\nTAPPER: It's not really actually that technical, whether or not--\n\nGOOLSBEE: I don't agree with that.\n\nTAPPER: It's whether or not commercial banks should be able to do this. Senator Corker, I hear you giggling--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: You think Senator Lincoln's provision goes a little too far, right? Senator Corker?\n\nCORKER: Are you talking to--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Yes, yes, of course, Senator Corker.\n\nCORKER: Yes. Yes, I mean, I think what -- I think what Austan is saying is he doesn't support it. And I don't either. Let me say this, I want to see as much traded through clearinghouses as possible. I absolutely agree that that needs to occur. We don't want to force those things that are not liquid to be traded on the clearinghouse, but I'm on the side of let's get as much as possible.\n\nThe fact is that Senator Brown is in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. I'm in a state where a lot of manufacturing takes place. And what people don't I think appreciate so much is that all of these tools are used for capital formation. They help companies hedge their risk. They help companies create capital, and I think if we start drawing lines in the sand where we take these tools away, what we really do is hamper companies' ability to access capital. So I don't think separation is appropriate. I do think clearing as much as possible so that on a daily basis, if somebody is money bad, they have to put money up to be money good or neutral, so that we don't end up in the kind of situation we have with AIG. But I think it hampers our ability, again, to create great companies if we just create an absolute separation.\n\nTAPPER: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have. It was a great debate, and I really thank you, Senator Corker in Chattanooga, Senator Brown in Cincinnati and Austan Goolsbee here in the studio. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.\n\nAs our roundtable takes their seats, take a look at how Saturday Night Live portrayed the president's speech on Thursday, pitching reform to Wall Street executives.\n\nTAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable, as always. George Will, Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Paul Krugman of the New York Times and Alexis Glick, former vice president at Fox Business News. Thank you all for joining us.\n\nGeorge, does this legislation end too-big-to-fail?\n\nWILL: No, because that's not the problem. It's -- we all sort of sympathize with Sherrod Brown and Senator Kaufman's idea that if it's too big to fail, it's too big to exist. The problem is it's not scale, it's connectedness that poses so-called system risk. And what people are arguing about is whether or not they have accurately located risk to the entire system.\n\nThis is an unusual argument. Usually in Washington when there's controversy about a bill, the two sides agree about what the bill does but not whether it ought to be done. In this case, there's an argument about whether or not the bill will actually do what it sets out to do.\n\nBoth sides want to guarantee the obliteration of certain kinds of failed firms. They want the management to go and they want shareholder equity to disappear. So it's a competition to see who can be most beastly to these bad companies. And the question is whether or not this happens.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia, it's unclear right now if there's going to be a bipartisan compromise, but you heard Senator Corker say that the negotiations should continue. You don't really have a lot of faith in that.\n\nTUCKER: No, and the Democrats don't either, for good reason. We saw this tactic used with health care reform, when Max Baucus was given months to negotiate with Republicans. At the end of the day there wasn't a single Senate Republican voting for health care reform. So, you know, Mitch McConnell came out just a few weeks ago and said, let's start over with this financial reform bill. That was the very same tactic used with health care reform. So Democrats need to be leery of this idea of negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. It gives the lobbyists time to lobby more, give more campaign contributions, and it gives the Republicans time to foment opposition by mischaracterizing the bill. So I think Chris Dodd is very leery.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Can I interject for one second on the campaign contributions, and I'll come to you in a second, Paul. But the Center for Responsive Politics did a study of campaign contributions, and in this cycle, the finance, insurance and real estate sectors are giving much more to Democrats than to Republicans. $65 million to $51 million. Paul, do you think the Democratic Party is too close to Wall Street?\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, it has been in the past for sure. No question that in the late '90s, the Clinton team -- some of whom are now in the administration -- were way too close to Wall Street. They believed that these were wise men who knew what they were doing. And no, at this point, it's the party in power, of course, is going to be getting a lot more contributions. It's kind of -- that's not too surprising.\n\nLet me say a couple of things here. Anyone who says we need to be bipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been trying to stop reform with possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history of politics, which is the claim that having regulation of the banks is actually bailing out the banks. And basically, the argument boils down to saying that what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolish the fire department. Because then people will know that they can't let their buildings burn in the first place, right? It's incredible.\n\nSo anyone who says bipartisan, should say, you know, bipartisan doesn't include the Senate minority leader. But, you know, I agree with George, actually, believe it or not. Too big to fail per se is not the problem. The Great Depression was made possible by the failure of the Bank of the United States, which despite its name, was a Bronx-based institution that was the 28th largest financial institution in the United States at the time, and yet brought the whole system down.\n\nBut what we are getting now in this bill is a way to have graceful failure of big institutions, right? We know how to deal with small banks. The FDIC seized seven banks last week that were on the verge of failing and let them, you know, liquidated them gracefully, but we don't have a way of dealing with complex, you know, what we call shadow banking institutions like Lehman or Citigroup. And this bill would give you that. So it would give you the ability to do for big, complicated financial institutions what we've been doing routinely for small ones, and that does -- so it doesn't end the too big, but it may deal with the fail bit.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, you, unlike a lot of business journalists, actually have worked in business. You've done trading at Goldman Sachs, at Morgan Stanley. What do you think of this regulation bill? Do you think the derivatives monitoring and separation that Senator Lincoln is trying to do, do you think that goes too far?\n\nGLICK: Well, look, bottom line is, I think when you look at the derivative equation, do we need transparency? Should there be a central clearing facility? Absolutely. It is without a doubt the wild west. It is all about that shadow banking market, that black market. We have not been able to see who is on the other side of that transaction.\n\nI do believe that it's going too far to say that large financial institutions cannot have a derivative business. Believe you me, I don't want to see one American deposit in this country used as a tool to go out on a proprietary basis for a firm's capital to go out and trade in derivatives. I don't like that. But when you come back to this too big to fail, just to pick up on what you said, the FDIC has done a phenomenal job throughout this financial crisis. No depositor has lost a dime. They've been able to wind down financial institutions in a very, very smart and effective way. The question here on resolution authority is what--\n\nTAPPER: The ability of the government -- I told you I'll do this -- the ability of the government to step in and wind down a financial institution that's failing. Go.\n\nGLICK: Good job! The bill -- the question here is all those other institutions who have a financial arm, as we talked about earlier. It's the GM situations where they have a finance arm, it's the GE Capitals of the world. Where do these guys fit into this equation when they may be in the manufacturing business or in other business?\n\nWILL: That's precisely what worries Republicans. They think this is a thin end of an enormous wedge that is going to get the government deeper into treating capital and credit in this country as a public utility, to be priced and allocated here in Washington, which is, they think, inevitably a recipe for something like crony capitalism. Because you have somewhat not slippery, but open-textured definitions. Non-bank financial institution. Well, GMAC gets General Motors brought under TARP, and in this case, GE Capital would get all of General Electric, or would it? We don't know. Would it be a segment of General Electric brought under this bill?\n\nKRUGMAN: And yet there's no alternative. Meaning if we only protect banks in the traditional sense, which are big marble buildings with rows of tellers, you're missing 60 percent of the modern banking system. The fact of the matter is, there are lots of things out there, money market funds, repo. (inaudible), but things that functionally play the same role as bank deposits, that can destabilize the economy the same way as bank deposits, and so we have to bring those under the umbrella. Now, we can quibble with details, but something like this has to be done.\n\nTAPPER: Let me just interject for one second. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, our roundtable will take up Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigrants and what will the impact be on immigration reform. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJAY LENO: He just played golf for the 32nd time in his presidency.

Let me start before we discuss this bill and what it actually does by going into one of the most controversial provisions in this new law, Arizona Senate bill 1070. \"For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official, where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, s reasonable attempt shall be made when practicable to determine the immigration status of the person.\"\n\n\"Reasonable suspicion\" that the person is an alien. What does that mean, George?\n\nWILL: Well, the Fourth Amendment says there should be no unreasonable searches and seizures, and we've generated volumes of case law trying to sort out what that means over the last century or so. So it's not clear what that means. Let's say this about Arizona. They have 460,000, an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants there. So before Washington lectures Arizonans on irresponsibility, perhaps Washington ought to attend to the central attribute of national sovereignty which is to control the borders. We are the only developed nation in the world with a 2,000 mile border with an undeveloped country and we have a magnet of a welfare state to the north.\n\nSo this is not Arizona's fault. Beyond that, this should be said however. Reasonable suspicion is going to put upon the police of Arizona a terribly difficult job. This is what the governor said. \"We must enforce the law evenly and without regard to skin color, accent or social status.\" I don't know how do you that.\n\nTAPPER: Well Cynthia, how do you do that? The governor put out an executive order saying that there should be no racial order that there should be no racial profiling with this law. But if you're a police man and you've been told -- and by the way, you can be sued now under this law if you're not doing enough, if the citizens are convinced you're not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration. If you're a policeman, what's enough? What's reasonable to think somebody might be an illegal immigrant?\n\nTUCKER: Well Jake, several law enforcement agencies have actually opposed the bill. Not only for that reason because they have no idea what it means to say reasonable suspicion. A California Republican has said you can tell an illegal immigrant by the shoes they wear. Of course this is an invitation to racial profiling. Everyone with a Spanish surname, everyone with a certain look, you may or may not be Latino. There are people in my family who look as if they could be Latino. It harkens back to apartheid where all black people in South Africa were required to carry documents in order to move from one part of town to another.\n\nAnd let me just say this about Arizona's problems with the border, it is absolutely true that Arizona has problems with the border. A rancher was killed apparently by drug smugglers. But this has absolutely no bearing on that problem. All it does is open the doors for harassment of citizens.\n\nTAPPER: Let's you talk about that rancher for a second. His name was Robert Krentz and he was killed in March. Here's a friend of him, Steve Brophy, talking about his friend's death.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEVE BROPHY, KRENTZ'S FRIEND: You cannot allow a border in our country that is akin in lawlessness to that of west Waziristan in Pakistan. It's simply intolerable, not just for Rob Krentz and not just for the Krentz family but for her entire country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Doesn't he have a point, Paul? I mean this is federal failure at the border.\n\nKRUGMAN: Yes, we have never put in enough money is basically what it comes down to enforce the border control. It's not a deep issue of principle, it's just a question of resources. People have been willing to be very -- talk tough about it but actually not willing to do reasonable stuff in terms of enforcement. And it's going to be a problem. But what I want to go back to here is not just apartheid issues, but think about a different way.\n\nWe have these massive protests in this country about alleged authoritarian tendencies that we are going to have some kind of -- inside the Obama/Hitler stuff -- the idea that the government is encroaching too much in our lives.\n\nAnd now all of the sudden, we have by pretty much the same people, demanding that we set up a system that will turn us into one of those apocryphal foreign authoritarian regimes where the police are saying hand over your papers, right? A world where you constantly have to prove who you are. And yes, it will be racial profiling but who knows what else? I mean, some people take me I look like President Lula of Brazil, so I might end up being pulled over when I'm on my morning walk, right?\n\nTAPPER: I think you're much better looking than the president of Brazil.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: But you know, it's interesting that you say that, because you are not the only one to evoke that, let me see your papers thing.\n\nKRUGMAN: Right.\n\nTAPPER: Cardinal Roger Mahoney on his blog wrote, quote, \"American people are fair-minded and respectful. I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.\"\n\nAnd now, Alexis, we have Senator Harry Reid and President Obama talking about immigration reform again. We thought it was dead, we thought it wasn't going to be brought up, but it looks like this is going to be a big issue in Washington.\n\nGLICK: You know, I think at first glance, most people say, hey, wait a second. We're been trying to tackle too much too quickly. But the bottom line here is if -- this is a bill that will be the catalyst, if what has happened in Arizona is the thing that gets people moving in Washington, D.C. to address things like the border, then so be it.\n\nI saw Senator Lindsey Graham came out the other day and said, oh, wait a second, I've been working, I'm not going to show up at the conference on cap-and-trade because we said cap-and-trade is first before we're going to address -- or climate change is first before we're going to address immigration. The bottom line, we have to address immigration. 11 million immigrants in this country. We have got an unemployment rate in this country at 26-, 27-year high. We have to address citizens and what they are going to take of the piece of the pie, what they should get in addition to what taxes they should get, what services they're going to be offered.\n\nThis is an issue that has been plaguing us. We have got to address it.\n\nWILL: Again, in defense of Arizona, large majority of Arizonans support this bill and a large majority of Arizonans are not, by definition, the fringe of the state. They are temperate, decent people with a huge problem.\n\nWhat the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime. Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to do this in a professional way.\n\nTAPPER: And we should point out, some police organizations in Arizona do support it, although Cynthia, it's interesting, President Obama had this to say on the North Lawn of the White House, or, I'm sorry, in the Rose Garden of the White House the other day, even before the law was passed.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation. But if we continue to fail to act at a federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Obviously that's a call for immigration reform, but in addition, is he asking the Justice Department to look into whether or not they should block this law?\n\nTUCKER: No, I think they are looking -- first of all, I think the Justice Department lawyers and the Civil Rights Division probably spent the weekend trying to figure out what they can do, looking at the bill itself, the law now, and trying to figure out where there might be civil rights violations. Unreasonable search and seizure is one place for them to look.\n\nBut the Justice Department doesn't have to do anything. There will be other organizations that have already said that they are planning lawsuits against this. So it will be in court shortly.\n\nLet me say this about immigration reform, though. If we thought health care reform was divisive, this is going to be an all-out battle, and will even create fissures in the Democratic Party. That's why Speaker Pelosi has said we will act, but only if the Senate acts first.\n\nTAPPER: She's no fool. The Senate -- President Obama has been saying -- pointing out that there were 11 Republican senators who supported immigration reform in 2007 when it failed, and suggesting that they need to support it now. I don't think they're going to support it, though.\n\nKRUGMAN: Well, politically, though, this is one of those issues that cuts right through the middle of both parties. The Democrats, it's on the one hand, Democrats tend to be pro-labor, which means they are worried about immigration; on the other hand, they tend to be -- it is the party that now gets most of the Hispanic votes, it's the party that generally is for inclusiveness. So the Democrats are divided. Many of them divided within their own hearts. It's an interesting thing, it's not so much different wings of the party as each individual Democrat tends to be kind of torn about this.\n\nRepublicans are divided between the sort of cultural conservative wing, the preserve America as the way it is, and the business wing, which likes having inexpensive immigrant labor. So this is one heck of an issue. It's going to -- it's deeply divisive among both parties, which is one reason not to rush it, to push it at the top of the agenda right now.\n\nI'm kind of upset at the notion that this might push climate change off this year, because we don't do climate change legislation. I'm ready for that one, George. If we don't do that this year, we won't do it for quite a few years to come.\n\nGLICK: I thought one of the most interesting things is Senator McCain's stance on this, someone who talked a lot on the campaign trail and has been very vocal about needing comprehensive immigration reform. I understand he's fighting a tight race and a tight battle there, but I thought that was very telling, when you go back to what -- how will this impact the mid-term elections. Is this about what will happen to that Hispanic vote? Is this about what you need to do in these short-term elections to get the necessary votes? I thought that was a very telling sign that in the last hours, he decided to back it.\n\nWILL: But the problem, as in my judgment with health care, is that word comprehensive. Instead of making little, bite-sized, incremental improvements, we have to do everything at once. That's partly because this is all being held hostage by the immigrant advocacy groups in the country. But if we would close the border, guarantee that we were not going to have serial amnesties far into the future--\n\nGLICK: So put the 3,000 troops on the border as McCain suggests.\n\nWILL: Build a fence, do what McCain suggests, and you'll find that the American people are not xenophobic, they are not irrational on the subject, but they do want this essential attribute of national sovereignty asserted.\n\nTUCKER: And where does the money come from for that, George?\n\nWILL: It's a rounding error on the GM bailout.\n\nTUCKER: Sealing the border would be much more difficult than advocates for that idea suggest. It's a very long border, 2,000 miles, George.\n\nTAPPER: We're only talking about the southern border, right? We're not trying to keep the Canadians out?\n\nTUCKER: The southern border---\n\nWILL: You're profiling.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRUGMAN: -- different from you and me, eh?\n\nTUCKER: And technology doesn't work that we thought we can depend on, doesn't work nearly as well as its advocates suggested either. So we're talking about people, standing up border guards, National Guard, Army troops on the border if we really want to seal it off.\n\nKRUGMAN: The truth is, in the modern world, sealing borders is a lot harder than you want to imagine. Nobody is able to keep out at least a fair amount of illegal immigration. The Europeans can't. The Japanese can't. Japan is an island, and it's very easy to tell who's not Japanese, and even so they have a lot of illegal immigrants.\n\nGLICK: But you can see to George's point of view, as I was saying to you guys before, when I sent out a message on Twitter about this and I said to people, what do you think about immigration reform? A lot of the messages I got back were from people in Arizona who say they support this bill because they see what's going on, on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNow, I don't agree with it. I think there is a very dangerous precedent being set, but what it does show you is that more and more states, particularly on the border there, are going to have to address this on their own if we don't take it up as a bigger issue.\n\nTAPPER: I want to get to one other state very, very quickly, because we only have a couple of minutes, and that is in the next week, we're going to have a decision from the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, who is running for Senate, about whether or not he's going to drop out of the race. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the former speaker of the Florida House, Marco Rubio, would wallop Crist in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 33 percent. But if Crist runs as an independent, George, Crist 32 percent; Rubio 30 percent; Democratic Congressman Kendrick Meek, 24 percent. Very quickly, isn't this his only option?\n\nWILL: No. He can lose honorably, as has happened before with other people, wait two years, and run against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Nelson. Or having experienced a 50-point swing against him in about six months, he can go off. He has already lost his campaign manager, former Senator Connie Mack. He's infuriated by vetoing an education reform bill to curry favor with the teachers unions Jeb Bush, the most popular politician in the state. This is hara-kiri on the part of this man.\n\nTAPPER: Paul, very quickly.\n\nKRUGMAN: This is the narrowing of the Republican Party. Republican Party has swung hard right. There is no room for a moderately conservative but still middle-of-the-road politician in it, and Charlie Crist has just found that out, rather late in the game I might say.\n\nTAPPER: Cynthia?\n\nTUCKER: You know, he has -- his politics haven't changed. He has always worked across the aisle with Democrats. He's always been moderately conservative. But this shows how much the Republican Party in Florida has changed. It's that hug, when President Obama came to Florida to talk about the stimulus package, there was that moment in video where they did a man hug, and that is killing Charlie Crist and the Republican Party.\n\nTAPPER: Alexis, very quickly, how much of this is about the stimulus, about the fact that Crist embraced the stimulus?\n\nGLICK: Absolutely bingo to me. This is the perfect example for Republicans across the country who will say, hey, look, I didn't support the stimulus package. Look at what's happening to a guy who did support it. I think that's going to be a big issue of debate here. And I also think the second issue is Tea Party. Rubio supported by the Tea Party. If the Republicans want to figure out how to embrace Tea Party candidates, here's an example.\n\nTAPPER: All right, well, the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where you can also check out our fact checks."}
{"comment_3": "Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton's Emails https://t.co/vCbIQLxhNk", "split": "gen", "comment_2": "Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n https://t.co/M1cmRcxFDn", "target": "real", "comment_1": "Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton's Emails NancyHarvey: https://t.co/1mUeYVQPbV", "article": "Factsheets\n\nUpdated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n\nWe\u2019ve put all of the information about Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department emails here. Just the facts, all in one place.\n\nWhy did Clinton use her own email account?\n\nWhen Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.\n\nThat is the only reason she used her own account.\n\nHer usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.\n\nAs Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.\n\nWas it allowed?\n\nYes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.\n\nThe 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that \"[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.\n\nAs she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their \".gov\" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department\u2019s email system before she provided them with paper copies.\n\nA Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: \"In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.\"\n\nClinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?\n\nClinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.\n\nWhen information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nAfter reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.\n\nClinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.\n\nHow did Clinton receive and consume classified information?\n\nThe Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.\n\nA separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.\n\nIs Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email use?\n\nNo. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton\u2019s email account.\n\nIs it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?\n\nAgain, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.\n\nClinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.\n\nWhen the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.\n\nWould this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?\n\nEven if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.\n\nWhile the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.\n\nHave Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?\n\nWe understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.\n\nClinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.\n\nPress reports say she used multiple devices \u2013 a Blackberry and an iPad \u2013 is that true?\n\nClinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.\n\nWas she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-\".gov\" email account?\n\nThe State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their \".gov\" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.\n\nWhat did Clinton provide to the State Department?\n\nOn December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by \"state.gov\" accounts.\n\nEarly in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.\n\nWhy did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?\n\nIn fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.\n\nAt the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.\n\nWhy didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?\n\nIn 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.\n\nClinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department\u2019s email system.\n\nIn providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related\u2014including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting\u2014erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were \"personal\" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).\n\nAfter providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.\n\nWhy did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?\n\nThe State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department\u2019s requirements under the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.\n\nWhile this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.\n\nWhy did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.\n\nDid Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?\n\nNo. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emails\u2014they were not federal records or even work-related\u2014and therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoena\u2014which did not exist at the time\u2014that was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.\n\nRep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were \"purely personal in nature.\"\n\nIn March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. Gowdy\u2019s committee.\n\nRep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.\n\nAs Vox reported, \"[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. \u2026 Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server.\" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, \"Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' Clinton\u2019s campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making.\" Politifact added, \"Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.\"\n\nVox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, \"[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.\"\n\nWhy was the State Department given printed copies?\n\nThat is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that \"until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records.\" [5 FAM 443.3].\n\nWere any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?\n\nNo.\n\nHow many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?\n\nHer email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.\n\nHow and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nFollowing conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.\n\nA search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.\n\nAfter this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a \".gov\" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.\n\nTo help identify any potential non-\".gov\" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.\n\nNext, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.\n\nLastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: \"Benghazi\" and \"Libya.\"\n\nThese additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.\n\nWith respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nGiven Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 \u2013 prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.\n\nThe review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.\n\nDid Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?\n\nDuring her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.\n\nDid she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?\n\nShe provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.\n\nDo you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?\n\nThe Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance \"designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials.\" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].\n\nClinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.\n\nAfter her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.\n\nGovernment officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.\n\nCan't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?\n\nBecause the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.\n\nSome of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?\n\nAs Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officials\u2019 personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.\n\nWhere was the server for her email located?\n\nThe server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.\n\nWhat level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?\n\nThe security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.\n\nWas the server ever hacked?\n\nNo, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.\n\nWas there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as \"Guccifer\" hacked Sid Blumenthal\u2019s account?\n\nWhile this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.\n\nWas the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?\n\nYes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.\n\nFor example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.\n\nThis example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-\".gov\" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was Clinton\u2019s practice to forward it to officials at their \"state.gov\" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce Clinton\u2019s emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts."}

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n"}

Good to see you.\n\nSo, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIf they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.\n\nThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBen Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.\n\nWe think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.\n\nNow, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.\n\nTAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?\n\nGEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.\n\nTAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --\n\nGEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.\n\nTAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?\n\nGEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.\n\nTAPPER: So, before the election?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.\n\nTAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.\n\nAre you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus?\n\nGEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.\n\nTAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that.\n\nGEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.\n\nNow, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.\n\nTAPPER: By the private sector.\n\nGEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession.\n\nTAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.\n\nGEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical.\n\nAnd you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress.\n\nTAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.\n\nGiven the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.\n\nTAPPER: Many of the details on the Wall Street Reform Bill that President Obama just signed will be determined by regulators. In fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.\n\nWhy should we be confident that they're going to get it right either with the rule making or next time there's a crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: Excellent question. But actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators. It does two very important things, though. It'll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nBut it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nation's largest institutions. That authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.\n\nTAPPER: Will these powers have allowed you, if had been Secretary of Treasury at the time or your predecessor Hank Paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't think there's any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises. But if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily. It would have caused much less damage. It would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes Americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.\n\nTAPPER: You eluded to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created. Many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say there's one person they want for that job. Elizabeth Warren. The woman who thought it up.\n\nDo you support that idea?\n\nGEITHNER: She is a enormously effective advocate for reform. Probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country. She has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.\n\nTAPPER: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.\n\nGEITHNER: And even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of what's happening in the housing market and credit market. So she has enormous credibility and she'd be an excellent leader of that institution. But that's a decision the President's going to make.\n\nTAPPER: Some in the White House say that -- that you've had concerns about her appointment because she she's been a sharp critic of you, she's been a sharp critic of Treasury Department policies. Do you have concerns?\n\nGEITHNER: I don't have concerns and I should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis. You know, put out this financial fire.\n\nTAPPER: Ken Feinberg issued a report including that U.S. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown. Seventeen banks made these payouts after getting TARP funds, after getting bailout funds.\n\nGEITHNER: It's a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing. And that's what he reminded of which is in early '09, on the basis of performance in '08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.\n\nTAPPER: Is there nothing that can be done about this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week. What he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward. So you didn't have taxpayers' money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.\n\nNow, what he's also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole. So, he's done a great job. Very tough judgments. Limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.\n\nTAPPER: Why is it that U.S. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called \"haircuts\"? Salary reductions, layoffs. And banks didn't. Banks -- I mean, you had Ken Feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving TARP money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted. How come banks didn't have to do that?\n\nGEITHNER: Great question. And that's why we have financial reform. Because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure. We did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.\n\nThat was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like AIG or Lehman or Bear Stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses. But what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority. A type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill. Banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures. We don't want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures. And we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.\n\nTAPPER: The Treasury Department issued a currency report and concluded that China was not manipulating its currency. Very few legislators on Capitol Hill seem to agree with that report, and I'm wondering if you agree with it.\n\nGEITHNER: Well, what China did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.\n\nNow, of course, they just started that process. It's just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of China's trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move. What matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.\n\nTAPPER: But you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that China is not manipulating its currency?\n\nGEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. But again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces. That's very good for China. It's very good for the United States.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, this has been an odd week for the Obama administration -- not necessarily for the Treasury Department, but for the Obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with Shirley Sherrod and the Agriculture Department. President Obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration. Secretary Vilsack said something similar.\n\nDid you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?\n\nGEITHNER: Well, as the president said, I think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press. And I think I agree with it -- it's something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully. But he spoke to that, I thought, well earlier this week.\n\nTAPPER: Secretary Geithner, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nGEITHNER: Thanks, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: And joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie. Governor, thank you so much. Welcome to \"This Week.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: I'm happy to be here.\n\nTAPPER: So, Governor, your victory last November in the very blue state of New Jersey was heralded by Republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories. Now, a lot of Republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent Democratic Governor Corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if, first of all, you agree with that. And, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what Republicans can do this November?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first off, Jake, I think what we did in New Jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in. We said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I didn't go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and I didn't think it was the right thing to do.\n\nNow, in terms of what it tells us going forward, I think Republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and I think that is the Republican brand. It's why I became a Republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.\n\nAnd so I think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as Republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in New Jersey and across the country.\n\nTAPPER: You know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in New Jersey. Here you are on CNBC.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: We passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our state's budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of New Jersey.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University, says, quote, \"That's a nice talking point, but it's absolutely untrue. There are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.\" And the Star-Ledger reported, \"Budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs. The budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern Christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the state's formula for education aid.\"\n\nSo these billions that you're not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat? How does this work? Because they're legal obligations, right?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, listen, the legislature passed this budget. The budget I presented on March 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the Corzine administration.\n\nAnd so Patrick Murray is a pollster, and he's OK as a pollster, but he's not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding. Well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the Corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole. Really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.\n\nAcross the board, Jake, we had to reduce spending. Every department of state government was cut. And so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.\n\nFinally, on pensions, I wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system. We need pension reform. I passed some already for new hires in March, and now this fall we're going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because we're going broke.\n\nTAPPER: Now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of New Jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate. That means that people's property taxes are going to go up.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, no, what we did, Jake, was we did a couple of things. First, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit. We spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people. We've eliminated that.\n\nAnd what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make. I wasn't going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; I wasn't going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class. Everything had to be cut.\n\nBut that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11.\n\nTAPPER: Now, that shared sacrifice -- I mean, is that not a tax increase, even if it's a -- I mean, if you're -- if you're taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, that's a tax increase, isn't it?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, I don't -- I don't see it that way. And in addition, what we did was we're giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this July by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that we're going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.\n\nTAPPER: OK, there's been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as you've been wielding your budget ax. Here's one example from a recent town hall meeting.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You're not compensating me for my education and you're not compensating me for my experience. That's...\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, you know what? Then you don't have to do it.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Teachers do it because they love it. That's the only reason I do it.\n\nCHRISTIE: That's good. Well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: I know you said your issue is with teachers' unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers' unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you don't really respect the teaching profession.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I do respect the teaching profession. I'm a product of the public schools in the state of New Jersey, and I care deeply about our public education.\n\nBut here's what we can't have any longer: We can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.\n\nFor instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent. They're getting no raises. They're getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers' unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in New Jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day they're hired until the day they die.\n\nNow, I have to tell you, Jake, we can't have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone who's being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession. By the way, you pay for this special treatment.\n\nI mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and it's direct, but candidly, that's what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in New Jersey and around the country.\n\nTAPPER: You're -- you've been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style. Here's an example of that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRISTIE: Like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and I'm going to say things directly. When you ask me questions, I'm going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in New Jersey is going to have to wonder where I am on an issue.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: That's a high bar, so let's do it. Directly, straightly, bluntly, should New Jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the Obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?\n\nCHRISTIE: I have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit? Because with limited resources in New Jersey, I'm not going to throw good money after bad. And, secondly, what's the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of New Jersey? When I get answers back from them, I'll make a decision.\n\nTAPPER: What's your impulse?\n\nCHRISTIE: I don't have an impulse. I'm waiting to get briefed on it.\n\nTAPPER: Immigration reform. You've said this issue is too important to demagogue. Who is demagoguing in the Senate right now? And what is the solution to immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, first of all, on demagoguing, I wasn't talking about anything that's going on now. That's a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in New Jersey at the time while I was U.S. attorney that I thought was demagoguery, and I called it that.\n\nListen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally. As a former United States attorney, I had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didn't have the resources to deal with them effectively.\n\nSo the president and the Congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.\n\nAnd until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesn't have the resources to do it effectively.\n\nTAPPER: Is the Republican Party in Congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think it depends on which Republican you're talking about. I don't think the party has had a generalized stance. I think there's been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue. And, candidly, I don't think there's one general Republican position.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there are Democrats offering a bill, and they can't -- they can't get any Republicans to join them.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus. And I think that's what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and I think that's the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.\n\nThat's what I've been doing in New Jersey, Jake. We have a Democratic legislature. I've passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a Democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a Democratic legislature, pension reforms with a Democratic legislature.\n\nIf you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and it's on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.\n\nTAPPER: Two more quick questions. One, the stimulus bill. Net positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: I think short-term positive, and we're now feeling the negative.\n\nTAPPER: Lastly, I know you like to talk about New Jersey's cultural icons. You prefer to talk about Springsteen, but the New York Times today has this profile of Snooki from \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\nCHRISTIE: Sure.\n\nTAPPER: MTV's \"Jersey Shore,\" positive for New Jersey or negative?\n\nCHRISTIE: Negative for New Jersey, I mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of New Yorkers, who are -- most of the people on \"Jersey Shore\" are New Yorkers -- takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them at the Jersey shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey.\n\nI could tell people, they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time. The Jersey shore is a beautiful place, and it's a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer. We've got another six weeks or so of summer left. Come to New Jersey.\n\nTAPPER: Governor Christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.\n\nCHRISTIE: Thank you, Jake.\n\nTAPPER: The roundtable is next with Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Donna Brazile, and Stephen Hayes. And later, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO'REILLY: Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately.\n\nSHERROD: I was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.\n\n(UNKNOWN): The full speech has been released by the NAACP, and it backs up Ms. Sherrod's version.\n\nTAPPER: Apparently she's watching this briefing, Shirley Sherrod, on CNN right now. Is there anything you want to say to her?\n\nGIBBS: On behalf of the administration, I offer our apologies.\n\nVILSACK: I asked for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.\n\n(UNKNOWN): He jumped the gun.\n\nSHERROD: To have people think that I was a racist really, really hurt.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: L'affaire Sherrod, one of the many topics we'll talk about on our roundtable today with Stephen Hayes from the Weekly Standard and Fox News Channel, Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist and our dear friend, and ABC News' own Sam Donaldson, and, of course, Cokie Roberts.\n\nThanks, all of you, for being here.\n\nWe'll get to Sherrod in a second, but first I just want to talk a little bit about the Geithner interview. Secretary Geithner said he hopes there isn't going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier Americans. Is there going to be a fight?\n\nHAYES: Yes, hope will only take you so far. I think there will be a fight, and I think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate Democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.\n\nI think you're going to see moderate Democrats who walk back from the administration's eagerness to see this tax hike on what they're calling the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTAPPER: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: The 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. I think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package. Don't call it Bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, it's paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.\n\nTAPPER: Sam, where do you think this is going?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as Secretary Geithner said. And as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them. It really won't. They're going to have something to eat the next day.\n\nBut here's my proposal. There is a point...\n\nTAPPER: A proposal from Sam Donaldson.\n\nDONALDSON: Here's my proposal.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I like that.\n\nDONALDSON: There is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger. When our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes. Then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.\n\nROBERTS: Triggers never work. We've put in triggers -- Congress puts in triggers all the time. It's basically fig leaves, and then they don't -- they don't ever do it.\n\nDONALDSON: The reason it doesn't work, Cokie, is that Congress doesn't follow through.\n\nROBERTS: That's my point.\n\nDONALDSON: I don't think there's a chance that Republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... look, it's obviously not just an economic question. It's a political question. And -- and who gets to frame it? Do the Democrats get to say the Republicans claim that they're against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those Wall Street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the Republicans say, look, here are Democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of American life?\n\nAnd I think that's a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.\n\nTAPPER: And this debate comes as Ben Bernanke, the Fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.\n\nROBERTS: Including the market. I mean, he said those words and 200 points down.\n\nDONALDSON: The market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but Europe has produced better numbers just this past week. The earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, Caterpillar, some of the people who make things. I think we're going to come out of it.\n\nHAYES: But the numbers are mixed. I mean, that's the rosy scenario.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: The numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction. I think if you look at the big picture, the question I think facing -- facing sort of everybody in Washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with Tim Geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans won't have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.\n\nI think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what Tim Geithner just said, and one of those people is Christina Romer in the White House, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Of tax increases.\n\nHAYES: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current American Economic Review, June 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.\n\nROBERTS: Now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...\n\nDONALDSON: There is none.\n\nROBERTS: Well, there isn't one at the moment.\n\nTAPPER: There's not right now. And the heirs of George Steinbrenner are happy for that.\n\nROBERTS: Exactly. So then if they bring it back, they'd better do it overnight, you know, so that people aren't doing in their parents in anticipation.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, you wanted to say something?\n\nBRAZILE: Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate.\n\nSo I think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.\n\nROBERTS: But, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number. I mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about. And -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.\n\nAnd that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: There are two commissions...\n\nROBERTS: ... political problem.\n\nDONALDSON: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, we're going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we don't start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.\n\nROBERTS: Well...\n\nTAPPER: It's not just unnecessary expenses. Some of them are necessary expenses. It's Medicare and Social Security.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the Defense Department says is unnecessary?\n\nROBERTS: Well, you know perfectly well, Sam, that that doesn't save you any money. I mean, you start...\n\nDONALDSON: Oh, a few billion.\n\nROBERTS: You could close down this Capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and you'd still have a deficit because of Social Security, Medicare...\n\nDONALDSON: That's defense spending.\n\nROBERTS: ... and interest on the national debt.\n\nBRAZILE: And the loss of revenues. I mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy. We're not collecting money, so we need to...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: Particularly on capital gains.\n\nBRAZILE: That's right.\n\nHAYES: Which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth. And raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, I think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.\n\nAnd, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea. You've heard administration officials articulate this before, and it's behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: So sign on to the idea that now it's a bad idea, but at some point we're going to come out of this recession.\n\nTAPPER: Well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... and now they raised them, OK?\n\nTAPPER: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the Bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...\n\nROBERTS: Well, that's what you were saying.\n\nTAPPER: ... or not, but Geithner said no.\n\nDONALDSON: But a trigger. Otherwise the Congress will never come back and say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.\n\nBRAZILE: I'm going to be like the Republicans for 30 seconds. How do we pay for it? How do we pay for it? We know that the Bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: It is -- it is part of it, but that's on static scoring. If you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that you'll make up some of the revenues...\n\nBRAZILE: So how many jobs were created during its period when we had the Bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008? How many jobs?\n\nHAYES: I don't -- I don't know the number.\n\nBRAZILE: Hardly any. We lost jobs. That's the point. The point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth. Bottom line, it's about jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nROBERTS: I think that's right. The question is, what cuts? And not just \"cuts.\" And I think that...\n\nHAYES: Sure, OK. Let's say that small business is the engine for job growth.\n\nBRAZILE: I agree with that.\n\nHAYES: But the people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners. So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can...\n\nDONALDSON: Most of the wealthy...\n\nHAYES: ... put people back to work, that's who you're talking about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... most of the wealthy, the top 3 percent are small-business owners? Wrong. There are some, yes, of course.\n\nBRAZILE: It's less than a quarter.\n\nDONALDSON: Come on, Stephen.\n\nTAPPER: We can have PolitiFact come in and weigh in on that one.\n\nBRAZILE: They will. Trust me.\n\nTAPPER: I do want -- I do want to move to the subject of the unemployed. And by the unemployed, I mean Shirley Sherrod, who is the most notable unemployed person in America right now. The White House says they had nothing to do with it, but Shirley Sherrod on CNN, after speaking to President Obama, said she wasn't so sure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I firmly believe that someone in the White House was telling them that the White House wanted me to resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: Now, Donna, the White House says, no, this was all Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's call. Do you believe that?\n\nBRAZILE: They've told me the same story, and...\n\nTAPPER: That's not what I asked you.\n\nBRAZILE: I know.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThey told me the same story, and I'm reluctant -- and I trust the source. My source said we had nothing to do with it, but, you know, once we got on top of it, we moved it.\n\nLook, Ms. Sherrod told a story that is just as amazing as the hymns from \"Amazing Grace.\" It was a story of redemption. And yet we all know from the facts that everyone, everyone -- there's enough pro (ph) to go around to ensure that everyone continue to eat bird until turkey season.\n\nBut the truth is, is that the White House jumped the gun, Fox News and others who allowed this -- this -- this bogus tape to hit the airwaves...\n\nROBERTS: NAACP.\n\nBRAZILE: ... and the NAACP...\n\nTAPPER: The NAACP, absolutely.\n\nBRAZILE: ... that did not call their local chapter, did not confer with Ms. Sherrod, it's a mind-boggling story. I talked to Ms. Sherrod. You know, when you grow up in the deep South, as I did, you know the -- you know the history of the movement and you know the history of the Sherrod family. You know Shirley Sherrod's personal story. I'm ashamed that so many people failed to even just simply Google her name.\n\nROBERTS: But the truth is, the only people who could fire her were the administration. Fox News couldn't fire her. The NAACP couldn't fire her. Only the administration could fire her. So they really bear the most culpability here, I think by a long shot.\n\nBut the other thing that's true is that what she actually did say gets us right back to the last conversation, because what she did say was that the divisions she came to understand were really not between black and white, but between haves and have-nots. And that is really what -- what turned her around and -- and made her fight for that white farmer.\n\nDONALDSON: But I think, except for her, there's enough blame to go around for everyone here. The people who maliciously and with intention misrepresented the facts, I mean, I -- I believe in the First Amendment. There's nothing you can do about them, although you wish for Joseph Welch to say as he did to Joe McCarthy when Joe McCarthy was destroying someone on television, have you no decency, at last?\n\nBut from the standpoint of Obama and the administration, who are these people that they should pay attention to and be afraid of? Who's Glenn Beck? I mean, who's Bill O'Reilly? Who's Brett whatever his name is?\n\nTAPPER: Andrew -- Andrew Breitbart...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: No, let me -- let me finish, because I want to give a little advice, since I've been doing it this morning in economics, to the president.\n\n(UNKNOWN): OK.\n\nDONALDSON: I want to quote another president who also said he had enemies, I'm going to -- of financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sexism. They are unanimous in their hatred for me, and I welcome their hatred, said Franklin Roosevelt, who said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\n\nSo, President Obama, don't be afraid of them. Take them on, and let the people judge. You may lose, but if you lose, you will lose grandly (ph).\n\nTAPPER: This is an argument you hear from a lot of liberal activists and Democratic activists. Josh Marshall, who writes at Talking Points Memo, wrote, speaking of Andrew Breitbart, who -- the blogger, the conservative blogger who originally posted this video, that -- the unfairly edited excerpt, which he says that's the -- that's the way he got it, was in that unfairly edited excerpt, and this is what Josh Marshall wrote.\n\n\"Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify. To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong.\"\n\nStephen, do you think that this -- that liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists or...\n\nHAYES: No, way. They would never do that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean, Donna's colleague, Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this. Senior vice president of news, Michael Clemente, sent out a memo talking about the need to treat this carefully, to gather all the facts.\n\nLook, it's an easy distraction. That's what they want to do. I understand that.\n\nThe basic point, to go back to what Donna said, involves the speech, and the speech was -- you know, for -- for most of the speech, a fantastic speech, a compelling speech, a moving speech. I mean, to hear the stories about Baker County, to hear about her upbringing, to hear about the men who burned crosses in her front yard, is a compelling story. It's incredibly moving.\n\nWhat happened then in the speech was that she slipped into what I think are easy accusations of racism that don't work. She said, in the -- in the middle of her speech...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: This is the speech in March, the March speech, yes.\n\nHAYES: ... the March speech, she talked about Republicans. It's always about money, she said. I haven't seen such mean-spirited people as I've seen lately over the issue of health care. Some of the racism we thought was buried, didn't it surface? Now we've endured eight years of the Bushes, and we didn't do some of the stuff these Republicans are doing because you have a black president.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Bill O'Reilly called for her to be fired. Isn't (ph) he on Fox...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: So did the White House. So did the USDA.\n\nROBERTS: But there was racism that came up during the health care debate, with the -- with the vilification of John Lewis at the Capitol. And -- and the truth is, is that -- you know, this is a conversation we -- we just don't have.\n\nI mean, I really think Eric Holder was right. We are cowardly about talking about race.\n\nI had a cross burned in my front yard, too, and I know what it was like to grow up in the South in those years. And -- and the truth is that the -- that the conversation is just different among whites and among blacks. It is. And we have to be able to address that if we're ever going to get past it as a nation.\n\nIf we have any opportunity to perfect this union, that's what we have to do.\n\nHAYES: I agree with you, but don't you think one of the reasons that we don't have this kind of conversation about race is because of the kind of comments branding Republicans as racists for opposing health care?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: This has -- this has nothing to do...\n\nDONALDSON: Mr. Beck called the president of the United States a racist. What about that?\n\nTAPPER: But is that racist, to say somebody's racist?\n\nDONALDSON: Well, he just said branding people as racists.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: What she was -- what she was saying -- I heard the speech in its entirety, and I went public when I heard the speech. What she was talking about was the political climate, a political climate that, yes, some in the Republican Party have condoned simply because they refuse to repudiate those elements within their party that simply have gone too far, with the birther notion, with his illegitimacy, and creating the kind of racial resentment that prohibits us from having a genuine conversation about race and racism.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, Shirley Sherrod on CNN also said something specifically about Andrew Breitbart from biggovernment.com, the conservative activist who posted the unfairly edited video, and here's what she had to say.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSHERROD: I know I've gotten black versus white. He's probably the person who's never gotten past it and never attempted to get past it. I think he'd like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery. That's where I think he'd like to see all black people end up again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: This woman's been offered a job by the Agriculture Department as a deputy director of the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and she's saying Andrew Breitbart wants to return to the days of slavery.\n\nNow, you can think what Andrew Breitbart did was reprehensible, irresponsible, unfair, and a total smear. Did that justify saying he wants us to go back to the days of slavery?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- to second-guess Ms. Sherrod. I know her history. But I am going to say that Mr. Breitbart should resign, even after -- not resign...\n\nROBERTS: From what?\n\nBRAZILE: Sorry, I misspoke. I'm not in the business of asking people to be fired. I've been fired once before. But I think Mr. Breitbart should apologize to her.\n\nI mean, she -- this is a woman who -- her father was murdered, and no one was ever brought to justice. I mean, she has some -- she has some anger that she was talking about, but she also talked about how she got -- you know, how she came to struggle with this and how she went on to -- to -- to start her life anew and fight for farmers of (inaudible)\n\nBut let me just say, going back to this conversation, can we have a conversation about race? Yes. But it cannot start here in Washington. It cannot start with politicians leading the conversation. It must start back in Georgia, where Ms. Sherrod and the Spooners can help lead us in this dialogue.\n\nAnd if Mr. Breitbart would like to be part of it, we welcome him to the conversation.\n\nROBERTS: But it's -- I disagree. I think it can start in Washington, and I think it can start in the White House. And I think that we -- that we have an opportunity -- everybody talks about this being a teachable moment. Well, let's learn and -- and let's have the president be the teacher in -- in chief. And, you know...\n\nDONALDSON: Yes. And Mitch McConnell was asked about an aspect of this, and he says, I don't want to get into that. All right. That's his privilege not to as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate. But it takes all the sides to get into it civilly, not calling names or calling people racists on either side -- you're quite correct -- and talk about it. But it's not going to happen, unfortunately.\n\nBRAZILE: But civil rights used to be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nROBERTS: That's right.\n\nBRAZILE: It wasn't black or white or left versus white. It was Republicans. I keep telling Republicans, it was Republicans who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBERTS: ... listen to the Johnson tapes, when Johnson was ready to sign the civil rights bill, it was, you know, dead of summer, and -- and he's saying to his aides, make sure that the Republicans are here. I'm not going to sign this without Ev Dirksen being in the room, because this is the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: Well, Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader...\n\nROBERTS: ... they -- they had so much to do with it.\n\nDONALDSON: Ev Dirksen, the Republican leader of the Senate, made the last speech in favor of breaking the southern filibuster to pass the '64 Civil Rights Act. He quoted Victor Hugo. Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. That's the way the Republicans in the Senate acted.\n\nBRAZILE: But I hope Ms. Sherrod and Mr. Breitbart can sit down and have a -- whatever kind of summit.\n\n(UNKNOWN): A beer summit?\n\nBRAZILE: I don't know what she drinks.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALDSON: ... don't want to get into this.\n\nBRAZILE: But I know that they can find a common language to talk about the future if they can only sit and listen to each other.\n\nTAPPER: Donna, I want to ask you a question about -- Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times suggests that she should -- Shirley Sherrod should be offered a job in the White House. And she also writes this: \"The first black president should expand beyond his campaign security blanket, the smug cordon of overprotective white guys surrounding him. Otherwise, this administration will keep tripping over race, rather than inspiring on race. The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give here a new job, director of black outreach. This White House needs one.\"\n\nWhether or not the job should go to Shirley Sherrod, does this White House need one?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, I would hope that the White House could bring in more people, people who understood history, people who could help serve this president. When they hear of a conversation like Ms. Sherrod, hopefully they won't run to the hilltop. They could sit down and say let's -- let's talk about this.\n\nI -- I know from having talked to Valerie Jarrett that she's deeply concerned and that she's working inside the White House to make sure that this never happens again.\n\nDONALDSON: But, Jake, it's not black outreach. Maureen, please, it's outreach on this issue for blacks and whites and people of all colors.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Of all colors.\n\nDONALDSON: To say, all right, we need someone for black outreach is the wrong direction.\n\nTAPPER: Stephen?\n\nHAYES: Well, yes, I mean, I don't think -- I think that Sam's right. I don't think that necessarily creating a new position of black outreach is -- is going to solve the country's problems on race. And certainly after looking at Ms. Sherrod, in spite of her history and the things that she said that were so moving, after seeing her comments about Andrew Breitbart wanting us to go back to slavery, would not be the ideal person for the job.\n\nTAPPER: Cokie, 30 seconds.\n\nROBERTS: Well, no, I think that the basic point that there has been an ignorance in some ways of -- of the immediate past history that some of us lived through of the young people in the White House is true and that -- and that there does need to be a better understanding of that in order to -- to just try to -- to salve the wounds.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Wonderful job, guys. Thank you so much. The roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com and on our new iPad app, where later you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with PolitiFact to fact-check the show."}

Mr. Gibbs said they would put in place a \u201cstricter regulatory structure\u201d to prevent breakdowns in food-safety inspections.\n\nPart of the review is sure to examine whether the requirement for the peanut company\u2019s approval caused delays in warnings about its products once public health officials became aware of significant problems at its plant in Blakely, Ga.

The peanut company announced a limited recall on Jan. 13 and expanded it on Jan. 16. The company waited until Jan. 28 before recalling all products made at the plant in 2007 and 2008, even though it had known since 2007 that tests of products showed contamination with salmonella.\n\nFood buyers and some top public health officials say they knew before any public announcement that the company\u2019s products and those of its customers were the likeliest source of the outbreak.\n\nCraig Wilson, an assistant vice president at Costco, said he pulled Kellogg\u2019s Keebler and Austin peanut butter crackers off shelves a day before Kellogg\u2019s first announcement and nearly a week before the Peanut company and Kellogg issued a nationwide recall that covered those cookies.\n\nMr. Wilson said he could not wait for the F.D.A. to make announcements about food problems that are widely known among food safety officials.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that you can\u2019t rely on the F.D.A.,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, \u201cbut we certainly can move quicker than they do.\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. can seize a product that it suspects is contaminated, and it can ask a federal judge for authority to recall products if a maker refuses to do so.

He is killing it at Apostolic Church of God in Chicago tonight!", "article": "Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Apostolic Church of God\n\nChicago, IL | June 15, 2008\n\nGood morning. It's good to be home on this Father's Day with my girls, and it's an honor to spend some time with all of you today in the house of our Lord.\n\nAt the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus closes by saying, \u201cWhoever hears these words of mine, and does them, shall be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.\u201d [Matthew 7: 24-25]\n\nHere at Apostolic, you are blessed to worship in a house that has been founded on the rock of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. But it is also built on another rock, another foundation \u2013 and that rock is Bishop Arthur Brazier. In forty-eight years, he has built this congregation from just a few hundred to more than 20,000 strong \u2013 a congregation that, because of his leadership, has braved the fierce winds and heavy rains of violence and poverty; joblessness and hopelessness. Because of his work and his ministry, there are more graduates and fewer gang members in the neighborhoods surrounding this church. There are more homes and fewer homeless. There is more community and less chaos because Bishop Brazier continued the march for justice that he began by Dr. King's side all those years ago. He is the reason this house has stood tall for half a century. And on this Father's Day, it must make him proud to know that the man now charged with keeping its foundation strong is his son and your new pastor, Reverend Byron Brazier.\n\nOf all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important. And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation. They are teachers and coaches. They are mentors and role models. They are examples of success and the men who constantly push us toward it.\n\nBut if we are honest with ourselves, we'll admit that what too many fathers also are is missing \u2013 missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it.\n\nYou and I know how true this is in the African-American community. We know that more than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled \u2013 doubled \u2013 since we were children. We know the statistics \u2013 that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it.\n\nHow many times in the last year has this city lost a child at the hands of another child? How many times have our hearts stopped in the middle of the night with the sound of a gunshot or a siren? How many teenagers have we seen hanging around on street corners when they should be sitting in a classroom? How many are sitting in prison when they should be working, or at least looking for a job? How many in this generation are we willing to lose to poverty or violence or addiction? How many?\n\nYes, we need more cops on the street. Yes, we need fewer guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. Yes, we need more money for our schools, and more outstanding teachers in the classroom, and more afterschool programs for our children. Yes, we need more jobs and more job training and more opportunity in our communities.\n\nBut we also need families to raise our children. We need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception. We need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child \u2013 it's the courage to raise one.\n\nWe need to help all the mothers out there who are raising these kids by themselves; the mothers who drop them off at school, go to work, pick up them up in the afternoon, work another shift, get dinner, make lunches, pay the bills, fix the house, and all the other things it takes both parents to do. So many of these women are doing a heroic job, but they need support. They need another parent. Their children need another parent. That's what keeps their foundation strong. It's what keeps the foundation of our country strong.\n\nI know what it means to have an absent father, although my circumstances weren't as tough as they are for many young people today. Even though my father left us when I was two years old, and I only knew him from the letters he wrote and the stories that my family told, I was luckier than most. I grew up in Hawaii, and had two wonderful grandparents from Kansas who poured everything they had into helping my mother raise my sister and me \u2013 who worked with her to teach us about love and respect and the obligations we have to one another. I screwed up more often than I should've, but I got plenty of second chances. And even though we didn't have a lot of money, scholarships gave me the opportunity to go to some of the best schools in the country. A lot of kids don't get these chances today. There is no margin for error in their lives. So my own story is different in that way.\n\nStill, I know the toll that being a single parent took on my mother \u2013 how she struggled at times to the pay bills; to give us the things that other kids had; to play all the roles that both parents are supposed to play. And I know the toll it took on me. So I resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle \u2013 that if I could be anything in life, I would be a good father to my girls; that if I could give them anything, I would give them that rock \u2013 that foundation \u2013 on which to build their lives. And that would be the greatest gift I could offer.\n\nI say this knowing that I have been an imperfect father \u2013 knowing that I have made mistakes and will continue to make more; wishing that I could be home for my girls and my wife more than I am right now. I say this knowing all of these things because even as we are imperfect, even as we face difficult circumstances, there are still certain lessons we must strive to live and learn as fathers \u2013 whether we are black or white; rich or poor; from the South Side or the wealthiest suburb.\n\nThe first is setting an example of excellence for our children \u2013 because if we want to set high expectations for them, we've got to set high expectations for ourselves. It's great if you have a job; it's even better if you have a college degree. It's a wonderful thing if you are married and living in a home with your children, but don't just sit in the house and watch \u201cSportsCenter\u201d all weekend long. That's why so many children are growing up in front of the television. As fathers and parents, we've got to spend more time with them, and help them with their homework, and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in awhile. That's how we build that foundation.\n\nWe know that education is everything to our children's future. We know that they will no longer just compete for good jobs with children from Indiana, but children from India and China and all over the world. We know the work and the studying and the level of education that requires.\n\nYou know, sometimes I'll go to an eighth-grade graduation and there's all that pomp and circumstance and gowns and flowers. And I think to myself, it's just eighth grade. To really compete, they need to graduate high school, and then they need to graduate college, and they probably need a graduate degree too. An eighth-grade education doesn't cut it today. Let's give them a handshake and tell them to get their butts back in the library!\n\nIt's up to us \u2013 as fathers and parents \u2013 to instill this ethic of excellence in our children. It's up to us to say to our daughters, don't ever let images on TV tell you what you are worth, because I expect you to dream without limit and reach for those goals. It's up to us to tell our sons, those songs on the radio may glorify violence, but in my house we live glory to achievement, self respect, and hard work. It's up to us to set these high expectations. And that means meeting those expectations ourselves. That means setting examples of excellence in our own lives.\n\nThe second thing we need to do as fathers is pass along the value of empathy to our children. Not sympathy, but empathy \u2013 the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes; to look at the world through their eyes. Sometimes it's so easy to get caught up in \u201cus,\u201d that we forget about our obligations to one another. There's a culture in our society that says remembering these obligations is somehow soft \u2013 that we can't show weakness, and so therefore we can't show kindness.\n\nBut our young boys and girls see that. They see when you are ignoring or mistreating your wife. They see when you are inconsiderate at home; or when you are distant; or when you are thinking only of yourself. And so it's no surprise when we see that behavior in our schools or on our streets. That's why we pass on the values of empathy and kindness to our children by living them. We need to show our kids that you're not strong by putting other people down \u2013 you're strong by lifting them up. That's our responsibility as fathers.\n\nAnd by the way \u2013 it's a responsibility that also extends to Washington. Because if fathers are doing their part; if they're taking our responsibilities seriously to be there for their children, and set high expectations for them, and instill in them a sense of excellence and empathy, then our government should meet them halfway.\n\nWe should be making it easier for fathers who make responsible choices and harder for those who avoid them. We should get rid of the financial penalties we impose on married couples right now, and start making sure that every dime of child support goes directly to helping children instead of some bureaucrat. We should reward fathers who pay that child support with job training and job opportunities and a larger Earned Income Tax Credit that can help them pay the bills. We should expand programs where registered nurses visit expectant and new mothers and help them learn how to care for themselves before the baby is born and what to do after \u2013 programs that have helped increase father involvement, women's employment, and children's readiness for school. We should help these new families care for their children by expanding maternity and paternity leave, and we should guarantee every worker more paid sick leave so they can stay home to take care of their child without losing their income.\n\nWe should take all of these steps to build a strong foundation for our children. But we should also know that even if we do; even if we meet our obligations as fathers and parents; even if Washington does its part too, we will still face difficult challenges in our lives. There will still be days of struggle and heartache. The rains will still come and the winds will still blow.\n\nAnd that is why the final lesson we must learn as fathers is also the greatest gift we can pass on to our children \u2013 and that is the gift of hope.\n\nI'm not talking about an idle hope that's little more than blind optimism or willful ignorance of the problems we face. I'm talking about hope as that spirit inside us that insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, that something better is waiting for us if we're willing to work for it and fight for it. If we are willing to believe.\n\nI was answering questions at a town hall meeting in Wisconsin the other day and a young man raised his hand, and I figured he'd ask about college tuition or energy or maybe the war in Iraq. But instead he looked at me very seriously and he asked, \u201cWhat does life mean to you?\u201d\n\nNow, I have to admit that I wasn't quite prepared for that one. I think I stammered for a little bit, but then I stopped and gave it some thought, and I said this:\n\nWhen I was a young man, I thought life was all about me \u2013 how do I make my way in the world, and how do I become successful and how do I get the things that I want.\n\nBut now, my life revolves around my two little girls. And what I think about is what kind of world I'm leaving them. Are they living in a county where there's a huge gap between a few who are wealthy and a whole bunch of people who are struggling every day? Are they living in a county that is still divided by race? A country where, because they're girls, they don't have as much opportunity as boys do? Are they living in a country where we are hated around the world because we don't cooperate effectively with other nations? Are they living a world that is in grave danger because of what we've done to its climate?\n\nAnd what I've realized is that life doesn't count for much unless you're willing to do your small part to leave our children \u2013 all of our children \u2013 a better world. Even if it's difficult. Even if the work seems great. Even if we don't get very far in our lifetime.\n\nThat is our ultimate responsibility as fathers and parents. We try. We hope. We do what we can to build our house upon the sturdiest rock. And when the winds come, and the rains fall, and they beat upon that house, we keep faith that our Father will be there to guide us, and watch over us, and protect us, and lead His children through the darkest of storms into light of a better day. That is my prayer for all of us on this Father's Day, and that is my hope for this country in the years ahead. May God Bless you and your children. Thank you."}

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\n\nWe rate this claim True."}

We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.\n\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\n\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.\n\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\n\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\n\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\n\nTRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\n\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\n\nYou say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\n\nBut I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\n\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\n\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\n\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\n\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\n\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\n\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\n\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.\n\nWe\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\n\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\n\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\n\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\n\nCLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.\n\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\n\nI\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\n\nTRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?\n\nRADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.\n\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\n\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\n\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\n\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\n\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\n\nCLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\n\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\n\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\n\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\n\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\n\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: In the first debate\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.\n\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nTRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\n\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\n\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\n\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\n\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\n\nCLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\n\nCLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.\n\nCLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.\n\nCLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.\n\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\n\nCLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\n\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\n\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.\n\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We brought up the e-mails.\n\nTRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.\n\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\n\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\n\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\n\nBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\n\nNumber three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\n\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\n\nRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\n\nObamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\n\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\n\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\n\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time\u2026\n\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\n\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\n\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\n\nTRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.\n\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\n\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nAnd she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\n\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\n\nCLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.\n\nIt\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\n\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\n\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..\n\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026 TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\n\nRADDATZ: I do.\n\nTRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?\n\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\n\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\n\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\n\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: So, please\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\n\nTRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.\n\nRADDATZ: She did not.\n\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\n\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.\n\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\n\nBut, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.

And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nCLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 with the Russians and other foreign powers.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.\n\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.\n\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\n\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\n\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.\n\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.\n\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\n\nBut \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\n\nWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\n\nBut we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\n\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\n\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\n\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\n\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nCLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\n\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\n\nCOOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\n\nTRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.\n\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.\n\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.\n\nCOOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\n\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.\n\nHey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nCOOPER: In the past\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.\n\nTRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.\n\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.\n\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\n\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\n\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\n\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\n\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\n\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which\u2026\n\nCLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were\u2026\n\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\n\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\n\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\n\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\n\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\n\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\n\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\n\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\n\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\n\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\n\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\n\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\n\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country?\n\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\n\nTRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.\n\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\n\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\n\nNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\n\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.\n\nI do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Everything.\n\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\n\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.\n\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.\n\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\n\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\n\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\n\nTRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.\n\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.\n\nLet me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\n\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\n\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\n\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\n\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\n\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?\n\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\n\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you.\n\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\n\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\n\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\n\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\n\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\n\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens\u2026\n\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.\n\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\n\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to\u2026\n\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.\n\nCLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another\u2026 TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.\n\nTRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\n\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\n\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\n\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\n\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\n\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\n\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\n\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\n\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.\n\nSo I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.\n\nI ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\n\nIt\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.\n\nCLINTON: Well\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.\n\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\n\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\n\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\n\nI will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\n\nYou take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\n\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\n\nYou know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\n\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\n\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We have\u2026\n\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\n\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\n\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\n\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\n\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone."}

At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,\" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. \"But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.\"\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation \u2014 sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) \u2014 to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.\"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\"The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.\"When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It's time for it to be increased again.\""}

(Applause.) It is good to be back. It\u2019s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.\n\n\n\nI want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who\u2019s here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nI see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he\u2019s got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they\u2019ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn\u2019t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.\n\n\n\nDick Durbin couldn\u2019t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He\u2019s doing a great job. And we\u2019ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we\u2019re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd all of you are here, and it\u2019s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn\u2019t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn\u2019t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.\n\n\n\nAnd on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what\u2019s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nSee, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.\n\n\n\nIn the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.\n\n\n\nBut over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.\n\n\n\nAnd so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people\u2019s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\n\n\n\nAnd towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.\n\n\n\nNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we\u2019re off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.\n\n\n\nAnd because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda\u2019s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they\u2019re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they\u2019re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We\u2019re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.\n\n\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.\n\n\n\nBut -- and here's the big \u201cbut\u201d -- I\u2019m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who\u2019ve been out of work for some time.\n\n\n\nToday, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven\u2019t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they\u2019re going to be able to retire.\n\n\n\nSo in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.\n\n\n\nThis growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why reversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It\u2019s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn\u2019t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we\u2019ve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.\n\n\n\nThen, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don\u2019t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks who\u2019ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAlmost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.\n\n\n\nThen, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.\n\n\n\nBut you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won\u2019t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they\u2019ll shift the topic to \u201cout-of-control government spending\u201d \u2013- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nOr they\u2019ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they\u2019ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who\u2019ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they\u2019ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we've been fighting for.\n\n\n\nBut with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.\n\n\n\nThis moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That\u2019s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That\u2019s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need to be talking about. That\u2019s what Washington needs to be focused on.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That\u2019s what we need. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need right now. That\u2019s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, some of these ideas I\u2019ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, of course, we\u2019ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We\u2019ve got to standing up for civil rights. We\u2019ve got to stand up for women\u2019s rights. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo all those issues are important, and we\u2019ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don\u2019t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won\u2019t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won\u2019t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.\n\n\n\nNow, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what\u2019s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\u2019ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can\u2019t act on my own and Congress isn\u2019t cooperating, I\u2019ll pick up the phone -- I\u2019ll call CEOs; I\u2019ll call philanthropists; I\u2019ll call college presidents; I\u2019ll call labor leaders. I\u2019ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future, for all Americans.\n\nSo let me give you a quick preview of what I\u2019ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.\n\n\n\nNow, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I\u2019m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe want to make sure that -- we\u2019re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I\u2019m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let\u2019s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there\u2019s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let\u2019s put some folks to work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we\u2019ve got work to do all across the country. We\u2019ve got ports that aren\u2019t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years\u2019 time. If we don\u2019t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We\u2019ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nBusinesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can\u2019t be outsourced. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, this isn\u2019t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that\u2019s inefficient at a time when it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s been since the 1950s to build things. It\u2019s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nThe longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They\u2019ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we\u2019ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIn an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they\u2019ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they\u2019ll reward those folks with good pay.\n\n\n\nThe days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn\u2019t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they\u2019re not going away. Those old days aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\n\nSo we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That\u2019s what we have to do. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they\u2019re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t make this investment, we\u2019re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don\u2019t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America\u2019s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We\u2019re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn\u2019t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to challenge CEOs from some of America\u2019s best companies to hire more Americans who\u2019ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 an honest look.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that\u2019s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that\u2019s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn\u2019t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That\u2019s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we\u2019re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo this is all a good start -- but it isn\u2019t enough. Families and taxpayers can\u2019t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We\u2019ll never have enough loan money, we\u2019ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We\u2019ve got to get more out of what we pay for.\n\n\n\nNow, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they\u2019re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.\n\n\n\nSo this afternoon, I\u2019ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who\u2019s willing to work for it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, so you\u2019ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that\u2019s your biggest asset. For most families, that\u2019s where your life\u2019s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we\u2019ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn\u2019t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.\n\n\n\nSo already, I\u2019ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney\u2019s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We\u2019ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that\u2019s rock-solid for future generations.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It\u2019s getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.\n\n\n\nNow, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don\u2019t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nGood job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.\n\n\n\nFifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you\u2019ve worked a lifetime to build.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if you\u2019re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don\u2019t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you\u2019d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who\u2019ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act does. That\u2019s what it does. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don\u2019t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don\u2019t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that\u2019s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.\n\n\n\nSo just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today -- 50 percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who\u2019ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you\u2019ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nFinally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I\u2019m going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we\u2019ve never guaranteed success -- that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. That's the American idea. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that\u2019s a betrayal of the American idea. And that\u2019s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.\n\n\n\nThe best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life\u2019s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we\u2019ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\nSo good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that's where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.\n\n\n\nThese are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won\u2019t be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We\u2019ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I\u2019ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I\u2019m going to highlight the ones that do just that.\n\n\n\nThere are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it\u2019s not just good for the employees, it\u2019s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It\u2019s good for America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to be willing to -- we\u2019ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just -- Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we\u2019ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we\u2019ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you\u2019ve said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won\u2019t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I\u2019ll be proposing. I know because they\u2019ve said so. But they worry they\u2019ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.\n\n\n\nNow, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they\u2019re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.\n\n\n\nIn either case, I say to these members of Congress: I\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You can't just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEven if you think I\u2019ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it\u2019s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you\u2019re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s go. If you\u2019ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let\u2019s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you\u2019re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I\u2019m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don\u2019t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we\u2019re older and wiser. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wiser, but I\u2019m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn\u2019t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don\u2019t shut down the government just because I\u2019m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don\u2019t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we\u2019ve already racked up, something that we\u2019ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don\u2019t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, that\u2019s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money\u2019s power will distort our politics even more.\n\n\n\nSocial tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn\u2019t improving. And the fundamental optimism that\u2019s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the vision I have for this country. It\u2019s not the vision you have for this country. That\u2019s not the America we know. That\u2019s not the vision we should be settling for. That\u2019s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.\n\n\n\nI have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019ll tell you, Galesburg, that\u2019s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that\u2019s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we\u2019re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\u2019ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven\u2019t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWhen we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for \u201cnumber one.\u201d Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That\u2019s why we don\u2019t call it John\u2019s dream or Susie\u2019s dream or Barack\u2019s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that\u2019s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we're fighting for.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that\u2019s not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters.\n\n\n\nOne of America\u2019s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, \u201cI speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, America, we\u2019ve made it through the worst of yesterday\u2019s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.\n\n\n\nSo thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEND\n\n1:17 P.M. CDT"}

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nFor weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city\u2019s newest luxury hotels.\n\nBut that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project \u2014 billionaire developer Donald Trump \u2014 put himself at the center of the nation\u2019s debate over illegal immigration.\n\n[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]\n\nTrump garnered headlines \u2014 and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him \u2014 when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and \u201crapists\u201d crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.\n\nBut a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump\u2019s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs \u2014 while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.\n\nSince Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)\n\nAll of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something ironic,\u201d said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,\u201d Arellano said in Spanish. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.\u201d\n\nInterviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.\n\nSeveral of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cMost of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,\u201d said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country\u2019s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.\n\n\u201cHe might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,\u201d Gonzalez said of Trump.\n\n1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation\u2019s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country\u2019s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nSeveral of the laborers \u2014 who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day \u2014 fumed at Trump\u2019s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.\n\n\u201cDo you think that when we\u2019re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we\u2019re raping or selling drugs?\u201d Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. \u201cWe\u2019re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site\u2019s several hundred workers.\n\n\u201cOur contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,\u201d the \u00ade-mailed statement said.\n\nLend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, \u201crequires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMichael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,\u201d Cohen said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees\u2019 status is accurate.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.\n\nHicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about illegal immigration \u2014 which included a promise to \u201cbuild a great, great wall on our southern border\u201d and bill Mexico for the cost \u2014 reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company\u2019s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.\n\nThe rapid rejection of Trump\u2019s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country \u2014 and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe NBC television network, the Macy\u2019s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump \u2014 part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.\n\nOn Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to \u201cdump Trump\u201d by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump\u2019s hotel.\n\n\n\n[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to \u2018dump Trump\u2019]\n\nAt the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump\u2019s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel\u2019s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.\n\nThe site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington \u2014 with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building\u2019s heyday as the District\u2019s main post office in the early 20th century.\n\nTrucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.\n\nArms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.\n\nAhmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. \u201cMost of the workers here are migrants,\u201d he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, what he said. They\u2019re hard workers.\u201d\n\nFor David Montoya, 28, Trump\u2019s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. \u201cEvery 18 months, I have to get it renewed,\u201d he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.\n\nMontoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story \u2014 one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off \u2014 is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he reflected, \u201cwe\u2019re more American than him.\u201d"}

The piece was published today in Newsweek.\n\nPresident Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX\n\nBy President Obama\n\nCoaching my daughter Sasha\u2019s basketball team is one of those times when I just get to be \u201cDad.\u201d I snag rebounds, run drills, and have a little fun. More importantly, I get to watch Sasha and her teammates improve together, start thinking like a team, and develop self-confidence.\n\nAny parent knows there are few things more fulfilling than watching your child discover a passion for something. And as a parent, you\u2019ll do anything to make sure he or she grows up believing she can take that ambition as far as she wants; that your child will embrace that quintessentially American idea that she can go as far as her talents will take her.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t so long ago that something like pursuing varsity sports was an unlikely dream for young women in America. Their teams often made do with second-rate facilities, hand-me-down uniforms, and next to no funding.\n\nWhat changed? Well, 40 years ago, committed women from around the country, driven by everyone who said they couldn\u2019t do something, worked with Congress to ban gender discrimination in our public schools. Title IX was the result of their efforts, and this week, we celebrated its 40th anniversary\u201440 years of ensuring equal education, in and out of the classroom, regardless of gender.\n\nI was reminded of this milestone last month, when I awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt. When she started out as a basketball coach, Pat drove the team van to away games. She washed the uniforms in her own washing machine. One night she and her team even camped out in an opponent\u2019s gym because they had no funding for a hotel. But she and her players kept their chins up and their heads in the game. And in 38 years at the University of Tennessee, Pat won eight national championships and tallied more than 1,000 wins\u2014the most by any college coach, man or woman. More important, every single woman who ever played for Pat has either graduated or is on her way to a degree.\n\nToday, thanks in no small part to the confidence and determination they developed through competitive sports and the work ethic they learned with their teammates, girls who play sports are more likely to excel in school. In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men. This is a great accomplishment\u2014not just for one sport or one college or even just for women but for America. And this is what Title IX is all about.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, Title IX isn\u2019t just about sports. From addressing inequality in math and science education to preventing sexual assault on campus to fairly funding athletic programs, Title IX ensures equality for our young people in every aspect of their education. It\u2019s a springboard for success: it\u2019s thanks in part to legislation like Title IX that more women graduate from college prepared to work in a much broader range of fields, including engineering and technology. I\u2019ve said that women will shape the destiny of this country, and I mean it. The more confident, empowered women who enter our boardrooms and courtrooms, legislatures, and hospitals, the stronger we become as a country.\n\nAnd that is what we are seeing today. Women are not just taking a seat at the table or sitting at the head of it, they are creating success on their own terms. The women who grew up with Title IX now pioneer scientific breakthroughs, run thriving businesses, govern states, and, yes, coach varsity teams. Because they do, today\u2019s young women grow up hearing fewer voices that tell them \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d and more voices that tell them \u201cYou can.\u201d\n\nWe have come so far. But there\u2019s so much farther we can go. There are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make. As president, I\u2019ll do my part to keep Title IX strong and vibrant, and maintain our schools as doorways of opportunity so every child has a fair shot at success. And as a dad, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure that this country remains the place where, no matter who you are or what you look like, you can make it if you try."}

Trump on the Stakes of the Election\n\nDownload PDF\n\nToday I\u2018d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.\n\nPeople have asked me why I am running for President.\n\nI have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.\n\nWe come to work together and turn visions into reality.\n\nWe think big, and then we make it happen.\n\nI love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.\n\nSo when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.\n\nWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton \u2013 only by me.\n\nThe fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!\n\nEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\u2019t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\n\nWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking Bernie Sanders\u2019 voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not just the political system that\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s the whole economy.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged against you, the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar \u2013\n\njust look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]\n\nBrian Williams\u2019 career was destroyed for saying far less.\n\nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.\n\nI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\n\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\n\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.\n\nHere is my promise to the American voter:\n\nIf I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests \u2013 and taking money from special interests.\n\nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\n\nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund \u2013 doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.\n\nThen, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests \u2013 in less than 2 years \u2013 secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]\n\nTogether, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]\n\nThey totally own her, and that will never change.\n\nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.\n\nThose are the stakes.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.\n\nShe believes she is entitled to the office.\n\nHer campaign slogan is \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d\n\nYou know what my response to that is? I\u2019m with you : the American people.\n\nShe thinks it\u2019s all about her.\n\nI know it\u2019s all about you \u2013 I know it\u2019s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.\n\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\n\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism \u2013 focusing on what\u2019s good for America\u2019s middle class \u2013 to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\n\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\n\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\n\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\n\nThat\u2019s what we mean by America First.\n\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\n\nOur Founders understood this.\n\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \u201cthe encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\u201d in America.[5]\n\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:\n\n\u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d[6]\n\nI have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]\n\nWe\u2019ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]\n\nOur trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]\n\nThen she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property \u2013 a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]\n\nHillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.\n\nIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!\n\nThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\u2019s expense.\n\nShe gets rich making you poor.\n\nHere is a quote from the book: \u201cAt the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton\u2026at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\u201d\n\nThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]\n\nShe sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.\n\nHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas \u2013 and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]\n\nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book \u2013 deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]\n\nBut this latest Clinton cover-up doesn\u2019t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2013 and it will be even worse than the Clintons\u2019 NAFTA deal.\n\nI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.\n\nWe don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.\n\nIt\u2019s not just our economy that\u2019s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars \u2013 and unleashed ISIS across the world.\n\nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\n\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.\n\nAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.\n\nAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department refused them all.\n\nShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.\n\nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]\n\nHere is what one of the victim\u2019s mothers had to say:\n\n\u201cI want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don\u2019t want this person to be president.\u201d[16]\n\nIn 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.\n\nLibya was cooperating.\n\nIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\n\nSyria was under control.\n\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\n\nEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.\n\nISIS wasn\u2019t even on the map.\n\nFast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed\n\nto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.\n\nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.\n\nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen \u2013 while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]\n\nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora\u2019s box of radical Islam.\n\nThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]\n\nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.\n\nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality \u2013 and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\n\nIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.\n\nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]\n\nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]\n\nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn\u2019t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.\n\nShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.\n\nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:\n\n\u201cShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve\n\nin the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true\u2026Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive\u2026disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d[21]\n\nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.\n\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.[22]\n\nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth \u2013 with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]\n\nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]\n\nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]\n\nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.\n\nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]\n\nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\n\nHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:\n\nA foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29]\n\nHillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access \u2013 even though he had no national security credentials.[30]\n\nHillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State \u2013 plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31]\n\nHillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32]\n\nHillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33]\n\nTo cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.\n\nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments \u2013 perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China \u2013 putting all of America in danger.[34]\n\nThen there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]\n\nWhile we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.\n\nSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.\n\nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.\n\nWe can\u2019t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNational security is also immigration security \u2013 and Hillary wants neither.\n\nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.\n\nShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]\n\nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.\n\nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.\n\nShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]\n\nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\u2019s letter:\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms\u2019 way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\u201d\n\nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.\n\nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\n\nHillary\u2019s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can\u2019t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\n\nHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:\n\nAppoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.\n\nChange immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs\n\nStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many\n\nCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas\n\nLift restrictions on energy production\n\nRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.\n\nPass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.\n\nImpose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.\n\nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nThis is why the stakes in November are so great.\n\nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.\n\nThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don\u2019t need or want another Clinton or Obama.\n\nCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.\n\nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s message is old and tired. Her message is that can\u2019t change.\n\nMy message is that things have to change \u2013 and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.\n\nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.\n\nThen we started thinking small.\n\nWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.\n\nWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.\n\nBut that\u2019s not who we are.\n\nCome this November, we can bring America back \u2013 bigger and better, and stronger than ever.\n\nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth \u2013 the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.\n\nOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment \u2013 we will bring it back all the way.\n\nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country \u2013 breathing life and hope into our communities.\n\nInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.\n\nConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.\n\nThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary\u2019s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.\n\nWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.\n\nI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.\n\nOur country is going to start working again.\n\nPeople are going to start working again.\n\nParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again \u2013 including parents in our inner cities.\n\nAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.\n\nWe are going to make America rich again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nWe are going to make America Great Again \u2013 and Great Again For EVERYONE .\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] (\u201cSen.

We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain\u2014but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.\n\nClick here to tell us how many people you can pass it on to\u2014and to see our progress nationally:\n\nhttp://pol.moveon.org/mccain10/\n\n10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't):\n\nJohn McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now he says his position has \"evolved,\" yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws.1 According to Bloomberg News, McCain is more hawkish than Bush on Iraq, Russia and China. Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3\n\nMcCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0\u2014yes, zero\u2014from the League of Conservation Voters last year.10\n\nJohn McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

You have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time.Let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague, Haleh Esfandiari, and her family. I have made my position known to the Iranian government. It is time for Haleh to be released. It is time for Haleh to come home.Thanks to the 9/11 Commission, we know that six years ago this week President Bush received a briefing with the headline: \"Bin Ladin determined to strike in U.S.\"It came during what the Commission called the \"summer of threat,\" when the \"system was blinking red\" about an impending attack. But despite the briefing, many felt the danger was overseas, a threat to embassies and military installations. The extremism, the resentment, the terrorist training camps, and the killers were in the dark corners of the world, far away from the American homeland.Then, one bright and beautiful Tuesday morning, they were here.I was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown Chicago when I heard the news on my car radio: a plane had hit the World Trade Center. By the time I got to my meeting, the second plane had hit, and we were told to evacuate.People gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the Sears Tower, transformed from a workplace to a target. We feared for our families and our country. We mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens. Back at my law office, I watched the images from New York: a plane vanishing into glass and steel; men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go; tall towers crumbling to dust. It seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud, blocking out the September sun.What we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats, we are no longer protected by our own power. And what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation.The history of America is one of tragedy turned into triumph. And so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free. An attack on Pearl Harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the Atlantic and Pacific. An Iron Curtain was punctured by democratic values, new institutions at home, and strong international partnerships abroad.After 9/11, our calling was to write a new chapter in the American story. To devise new strategies and build new alliances, to secure our homeland and safeguard our values, and to serve a just cause abroad. We were ready. Americans were united. Friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us. We had the might and moral-suasion that was the legacy of generations of Americans. The tide of history seemed poised to turn, once again, toward hope.But then everything changed.We did not finish the job against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy, or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists' base of support. We did not reaffirm our basic values, or secure our homeland.Instead, we got a color-coded politics of fear. Patriotism as the possession of one political party. The diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries. A rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st century's stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state. A deliberate strategy to misrepresent 9/11 to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11.And so, a little more than a year after that bright September day, I was in the streets of Chicago again, this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in Iraq. I did not oppose all wars, I said. I was a strong supporter of the war in Afghanistan. But I said I could not support \"a dumb war, a rash war\" in Iraq. I worried about a \" U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences\" in the heart of the Muslim world. I pleaded that we \"finish the fight with bin Ladin and al Qaeda.\"The political winds were blowing in a different direction. The President was determined to go to war. There was just one obstacle: the U.S. Congress. Nine days after I spoke, that obstacle was removed. Congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the President the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day. With that vote, Congress became co-author of a catastrophic war. And we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create, and no plan for how to get out.Because of a war in Iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11.According to the National Intelligence Estimate, the threat to our homeland from al Qaeda is \"persistent and evolving.\" Iraq is a training ground for terror, torn apart by civil war. Afghanistan is more violent than it has been since 2001. Al Qaeda has a sanctuary in Pakistan. Israel is besieged by emboldened enemies, talking openly of its destruction. Iran is now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the United States in the Middle East in a generation. Groups affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda operate worldwide. Six years after 9/11, we are again in the midst of a \"summer of threat,\" with bin Ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in the United States.What's more, in the dark halls of Abu Ghraib and the detention cells of Guantanamo, we have compromised our most precious values. What could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power. A tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us.It is time to turn the page. It is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11.Just because the President misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them. The terrorists are at war with us. The threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, but the threat is real. They distort Islam. They kill man, woman and child; Christian and Hindu, Jew and Muslim. They seek to create a repressive caliphate. To defeat this enemy, we must understand who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for.The President would have us believe that every bomb in Baghdad is part of al Qaeda's war against us, not an Iraqi civil war. He elevates al Qaeda in Iraq -- which didn't exist before our invasion -- and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits in Pakistan. He lumps together groups with very different goals: al Qaeda and Iran, Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents. He confuses our mission.And worse -- he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight. Bin Ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas. But they can provoke the reaction we've seen in Iraq: a misguided invasion of a Muslim country that sparks new insurgencies, ties down our military, busts our budgets, increases the pool of terrorist recruits, alienates America, gives democracy a bad name, and prompts the American people to question our engagement in the world.By refusing to end the war in Iraq, President Bush is giving the terrorists what they really want, and what the Congress voted to give them in 2002: a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.It is time to turn the page. When I am President, we will wage the war that has to be won, with a comprehensive strategy with five elements: getting out of Iraq and on to the right battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan; developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world's most deadly weapons; engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism; restoring our values; and securing a more resilient homeland.The first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in Iraq, and taking the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan.I introduced a plan in January that would have already started bringing our troops out of Iraq, with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31, 2008. If the President continues to veto this plan, then ending this war will be my first priority when I take office.There is no military solution in Iraq. Only Iraq's leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of Iraq's civil war. We must apply pressure on them to act, and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence. And we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability.In ending the war, we must act with more wisdom than we started it. That is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al Qaeda within Iraq. But we must recognize that al Qaeda is not the primary source of violence in Iraq, and has little support -- not from Shia and Kurds who al Qaeda has targeted, or Sunni tribes hostile to foreigners. On the contrary, al Qaeda's appeal within Iraq is enhanced by our troop presence.Ending the war will help isolate al Qaeda and give Iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out. It will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to Afghanistan. Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need\u00e2\u0080\u0094and deserve. As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country.As President, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counter-terrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban. As we step up our commitment, our European friends must do the same, and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered NATO's efforts. We must also put more of an Afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the Afghan Army and Police, and including Afghan soldiers in U.S. and NATO operations.We must not, however, repeat the mistakes of Iraq. The solution in Afghanistan is not just military -- it is political and economic. As President, I would increase our non-military aid by $1 billion. These resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary Afghans, including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers. And we must seek better performance from the Afghan government, and support that performance through tough anti-corruption safeguards on aid, and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country.Above all, I will send a clear message: we will not repeat the mistake of the past, when we turned our back on Afghanistan following Soviet withdrawal. As 9/11 showed us, the security of Afghanistan and America is shared. And today, that security is most threatened by the al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwest Pakistan.Al Qaeda terrorists train, travel, and maintain global communications in this safe-haven. The Taliban pursues a hit and run strategy, striking in Afghanistan, then skulking across the border to safety.This is the wild frontier of our globalized world. There are wind-swept deserts and cave-dotted mountains. There are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map, and governments as forces that come and go. There are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience, and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence. It's a tough place.But that is no excuse. There must be no safe-haven for terrorists who threaten America. We cannot fail to act because action is hard.As President, I would make the hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Pakistan conditional, and I would make our conditions clear: Pakistan must make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.And Pakistan needs more than F-16s to combat extremism. As the Pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas, my Administration will increase America's commitment. We must help Pakistan invest in the provinces along the Afghan border, so that the extremists' program of hate is met with one of hope. And we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair -- our goal is not simply an ally in Pakistan, it is a democratic ally.Beyond Pakistan, there is a core of terrorists -- probably in the tens of thousands -- who have made their choice to attack America. So the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down, capture or kill terrorists around the world, and to deny them the world's most dangerous weapons.I will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to America. This requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the Army and Marine Corps's new counter-insurgency manual. I will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists. We need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same. This must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages, understand different cultures, and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies.To succeed, we must improve our civilian capacity. The finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. But it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions -- sometimes in dangerous places. As President, I will strengthen these civilian capacities, recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge. I will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts, and other civilians who can work alongside our military. We can't just say there is no military solution to these problems. We need to integrate all aspects of American might.One component of this integrated approach will be new Mobile Development Teams that bring together personnel from the State Department, the Pentagon, and USAID. These teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples' lives, and to turn the tide against extremism. Where people are most vulnerable, where the light of hope has grown dark, and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity -- that is where these teams will go.I will also strengthen our intelligence. This is about more than an organizational chart. We need leadership that forces our agencies to share information, and leadership that never -- ever -- twists the facts to support bad policies. But we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information, and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks.This cannot just be an American mission. Al Qaeda and its allies operate in nearly 100 countries. The United States cannot steal every secret, penetrate every cell, act on every tip, or track down every terrorist -- nor should we have to do this alone. This is not just about our security. It is about the common security of all the world.As President, I will create a Shared Security Partnership Program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands of Indonesia, to the sprawling cities of Africa. This program will provide $5 billion over three years for counter-terrorism cooperation with countries around the world, including information sharing, funding for training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and targeting terrorist financing. And this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics, because brutality breeds terror, it does not defeat it.We must also do more to safeguard the world's most dangerous weapons. We know al Qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon. We know they would not hesitate to use one. Yet there is still about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium, some of it poorly secured, at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries. There are still about 15,000 to 16,00 nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across 11 time zones in the former Soviet Union.That is why I worked in the Senate with Dick Lugar to pass a law that would help the United States and our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction. That is why I am introducing a bill with Chuck Hagel that seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And that is why, as President, I will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years. While we work to secure existing stockpiles, we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material.And I won't hesitate to use the power of American diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror. The lesson of the Bush years is that not talking does not work. Go down the list of countries we've ignored and see how successful that strategy has been. We haven't talked to Iran, and they continue to build their nuclear program. We haven't talked to Syria, and they continue support for terror. We tried not talking to North Korea, and they now have enough material for 6 to 8 more nuclear weapons.It's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action. It's time to turn the page on Washington's conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that Presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear.President Kennedy said it best: \"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\" Only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them. As President, I will work with our friend and allies, but I won't outsource our diplomacy in Tehran to the Europeans, or our diplomacy in Pyongyang to the Chinese. I will do the careful preparation needed, and let these countries know where America stands. They will no longer have the excuse of American intransigence. They will have our terms: no support for terror and no nuclear weapons.But America must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons, or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill. That is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism.When you travel to the world's trouble spots as a United States Senator, much of what you see is from a helicopter. So you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camp in Darfur, the flood near Djibouti, the bombed out block in Baghdad. You see thousands of desperate faces.Al Qaeda's new recruits come from Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world. And it makes you stop and wonder: when those faces look up at an American helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?We know where extremists thrive. In conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy. In weak states that cannot control their borders or territory, or meet the basic needs of their people. From Africa to central Asia to the Pacific Rim -- nearly 60 countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse. The extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate-filled websites.And we know what the extremists say about us. America is just an occupying Army in Muslim lands, the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at Abu Ghraib, the power behind the throne of a repressive leader. They say we are at war with Islam. That is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame -- blame America, blame progress, blame Jews. And often he offers something along with the hate. A sense of empowerment. Maybe an education at a madrasa, some charity for your family, some basic services in the neighborhood. And then: a mission and a gun.We know we are not who they say we are. America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil. We are not at war with Islam. America is a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people. The vast majority of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims have no use for bin Ladin or his bankrupt ideas. But too often since 9/11, the extremists have defined us, not the other way around.When I am President, that will change. We will author our own story.We do need to stand for democracy. And I will. But democracy is about more than a ballot box. America must show -- through deeds as well as words -- that we stand with those who seek a better life. That child looking up at the helicopter must see America and feel hope.As President, I will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate. Freedom must mean freedom from fear, not the freedom of anarchy. I will never shrug my shoulders and say -- as Secretary Rumsfeld did -- \"Freedom is untidy.\" I will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems, honest police forces, and financial systems that are transparent and accountable. Freedom must also mean freedom from want, not freedom lost to an empty stomach. So I will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy.I will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to $50 billion by 2012. And I will support a $2 billion Global Education Fund to counter the radical madrasas -- often funded by money from within Saudi Arabia -- that have filled young minds with messages of hate. We must work for a world where every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy. And as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in Europe and Asia as well -- more support for our diplomacy, more support for multilateral peacekeeping, and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict.I will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my Administration, not a small group of political officials at the State Department explaining a misguided war. We will open \"America Houses\" in cities across the Islamic world, with Internet, libraries, English lessons, stories of America's Muslims and the strength they add to our country, and vocational programs. Through a new \" America's Voice Corps\" we will recruit, train, and send out into the field talented young Americans who can speak with -- and listen to -- the people who today hear about us only from our enemies.As President, I will lead this effort. In the first 100 days of my Administration, I will travel to a major Islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle. I will make clear that we are not at war with Islam, that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future, and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence. I will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter, and my message will be clear: \"You matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\"This brings me to the fourth step in my strategy: I will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over.Major General Paul Eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country. It included training the Iraqi Army. After Abu Ghraib, his senior Iraqi advisor came into his office and said: \"You have no idea how this will play out on the streets of Baghdad and the rest of the Arab world. How can this be?\" This was not the America he had looked up to.As the counter-insurgency manual reminds us, we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side. But because the Administration decided to take the low road, our troops have more enemies. Because the Administration cast aside international norms that reflect American values, we are less able to promote our values. When I am President, America will reject torture without exception. America is the country that stood against that kind of behavior, and we will do so again.I also will reject a legal framework that does not work. There has been only one conviction at Guantanamo. It was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism. The sentence was 9 months. There has not been one conviction of a terrorist act. I have faith in America's courts, and I have faith in our JAGs. As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Our Constitution and our Uniform Code of Military Justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists.This Administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand. I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.That means no more illegal wire-tapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are. And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists. The FISA court works. The separation of powers works. Our Constitution works. We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers, and that justice is not arbitrary.This Administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security. It is not. There are no short-cuts to protecting America, and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland.Too often this Administration's approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices, or to scare Americans without telling them what to be scared of, or what to do. A Department set up to make Americans feel safer didn't even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in New Orleans. That's not acceptable.My Administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk. I will establish a Quadrennial Review at the Department of Homeland Security -- just like at the Pentagon -- to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them. And I will develop a comprehensive National Infrastructure Protection Plan that draws on both local know-how and national priorities.We have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable. That means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants. Improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports. And making sure our energy sector -- our refineries and pipelines and power grids -- is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy.We also have to get past a top-down approach. Folks across America are the ones on the front lines. On 9/11, it was citizens -- empowered by their knowledge of the World Trade Center attacks -- who protected our government by heroically taking action on Flight 93 to keep it from reaching our nation's capital. When I have information that can empower Americans, I will share it with them.Information sharing with state and local governments must be a two-way street, because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together -- the tip from Afghanistan, and the cop who sees something suspicious on Michigan Avenue. I will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government. I will address the problem in our prisons, where the most disaffected and disconnected Americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al Qaeda and its ideological allies.And my Administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires, or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes. We've been through that on 9/11. We've been through it during Katrina. I will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when American lives are at stake.But this effort can't just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform. It can't just be about how we spend our time or our money.It's about the kind of country we are.We are in the early stages of a long struggle. Yet since 9/11, we've heard a lot about what America can't do or shouldn't do or won't even try. We can't vote against a misguided war in Iraq because that would make us look weak, or talk to other countries because that would be a reward. We can't reach out to the hundreds of millions of Muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us. We can't protect the homeland because there are too many targets, or secure our people while staying true to our values. We can't get past the America of Red and Blue, the politics of who's up and who's down.That is not the America that I know.The America I know is the last, best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter. It's the country that put a man on the moon; that defeated fascism and helped rebuild Europe. It's a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies, but rather by the power of our ideals, and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home.That's the America I know. We just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the American story. If we do, we can keep America safe while extending security and opportunity around the world. We can hold true to our values, and in doing so advance those values abroad. And we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be: the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny, and the light of hope to the world.To make this story reality, it's going to take Americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country. It's going to take the service of a new generation of young people. It's going to take facing tragedy head-on and turning it into the next generation's triumph. That is a challenge that I welcome. Because when we do make that change, we'll do more than win a war -- we'll live up to that calling to make America, and the world, safer, freer, and more hopeful than we found it.As prepared for delivery"}

Over the course of the year, 39 states enacted 141 provisions related to reproductive health and rights. Half of these new provisions, 70 in 22 states, sought to restrict access to abortion services. In sharp contrast to this barrage of abortion restrictions, a handful of states adopted measures designed to expand access to reproductive health services. Most notably, California enacted the first new state law in more than seven years designed to expand access to abortion, and five states adopted measures to expand access to comprehensive sex education, facilitate access to emergency contraception for women who have been sexually assaulted and enable patients\u2019 partners to obtain STI treatment.\n\nAbortion\n\nTwenty-two states enacted 70 abortion restrictions during 2013. This makes 2013 second only to 2011 in the number of new abortion restrictions enacted in a single year. To put recent trends in even sharper relief, 205 abortion restrictions were enacted over the past three years (2011\u20132013), but just 189 were enacted during the entire previous decade (2001\u20132010).\n\nForty-five percent of the abortion restrictions enacted over the last three years fall into four categories: targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP), limitations on insurance coverage of abortion, bans on abortions at 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period) and limitations on medication abortion. States enacted 93 measures in these four categories from 2011 through 2013, compared with 22 during the previous decade.\n\nThe number of new abortion restrictions ballooned from 43 enacted in 2012 to 70 in 2013. Four states were key to this increase. North Dakota and Texas, which did not have legislative sessions in 2012, together enacted 13 restrictions in 2013. In addition, the 2012 elections brought changes to the legislature in Arkansas and the governor\u2019s mansion in North Carolina that created environments more hostile to abortion; after adopting no abortion restrictions in 2012, these two states together enacted 13 new restrictions in 2013.\n\nThis legislative onslaught has dramatically changed the landscape for women needing abortion. In 2000, the two states that were the most restrictive in the nation, Mississippi and Utah, had five of 10 major types of abortion restrictions in effect (see Appendix). By 2013, however, 22 states had five or more restrictions, and Louisiana had 10.\n\nIn 2000, 13 states had at least four types of major abortion restrictions and so were considered hostile to abortion rights (see Troubling Trend: More States Hostile to Abortion Rights as Middle Ground Shrinks); 27 states fell into this category by 2013. In contrast, the number of states supportive of abortion rights fell from 17 to 13, while the number of middle-ground states was cut in half, from 20 to 10. The proportion of women living in restrictive states went from 31% to 56%, while the proportion living in supportive states fell from 40% to 31% over the same period.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it is particularly noteworthy that California moved to significantly improve access to early abortion services by expanding the types of providers permitted to perform either medication or surgical abortions. Legislation enacted in September allows physician assistants, certified nurse midwives and nurse practitioners to provide abortions during the first trimester. Thirty-nine states limit the provision of abortion services to licensed physicians (see Overview of Abortion Laws). Also this year, Colorado repealed its pre-Roe abortion law. Although these measures are not enforced, 12 states continue to have pre-Roe laws on the books (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).\n\nDespite this progress, the overwhelming preponderance of legislation concerning abortion was aimed at restricting access to the procedure. Four types of restrictions dominated the legislative scene during 2013: abortion bans, restrictions on abortion providers, limitations on the provision of medication abortion and restrictions on coverage of abortion in private health plans. Together, legislation in these four categories accounted for 56% of all restrictions enacted over the year.\n\nBans on Abortion\n\nOvertly flouting the standard established by Roe v. Wade, two states enacted laws banning abortion early in pregnancy. In March, the Arkansas legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Mike Beebe (D) to ban abortions occurring more than 12 weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Later that month, North Dakota enacted a ban on abortions occurring after a fetal heartbeat is detected, something that generally occurs at about six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period. Legal challenges were quickly filed to both measures and enforcement is blocked while litigation proceeds. Additionally, the North Dakota legislature also approved an initiative that will be placed on the November 2014 ballot to ban abortion entirely by defining a person as a \u201chuman being at any stage of development.\u201d Currently, no state has a law in effect prohibiting abortions early in pregnancy (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).\n\nAntiabortion legislators in 11 states introduced measures aimed at banning abortion later in pregnancy based on the spurious belief that a fetus can feel pain at that point of development, and three new laws were enacted in Arkansas, North Dakota and Texas. These laws ban nearly all abortions performed at or beyond 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after the woman\u2019s last menstrual period). All three have gone into effect, bringing to nine the number of states with a 20-week ban in effect (see State Policies on Later Abortions ). (A similar 20-week ban was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in June; although introduced in the Senate late in the year, the measure was not voted on.)\n\nTargeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP)\n\nEight states enacted onerous and irrelevant licensing requirements targeting abortion clinics and providers in 2013. These laws are designed to discourage medical professionals from providing abortion and make it impossible for clinics to remain open (see TRAP Laws Gain Political Traction While Abortion Clinics\u2014and the Women They Serve\u2014Pay the Price). Most often, these restrictions require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, mandate transfer agreements with hospitals or impose onerous structural requirements on clinics.\n\nFour states (Alabama, North Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin) enacted laws that require providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. These measures effectively give hospitals veto power over clinics\u2019 ability to provide services. All four were immediately challenged in court; enforcement of the Alabama, North Dakota and Wisconsin laws was temporarily blocked, but the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for implementation of the Texas requirement as the litigation proceeds. Nine states now have laws requiring abortion providers to have hospital privileges; four are in effect (see State Policies on Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers).\n\nOhio has long required abortion providers to have an agreement with a hospital allowing the transfer of patients needing emergency care. In June, the state adopted a new provision prohibiting public hospitals from entering into these transfer agreements. Including Ohio, nine states require abortion providers to have transfer agreements, measures that do little to add to existing patient safeguards in the event of an emergency.\n\nOver the course of 2013, five states implemented new structural standards for abortion providers. North Carolina and Texas enacted measures requiring abortion clinics to meet essentially the same standards required for comprehensive ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that provide more invasive and risky procedures and use higher levels of anesthesia. Alabama adopted somewhat more limited requirements relating to emergency care and fire safety. Virginia, meanwhile, finalized regulations to implement its 2011 TRAP law. Finally, Indiana, which had already required sites where surgical abortion was performed to adhere to standards similar to those for ASCs, extended these requirements to apply to sites where only medication abortion is performed. Including these new requirements, 26 states now require abortion facilities to essentially meet ASC standards.\n\nMedication Abortion\n\nSeventeen states have adopted restrictions on medication abortion over the last three years\u2014 making it one of the most frequent targets of abortion opponents (see Medication Abortion Restrictions Burden Women and Providers\u2014and Threaten U.S. Trend Toward Very Early Abortion). In 2013 alone, eight states moved to ban the use of telemedicine in administering the medication, despite the fact that telemedicine is rapidly gaining acceptance as a way to expand access to health care. Over the course of the year, seven states (Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas) enacted laws effectively banning the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. In addition, the Iowa Board of Medicine adopted regulations prohibiting the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. Over the course of the year, courts blocked enforcement of the Iowa regulations, as well as earlier laws that had been enacted in North Dakota and Wisconsin. As of December, 14 states have measures in effect blocking the use of telemedicine to provide medication abortion (see State Policies on Medication Abortion).\n\nThe second way states have moved to restrict access to medication abortion is by requiring use of an outdated protocol that mandates a high dose of the medicine (in contrast to a widely used evidence-based protocol that permits a lower dose), prohibits its use after 49 days of pregnancy and requires the woman to make an extra trip to the clinic. In 2013, Texas adopted a variation on this approach by permitting use of the lower dose but retaining the two other limitations. The state joins Ohio in requiring use of the outdated protocol.\n\nFinally, Oklahoma adopted a law in 2010 designed to ban medication abortion entirely. In 2012, the state\u2019s supreme court overturned the law and in November, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case. As a result, the ban is not in effect.\n\nPrivate Insurance Coverage of Abortion\n\nStates adopted three types of restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion. Michigan\u2019s new measure is the most expansive of those enacted in 2013, it prohibits abortion coverage in private health plans except when the woman\u2019s life is endangered. This brings to nine the number of states with restrictions that apply to all private health plans (see State Policies on Restricting Insurance Coverage of Abortion).\n\nThe Michigan provisions also specifically prohibit plans participating in the health exchange from providing coverage beyond situations when the woman\u2019s life is endangered. Three other states (Arkansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) also enacted provisions that greatly restrict abortion coverage in the health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act and only allow coverage in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest. Additional abortion coverage in Arkansas, Michigan and Pennsylvania is available only through the purchase of a separate rider at an additional cost. Including these four states, 24 states have banned abortion coverage in health exchanges.\n\nNorth Carolina enacted a measure prohibiting health plans for county or municipal employees from covering abortion except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest. The Georgia Board of Community Health approved a health plan for state employees that will not cover abortion except in cases of life endangerment. Nineteen states now limit abortion coverage for state employees.\n\nOther Major Abortion Restrictions\n\nStates adopted a wide range of other major abortion restrictions in 2013.\n\nParental Involvement. Three states enacted provisions designed to make it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without parental involvement. Arkansas enacted a measure that makes it a crime to assist a minor in obtaining an abortion without parental consent, even if the procedure is performed in a state where parental involvement is not required. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) allowed a parental consent requirement to go into effect without his signature; enforcement of the law is blocked pending a legal challenge. Oklahoma, which has long required parental consent and notification, adopted a measure that made the process for complying with the law more cumbersome by adding requirements such as documentation from parents proving parenthood. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court cleared the way for the state\u2019s 1995 parental notice law to go into effect, bringing the number of states requiring parental involvement before a minor receives an abortion to 39 (see State Policies on Parental Involvement in Minors\u2019 Abortions).\n\nPublic Funding for Abortion. Iowa continued its policy of paying for abortions only in cases of life endangerment, rape, incest and fetal impairment. However, the state now requires the governor\u2019s office to approve all instances where reimbursement is provided. Most states pay for abortion only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest; Iowa is one of six states with a slightly broader standard see State Policies on State Funding of Abortion Under Medicaid). Seventeen states pay for all or most medically necessary abortions for low-income women (see Insurance Coverage of Abortion: Beyond the Exceptions for Life Endangerment, Rape and Incest).\n\nWaiting Periods. South Dakota effectively extended its 72-hour waiting period by declaring that weekends and holidays could not be counted toward the requirement; this could extend the waiting period to a maximum of six days in some cases, giving the state the most restrictive waiting period requirement of the 26 such requirements in the country (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).\n\nCounseling. Ohio and Kansas expanded their existing counseling requirements. Ohio moved to require providers to test for a fetal heartbeat at least 24 hours before an abortion and inform the woman of the \u201cstatistical probability\u201d of carrying the pregnancy to term if a fetal heartbeat is detected. Kansas enacted a measure requiring that abortion counseling materials include information on fetal pain, the risk of breast cancer and premature birth; the measure also delineates the exact text for written counseling materials (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).\n\nUltrasound. Wisconsin and Indiana both adopted measures that require women to undergo an ultrasound prior to obtaining an abortion and listen to a detailed description of the image; the provider must offer her the option to view the image and listen to the heartbeat. Twenty-two states now regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers (see State Policies on Requirements for Ultrasound).\n\nSex Selection and Genetic Impairment. Kansas, North Carolina and North Dakota enacted provisions criminalizing abortion for the purposes of sex selection. The North Dakota measure also prohibits the provision of an abortion because the fetus has been \u201cdiagnosed with either a genetic abnormality or the potential for a genetic abnormality.\u201d This brings to six the number of states that ban abortion for purposes of sex selection, in line with a recent push by abortion opponents both in the U.S. and internationally (see A Problem-and-Solution Mismatch: Son Preference and Sex-Selective Abortion Bans).\n\nWithholding Information. Kansas and Montana enacted laws that shield medical professionals from liability for withholding information that may have resulted in a woman obtaining an abortion.\n\nState Employees. Kansas enacted a measure prohibiting state employees from participating in or facilitating abortions unless the procedure is performed outside of normal working hours at a facility not funded or operated by the state.\n\nRefusal. A new law adopted in North Carolina allows any health care facility to refuse to provide abortion services; the previous law had allowed only hospitals to refuse. The law also expands the types of medical providers who may refuse to participate in an abortion to include professionals such as pharmacists, counselors and social workers, or their employees; previous law had applied only to physicians and nurses (see Refusing to Provide Health Services).\n\nFamily Planning\n\nTwenty states enacted measures relating to access to family planning services in 2013, including measures that set funding levels, determine the types of providers eligible for funding and affect access to emergency contraception.\n\nFamily Planning Programs\n\nOf the 17 states that passed budgets with line items for family planning funding, only Maine cut funding drastically; following on the heels of a 25% cut in 2012, the state slashed funds by an additional 33% in 2013. In contrast, New Hampshire reversed the 57% cut to family planning funding that had been adopted in 2011, restoring funds to their previous level. A similar attempt to reverse funding cuts in New Jersey came up short when Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed family planning funding for the fifth time.\n\nAlthough family planning funding remained relatively stable in 2013, attempts to restrict family planning providers\u2019 eligibility for state and federal funds continued apace. A new tiered system for determining priority for state and federal family planning funds in Ohio puts family planning providers at the bottom of a long list. A similar system in Oklahoma excludes specialized family planning providers not affiliated with health departments from receiving funds. Colorado, Kansas, Michigan and Texas re-enacted their existing restrictions, although the measure in Kansas is blocked due to a legal challenge. At year\u2019s end 10 states have abortion-related restrictions on family planning providers (see State Family Planning Funding Restrictions).\n\nFederal courts blocked measures enacted in Arizona and Indiana that would have excluded family planning providers who have any association with abortion services from being able to participate in the massive Medicaid program, citing that Medicaid patients have the right to seek treatment from the Medicaid provider of their choice (see Besieged Family Planning Network Plays Pivotal Role).\n\nThese injunctions cleared the way for abortion providers in Arizona and Indiana to be reimbursed for the family planning services they provide to Medicaid enrollees. In sharp contrast, Texas abolished its longstanding and successful federal-state family planning expansion after being told by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services that it was impermissible for the state to exclude providers who had some association with abortion. The state replaced it with a much smaller and entirely state-funded program (see State Medicaid Family Planning Eligibility Expansions).\n\nEmergency Contraception\n\nHawaii enacted a new law requiring that a woman who has been sexually assaulted receive medically accurate and unbiased information on emergency contraception from the hospital treating her injuries. The law also requires the hospital to dispense the medication when requested by the woman. Hawaii is the 18th state to provide protections to women who have been sexually assaulted (see Emergency Contraception).\n\nHowever, two states moved to restrict access to emergency contraception. In May, Oklahoma enacted a measure that would have required a minor younger than 17 to obtain a prescription to access the medication, despite the fact that the federal Food and Drug Administration ruled that minors of any age may obtain emergency contraception without a prescription; in August, a state court temporarily blocked enforcement of the measure. Also in 2013, Missouri passed a measure prohibiting the state from requiring pharmacies to carry prescription or nonprescription drugs or devices, including contraceptives, such as emergency contraception.\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\n\nIn 2013, Hawaii, Nebraska and Vermont expanded access to treatment for STIs. Hawaii and Nebraska enacted provisions allowing health care practitioners to prescribe or dispense prescriptions for gonorrhea or chlamydia to a patient\u2019s partner without first seeing the partner. Vermont, which had had a law allowing partner treatment for some STIs, enacted a new law expanding the conditions for which partner treatment is permitted. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit treatment of a patient\u2019s partner (see Partner Treatment for STIs).\n\nSex Education\n\nTwo states enacted measures to expand access to sex education in 2013. A new law in Colorado effectively prohibits abstinence-only instruction by requiring sex education in the state to be scientifically proven to delay sexual debut, reduce adolescents\u2019 number of sexual partners, reduce the frequency of sex, and increase their contraceptive use. Illinois enacted three separate laws related to sex education. Although school districts can still decide for themselves whether to provide sex education, the new law requires any sex education that is taught in the state to be medically accurate and age-appropriate and include instruction on contraception and abstinence. The package also requires health education, which is mandatory for all school districts, to contain medically accurate information on abstinence as well as age-appropriate instruction on teen dating violence and child sexual abuse prevention. These new laws bring to nine the number of states requiring that the sex education provided in the state be medically accurate and include information on contraception (see State Policies in Brief: Sex and HIV Education.)\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, new laws in North Carolina and Kansas could limit access to comprehensive and medically accurate sex education. A new law enacted in Kansas prohibits an individual who is associated in any way with an abortion provider from providing sex education. Meanwhile, a new law in North Carolina requires that sex education in the state must inform students that having an abortion increases the risk of a subsequent preterm birth. In Montana, Gov. Bullock (D) vetoed a measure that would have required parental consent for students participating in sex education.\n\nFetal Issues\n\nThree states enacted laws regarding assault on pregnant women or fetal homicide. Arkansas adopted a measure allowing a fetus to be considered a victim of homicide at any point in gestation; a similar measure was allowed to go into effect in Montana without the governor\u2019s signature. Instead of considering a fetus an independent victim, Colorado amended its statute criminalizing assault on a pregnant woman to include penalties for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry.\n\nPregnancy\n\nTennessee enacted a law requiring publicly funded substance abuse facilities to give preference to pregnant women, there are now 10 states that require facilities give pregnant women priority access (see Substance Abuse During Pregnancy). It also prohibits the state from filing for protective services for a newborn if a woman who is less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy seeks substance abuse treatment as part of prenatal care. (A similar bill in New Mexico was effectively vetoed when Gov. Susana Martinez (R) took no action on it.) Finally, the budget adopted in Indiana allocated $250,000 for \u201cprenatal substance use and prevention.\u201d\n\nAPPENDIX: STATES BY HOSTILITY TO ABORTION RIGHTS, 2000 AND 2013"}

What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It\u2019s very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I\u2019m going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, he\u2019s not a free-trader\u201d, which I am, I\u2019m absolutely a free-trader. I\u2019m for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a free-trader,\u201d at 10%. But if I say we\u2019re putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It\u2019s really sort of an amazing thing.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I\u2019m not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don\u2019t know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we\u2019re not going to lose any more. And so it\u2019s very, very unfair.\n\nTrump on Trumponomics:Nationalism plus flexibility\n\nLeader:The impulsiveness and shallowness of America\u2019s president threaten the economy as well as the rule of law\n\nBriefing 1:Donald Trump\u2019s economic strategy\n\nBriefing 2:The contradiction at the heart of Trumponomics\n\nBriefing 3:What Donald Trump means by fair trade\n\nNow at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it\u2019s gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to\u2026they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. \u201cWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, it is. Absolutely.\u201d So, so we did that and we\u2019ll start.\n\nWe have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I\u2019ve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It\u2019s called a cooling-off period, OK? But that\u2019s not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don\u2019t want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven\u2019t given me approval. And the reason they haven\u2019t is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn\u2019t go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He\u2019ll be in sometime, I guess next week?\n\nSteve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.\n\nPresident Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, \u201cCan we negotiate?\u201d I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don\u2019t know what a hundred days is going to be like. What\u2019s it going to be like? So NAFTA\u2019s a horrible one-sided deal that\u2019s cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nBig isn\u2019t a good enough word. Massive.\n\nHuge?\n\nIt\u2019s got to be. It\u2019s got to be.\n\nWhat would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nNo, it\u2019s gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.\n\nWhat would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nI was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn\u2019t like\u2026this wasn\u2019t a game I was playing. I\u2019m not playing\u2026you know, I wasn\u2019t playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I\u2019d never even thought about\u2026it\u2019s always the best when you really feel this way. But I was\u2026I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that\u2019s fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would\u2019ve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nBut Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?\n\nWe have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70\u2014almost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they\u2019ve been negotiating for 35 years. And it\u2019s been\u2026it\u2019s been terrible for the United States. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just been terrible. They\u2019ve never been able to make it.\n\nDoes that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?\n\nNot necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I\u2019m not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn\u2019t have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?\n\nNo, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that\u2019s bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, \u201cWhen do we start this negotiation?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who\u2019s our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d So it\u2019s a real deficit. Now that\u2019s a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it\u2019s up for renegotiation and we\u2019ve informed them that we\u2019ll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don\u2019t want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.\n\nSome people think this is a negotiating tactic\u2014that you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, really not a negotiation. It\u2019s really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn\u2019t? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it\u2019s very short [laughter], you know when I\u2019m with [Xi Jinping], because he\u2019s great, when I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, \u201cWe have a problem and we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201d But he wants to help us solve that problem.\n\nNow then you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, \u201cDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator\u201d. Now I have to understand something. I\u2019m dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no\u2026because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he\u2019s a great guy.\n\nNow, with that in mind, he\u2019s representing China and he wants what\u2019s best for China. But so far, you know, he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been very good. But, so they talk about why haven\u2019t you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, \u201cJinping. Please help us, let\u2019s make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we\u2019re announcing tomorrow that you\u2019re a currency manipulator, OK?\u201d They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn\u2019t call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they\u2019re actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I\u2019ve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.\n\nOne last question on trade. Do you think you\u2019ve permanently changed the Republican Party\u2019s position on trade?\n\nNo. Because there\u2019ll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it\u2019s not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn\u2019t two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn\u2019t meet that time limit they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it there\u201d, well, they shouldn\u2019t have set a time limit.\n\nOn another element of Trumponomics, immigration\u2026\n\nRight.\n\nDo you want to curb legal immigration?\n\nOh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.\n\nAnd what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?\n\nOh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they\u2019re very strong, they\u2019re very good, I like them very much. We\u2019re going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting\u2026not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.\n\nBut the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You\u2019re not looking to reduce the numbers?\n\nOh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they\u2019re going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we\u2019ve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we\u2019re up to 73, it\u2019s going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we\u2019ve\u2026you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we\u2019re going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they\u2019re great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.\n\nAnother part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax reform didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, it actually did. But, but it\u2019s called priming the pump. You know, if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he going with taxes first, that\u2019s his wheelhouse?\u201d Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they\u2019re great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.\n\nBut beyond that it\u2019s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?\n\nIt is OK, because it won\u2019t increase it for long. You may have two years where you\u2019ll\u2026you understand the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have to prime the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s very Keynesian.\n\nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\n\nPriming the pump?\n\nYeah, have you heard it?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just\u2026I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\nYeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.\n\nSo you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?\n\nSo I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can\u2019t do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I\u2019m going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one they\u2019re leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leave\u2014go back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they\u2019re building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. They\u2019re going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.\n\nNow when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we\u2019re not leaving. I don\u2019t know if you saw what\u2019s happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They\u2019re all cancelling plans because I told them, I said\u2026I get along with them great. But I said, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, you\u2019re going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have. You\u2019re going to have a 35% tax.\u201d\n\nSo I mean, I have, it has, I haven\u2019t been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that\u2019s not a tax increase, that\u2019s no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don\u2019t leave and you won\u2019t have a\u2026but we\u2019re bringing our taxes down so low that you won\u2019t even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.\n\nThe other thing, just in case we\u2026I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. I\u2019ve been using $2.5trn, the same number we\u2019ve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, we\u2019re close. We\u2019re letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It\u2019s got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We\u2019re going to make it 10%. Now it\u2019s 35%...\n\nSorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?\n\nThe repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that\u2019s too high is the bureaucracy.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can\u2019t because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many\u2026\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re going to make it simple\n\nPresident Trump: You have to do\u2026Steve, they told me you\u2019ve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don\u2019t allow you to bring it back in.\n\nCan I ask you a question about the politics of tax?\n\nIt should be like one page.\n\nThe politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?\n\nUm. Little bit.\n\nAnd to get Democratic support, they prefer\u2026\n\nDepending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we\u2019ve got to\u2026but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It\u2019s religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]\n\nMr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they\u2019re not going to\u2026nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I\u2019ll release them. Maybe I\u2019ll release them after I\u2019m finished because I\u2019m very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\n\nHope Hicks [White House director of strategic communication]: Once the audit is over.\n\nPresident Trump: I might release them after I\u2019m out of office.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Just so you know, I\u2019ve already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe we\u2019re on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.\n\nMs Hicks: And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented before\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: By the way, so as you know I\u2019m under routine audit, so they\u2019re not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, that\u2019s something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.\n\nRight, got that.\n\nI would never do it. That would be\u2026I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.\n\nWell, the Democrats say it\u2019s important.\n\nWell, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, \u201cOh but you have to do it,\u201d I said, \u201cLook where I am\u201d. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I\u2019m under routine audit.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And the president\u2019s financial disclosure has been longer than any\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.\n\nMs Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we\u2019re focused on.\n\nPresident Trump: Right.\n\nCan I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you\u2019ve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers\u2026\n\nRight, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.\n\nBut the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t believe that. Because they\u2019re losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.\n\nBut something like eliminating the estate tax.\n\nI get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions\u2026now you\u2019re going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we\u2019re not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it\u2026you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it\u2019s pretty well covered. Hard to believe.\n\nWill you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments\u2026\n\nDo you want to answer?\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re contemplating it. We\u2019re contemplating it.\n\nContemplating getting rid of it?\n\nMr Mnuchin: No, we\u2019re contemplating keeping it. That\u2019s our preference. But we\u2019ll look at everything.\n\nSo what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.\n\nNo, I would say probably\u2026I think we\u2019re contemplating is the word. And it hasn\u2019t been determined yet, but we\u2019re contemplating.\n\nContemplating\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re contemplating various\u2026I have to say, we\u2019re contemplating various things, but one of the things that\u2019s very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it\u2019s complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.\n\nAnd are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.\n\nAre you still\u2026\n\nPart of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico\u2019s a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost\u2026we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that\u2019s like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they\u2019re down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?\n\nBut would you consider\u2026\n\nYou could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it\u2019s 17 and it\u2019s really 17 and it\u2019s a double.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right\n\nWould you consider a VAT for the United States?\n\nWell the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country because we\u2019re used to an income tax, we\u2019re used to a\u2026people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they\u2019re used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it\u2019s, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a good tax.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, \u201cYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.\u201d But the VAT is\u2026I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don\u2019t get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country, I think it\u2019s too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it\u2019s very much of a hidden tax, people don\u2019t see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week\u2026many years ago, how old is that? 35?\n\nMr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.\n\nPresident Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.\n\nBut as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?\n\nWe are dealing with Congress\u2026because it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there\u2019s still a little bit further to go because we\u2019re also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they\u2019re pulling out. You have states that aren\u2019t going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, \u201cOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,\u201d there is no Obamacare, it\u2019s dead. Plus we\u2019re subsidising it and we don\u2019t have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.\n\nYou\u2019d pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn\u2019t go through you\u2019d stop those subsidies?\n\nNo, this bill only gives them one month. They don\u2019t realize that, that\u2019s another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy\u2026\n\nThe continuation of the subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually\u2026\n\nBut my question is if the bill doesn\u2019t pass\u2026\n\nIn actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress\u2026\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass would you cut the subsidies?\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass, I\u2019d be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn\u2019t pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I\u2019d have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be much less expensive. We\u2019re going to have competition, we\u2019re getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn\u2019t pass\u2026it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t want to think about that but the answer is\u2026I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.\n\nOne of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like \u201cI want everyone to be covered\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to let people die on the streets.\n\nBut some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.\n\nOK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It\u2019s a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we\u2019re putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states do\u2026because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that\u2019ll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn\u2019t, where they\u2019re not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, \u201cIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.\u201d\n\nThe state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we\u2019re putting in $8bn and you\u2019re going to have absolute coverage. You\u2019re going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You\u2019re going to have it if you\u2019re a person going in\u2026don\u2019t forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you\u2019re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you\u2019re 70, and you really need it, you\u2019re still paying the same amount and that\u2019s really insurance.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn\u2019t heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that\u2026first of all I don\u2019t want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that hasn\u2019t been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he\u2019s been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we\u2019re\u2026you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, that will even get better as it\u2019s going along, it\u2019s going to get better. But in a way you could say, that\u2019s not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as\u2026I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that\u2019s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don\u2019t get any benefit out of it. We don\u2019t have that. We\u2019re going to have much lower premiums and we\u2019re going to have much lower deductibles.\n\nBut when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to look after people\u2026\n\nThey came through.\n\nThey came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2026Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?\n\nMike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.\n\nPresident Trump: Central casting.\n\nMr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.\n\nMs Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.\n\nPresident Trump: So I know exactly the speeches you\u2019re talking about. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow people to die on the streets\u201d, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We\u2019re talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.\n\nMr Pence: Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: People are going to have\u2026they\u2019re going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we\u2019re refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.\n\nSo, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted\u2026although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn\u2019t a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.\n\nLook, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you\u2019ll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They\u2019re so anxious to start going crazy and you know it\u2019s going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they\u2019re inundated with carriers. All different plans. That\u2019s what this is going to be like. And I said to them, \u201cWhat do you think the good plans are going to look like?\u201d He said, \u201cMr President, we\u2019re going to have so many plans. We\u2019re going to have the low version, the high version\u201d, he used the word Cadillac. I won\u2019t tell you what car he used for the low version because I don\u2019t want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [Goes off the record.]\n\nMr President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?\n\nWell I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we\u2019re going to prime the pump with the taxes because we\u2019re going to take in perhaps a little bit less, but we\u2019re going to have a lot more business, we\u2019re going to have companies coming back into the country.\n\nI know a lot of companies that want to come back in but they\u2019re not going to come back in because of taxes. And we have a lot of companies that will come back into the country. They were forced out of the country because the taxes were too high. Many, many. You look at what\u2019s going on in certain countries. In fact I own a lot of property in certain countries where they were forced out.\n\nYou look at Ireland. I own great property in Ireland that I bought during their downturn. And I give the Irish a lot, a lot of credit. They never raised their taxes. You know you would have thought when they were going through that really\u2026they would\u2019ve double and tripled their taxes. They never raised it a penny. And they got through it and they are thriving now. Ireland\u2019s done an amazing job. A lot of companies have moved to Ireland and they like it.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to be getting a lot of companies moving back and we\u2019re going to get very few companies leaving the United States because we went from the highest tax rate of\u2026not only major, you know they always say major countries, just about the highest tax rate period. And then when you add all the other things. And then when you add the regulations to the tax\u2026I\u2019ve had people tell me, because I\u2019ve cut massive regulations and we\u2019ve just started, believe me. But we\u2019ve cut regulations massively.\n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me that the cutting of those regulations is more important to them than bringing it down from 35% to 15%. And if you would have told me that, if I had a guess one before I knew the answer, I would\u2019ve said, nobody would\u2019ve taken the regulations. 90% of the people would rather have the regulations cut. So when you talk about the tax cut, the regulation cut, Dodd-Frank, you\u2019ll be doing a story on that fairly soon because we\u2019re doing a very massive overhaul on Dodd-Frank. We\u2019re doing things that are going to keep people real happy.\n\nAnd then ultimately, when I leave office, on the assumption [Mike Pence] doesn\u2019t follow me, but he will. But when I leave office what happens is slowly they\u2019ll nip away at it, nip away, nip away and then in 40, 50 years somebody else will come along and bring it back. But we\u2019re bringing back entrepreneurship. We\u2019re bringing back enthusiasm. And if you look at the people that read your magazine, that are in this country, the enthusiasm levels, and you know this because you see it, are the highest they've even been. The enthusiasm levels for manufacturers went up 27 points in two months. If it goes up a quarter of point it\u2019s like a massive\u2026it went up 27% in two months, up to 93%, they\u2019ve never been even close. The enthusiasm for business is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nMs Hicks: And we\u2019ll have you guys back to talk about it. Sorry\n\nThank you so much, Mr President.\n\nI hope you had enough time.\n\nYou\u2019ve been very kind."}

That is and must be the roleof the private sector. But at this particular moment, with theprivate sector so weakened by this recession, the federal government isthe only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy backinto life. It is only government that can break the vicious cyclewhere lost jobs lead to people spending less money, which leads to evenmore layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the planthat's moving through Congress is designed todo.\n\nWhen passed, this plan will ensure thatAmericans who'velost their jobs through no fault of their own can receivegreater unemployment benefits and continue their health carecoverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are strugglingto pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth ofbadly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. Thesesteps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who aremost likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and getour economymoving.\n\nBut as we've learned very clearly andconclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all of our economicproblems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiestfew Americans.\n\nWe have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it'sonly helped lead us to the crisis we face rightnow.\n\nAnd that's why we have come together,around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for the middle class withdirect investment in areas like health care, energy, educationand infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, create new jobsand new businesses and help our economy grow again, now and in thefuture.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the jobs createdby this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to be make-work jobsbut jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobsrebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our dangerouslydeficient dams and levees, so that we don't face anotherKatrina.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey'll be jobs building the wind turbinesand solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower our dependence on foreign oiland modernizing our costly health care system that will save usbillions of dollars and countlesslives.\n\nThey'll be jobs creating the 21st-centuryclassrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children across America. And they'llbe the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide states with somerelief.\n\nNow after many weeks of debate and discussion, the planthat ultimately emerges from Congress must be big enough and bold enoughto meet the size of the economic challenges that we face rightnow. It's a plan that is already supported by businesses representingalmost every industry in America, by both the Chamber of Commerce andthe AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from bothDemocrats and Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented levelof transparency and accountability, so that every American will beable to go online and see where and how we're spending everydime.\n\nWhat it does not contain, however, is asingle pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped of the projects membersof both parties found mostobjectionable.\n\nNow despite all of this, the plan's notperfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this plan will workexactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that afailure to act will only deepen this crisis, as well as the pain feltby millions ofAmericans.\n\nMy administration inherited a deficit ofover $1 trillion,but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergencysince the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will resultin ever -- even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence.\n\nThose are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as I hold this office, Iwill do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and putthis country back towork.\n\nI want to thank the members of Congresswho've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also want to urge all membersof Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolvetheir differences and pass thisplan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe find ourselves in a rare moment wherethe citizens of our country and all countries are watching and waiting for us tolead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, butone that we must accept for the future of our children andour grandchildren.\n\nThe strongest democracies flourish fromfrequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of every background andbelief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of agreater purpose. That's the test facing the United States of Americain this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders and citizensto stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and monthsahead.\n\nAfter a day of speaking with and listeningto the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nation home, I have full faithand confidence that we can do it.\n\nBut we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead.\n\nAnd with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let mego to Jennifer Loven at AP. There youare.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. Earlier today in Indianayou said something striking. You said that this nation could endup in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead youto say that our recession might be permanent when others in ourhistory have not? And do you think that you risk losing somecredibility or even talking down the economy by using dire language likethat?\n\nMR. OBAMA: No, no, no,no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum,which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, thenyou potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much moredifficult for us to get outof.\n\nWe saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s,where they did notact boldly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered whatwas called the \"lost decade,\" where essentially for theentire '90s, they did not see any significant economicgrowth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo what I'm trying to underscore is whatthe people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not your ordinary,run-of-the-mill recession.\n\nWe are going through the worst economic crisis since theGreat Depression.\n\nWe've lost now 3.6 million jobs. Butwhat's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken placeover the last three months, which means that the problems areaccelerating instead of getting better.\n\nNow, what I said in Elkhart today is whatI'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solvethis problem, but it's going to require us to take somesignificant, importantsteps.\n\nStep number one, we have to pass aneconomic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was avote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. Wealready have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next severaldays that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences andget that bill on mydesk.\n\nThere have been criticisms from a bunch ofdifferent directions about this bill. So let me just address a few ofthem.\n\nSome of the criticisms really are with thebasic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace.\n\nAnd in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles thatI thought were resolved a pretty long timeago.\n\nMost economists, almost unanimously,recognize that evenif philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening inthe economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now --what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businessescan't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they startlaying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending --that when you have that situation, that government is an importantelement of introducing some additional demand into the economy. Westand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and anothertrillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole inthe economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat's why the -- the figure that weinitially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't justsome random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. Thatwas Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists thatI spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis andthe fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to havea bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net jobloss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in theright direction.\n\nNow, the recovery and reinvestment packageis not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are stillgoing to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get thecredit markets flowing again, because that's the lifeblood of theeconomy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are goingto start loosening up credit once again.\n\nAnd that means having some transparency and oversight in the system.\n\nIt means that we correct some of themistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity,in terms of how the program was going to moveforward.\n\nIt means that we condition taxpayerdollars that arebeing provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when itcomes to executive compensation, not using the money to chartercorporate jets when they're notnecessary.\n\nIt means that we focus on housing and howare we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who arestill making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline.\n\nSo there's going to be a whole range ofapproaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is tomake sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making surethat the financial system is working again, that homeowners aregetting somerelief.\n\nAnd I'm happy to get good ideas fromacross the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhat I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, becausethose theories have been tested and they have failed. And that'spart of what the election in November was all about. Okay?\n\nCaren Bohan ofReuters.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. I'd like to shift gearsto foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, andwhen will you start to implement it? Will your time table beaffected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting anyindications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the UnitedStates?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I said during thecampaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary historyand traditions, but that its actions over many years now havebeen unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both inthe region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their-- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah andHamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel,their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclearweapon -- that all of those things create the possibility ofdestabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I thinkare contrary to the interests of international peace.\n\nWhat I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal,and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security teamis currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areaswhere we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engagewith them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will belooking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting acrossthe table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow usto move our policy in a new direction.\n\nThere's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nAnd it's important that even as we engagein this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that wehave as a country, that Iran understands that we find the fundingof terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about thefact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in theregion that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going tobe a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but Ithink that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship ofmutual respect andprogress.\n\nAnd I think that if you look at howwe've approached theMiddle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy tohelp deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews thatI've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to dothings differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to sendsome signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognizethat even as it is has some rights as a member of theinternational community, with those rights come responsibilities.\n\nOkay.\n\nMR. OBAMA: ChipReid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nYou have often said that bipartisanship isextraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now whenwe ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votesin the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not thenumber of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will becreated.\n\nIs that a sign that you are moving away,your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And whatwent wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to changethe way Washingtonworked?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I don't think -- Idon't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimatedit. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up herein Washington. And it's going to take time to break down some ofthose badhabits.\n\nYou know, when I made a series ofovertures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know,putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, totalk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designedsimply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try tobuild up some trust over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated.\n\nBut understand the bottom line that I'vegot right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happeningacross the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usualpolitical games. What we have to do right now is deliver for theAmerican people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recoverypackage is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, becauseeverybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting peopleback to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, thatthey can send their kids tocollege.\n\nThat doesn't negate the continuing effortsthat I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues. Andhopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civiland respectful, will pay some dividends over the longterm.\n\nThere are going to be areas where wedisagree and there are going to be areas where we agree.\n\nAs I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been saidin Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don'tdoubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should donothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing positionin negotiations, then we're probably not going to make muchprogress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't thinkwhat -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand byand donothing.\n\nThere are others who recognize that we'vegot to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what'sin there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy tohave conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut orthis infrastructure project versus that infrastructureproject.\n\nBut what I -- what I've been concernedabout is some ofthe language that's been used suggesting that this is full of porkand this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling ofthe national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage insome revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we haveright now and the economic crisis that we have rightnow.\n\nNumber two is that, although there aresome programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't jobcreators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs shouldbe out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal withthem later.\n\nBut when they start characterizing this as porkwithout acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package --something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then youget a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actuallytrying to solve problems for the Americanpeople.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo I'm going to keep on engaging. Ihope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing togive a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is notgoing to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is,arewe creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation forlong- term economicgrowth?\n\nThis is another concern that I've had insome of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste ofmoney to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that bea waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately byretrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economicstimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federalbuildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they willsee more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence onforeign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make thatkind of investment?\n\nNow, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen todisagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselvesimporting more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s,when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate aboutwhether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don'tsuggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly whatthis countryneeds.\n\nThe same applies when it comes toinformation technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businessesand making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks offamilies all across America. And part of the reason is we've got themost inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still usingpaper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nursescan't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have writtenout. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on anelectronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-termcost of health care, and create jobs rightnow?\n\nEducation, yet another example. Thesuggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad,and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacherhas to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium iscompletely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need forthe 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, rightnow will createjobs?\n\nSo, you know, we can differ on some of theparticulars,but again, the question I think that the American people are asking is,do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it todo something? If you want it to do something, then we can havea conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option frommy perspective.\n\nAll right. Chuck Todd. Where'sChuck?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. In your opening remarks,you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work,it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumerspending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people getmoney back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or payingdown debt first, before they start spending money into theeconomy?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, first of all,I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What gotus into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild riskswith other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because ofthe enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets and theywere betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in thefinancial system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat led to a contraction of credit, whichin turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meantthat everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy.\n\nSo people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made thingsworse.\n\nNow, you are making a legitimate point,Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has beendriven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's notgoing to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending andwe're not making things, then over time, other countries are going to gettired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to beover.\n\nWell, in fact, the party now isover. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is tostop the downward spiral. And that means putting money intoconsumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit.\n\nIt means putting forward investments thatnot only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economicgrowth. And that by the way is important, even if you're afiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have,with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which thereare no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at thesame time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we'vegot more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demandfor food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget.\n\nSo the most important thing we can do forour budget crisisright now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue totank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thingto do, even though I recognize that it's expensive.\n\nLook, I would love not to have to spendmoney right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned upto spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn'thow I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt toexisting circumstances.\n\nNow, what we are going to also have to dois to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we'reno longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm andlong-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true forindividual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying tofigure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financialplanning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce the economy stabilizes and people areless fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how dowe operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a freelunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house,then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably notaffordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has tobe reconsidered.\n\nSo we're going to have to change our --our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out ofthe economic slump that we'rein.\n\nAll right. Julianna Goldman,Bloomberg.\n\nQUESTION Thank you, Mr.President.\n\nMany experts, from Nouriel Roubini toSenator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, youpromised the American people that you won't just tell them what they wantto hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government needfar more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fundto really solve the credit crisis?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it'snot over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing the TARPlegislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistencyin how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- in -- in how themoney went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as weshould have.\n\nMy immediate task is making sure that thesecond half ofthat money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my firstjob. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is tomake sure that my secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, workingwith Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, are comingup with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a waythat's transparent, in a way that provides clear oversight; that weare conditioning any money that we give to banks on themreducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and to make surethat they're not wasting thatmoney.\n\nWe are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restoredwithin the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is thatnobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank,they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open thingsup and restore sometrust.\n\nWe also have to deal with the housingissue in a clearand consistentway.\n\nI don't want to preempt my secretary ofthe Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's createa template in which we're restoring market confidence. And thereason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we'regoing to need additional money or how much additional money we'll needuntil we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidencein a marketplace that the federal government and the Federal ReserveBank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing.\n\nThat can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace. Andultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that hasbeen withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence,so that private capital goes backin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOkay.\n\nJake.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. My question followsJulianna's incontent.\n\nThe American people have seen hundreds ofbillions ofdollars spent already. And still the economy continues tofree-fall.

OBAMA: Right.\n\nQUESTION: -- how canthe American people gauge whether or notyour programs areworking?\n\nCan they -- should they be looking at themetric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric shouldthey use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether ornot we need to go to a Plan B?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I think my initialmeasure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line numberone, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidenceto make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeingthat consumers are out there with a little more confidence. Andthey start making investments, which means they start hiring workers.\n\nSo step number one, jobcreation.\n\nStep number two, are we seeing the creditmarketsoperate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businessesthat I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't getcredit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was thefact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch ofRV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, buteven though their credit is good, they can't get theloan.\n\nNow, the businesses also can't get loansto make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumerscan't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit marketsis, I think, step number two.\n\nStep number three is going to behousing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn'thave complete control over that. But if our plan is effective,working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think whatwe can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can startstabilizing housing values over time.\n\nAnd the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this isan unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficultyear -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businessesstart investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, infact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumersstart feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they startmaking purchases again. And if we get things right then, startingnext year, we can start seeing some significantimprovement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEd Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There heis.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr.President. You've promised to sendmore troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear abouta time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months,I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventuallyfrom Afghanistan?\n\nAnd related to that, there's a Pentagonpolicy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming into Dover AirForce Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that itwas shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into thecountry under the cover ofnight.\n\nYou've promised unprecedentedtransparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the Americanpeople can see the full human cost of war?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Your question is timely. We got reportsthat four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to thefamilies.\n\nI've said before that, you know, peoplehave asked me, \"When did it hit you that you are now president?\" And what I toldthem was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of ourfallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carryin this office and the consequences of decisions that youmake.\n\nNow with respect to the policy of openingup media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewingthose policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. SoI don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that reviewand understand all the implicationsinvolved.\n\nWith respect to Afghanistan, this is goingto be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops andsome very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, wejust saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and youget a sense that the political system is now functioning in ameaningful way.\n\nYou do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national government seems verydetached from what's going on in the surrounding community. Inaddition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA andthese border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what wehaven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safehavens that would ultimately make our missionsuccessful.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo we are undergoing a thorough-goingreview. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his ownreview, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sentover -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluatea regional approach. We are going to need more effectivecoordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts withdevelopment efforts with more effective coordination with our allies in orderfor us to be successful.\n\nThe bottom line, though -- and I just want to rememberthe American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is thisis a situation in which a region served as the base to launch anattack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met withfamilies of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs ofallowing those safe havens toexist.\n\nMy bottom line is that we cannot allow alQaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're goingto have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, inorder to make sure that those safe havens don'texist.\n\nI do not have yet a timetable for how longthat's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allowal Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks onthe U.S. homeland. All right.\n\nHelene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here yougo.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you,sir.\n\nI wanted to ask you, on the next bankbailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this moneyto loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do youmake the case to the American people that this bailout will work whenthe last one didn't?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I --I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of youto show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to beterrific.\n\nBut this relates to Jake's earlierquestion. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who needit. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing tobusinesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are theyable to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth onMain Street?\n\nAnd the package that we've put together isdesigned to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim getshis moment in the sun tomorrow, allright?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMajor Garrett. Where isMajor?\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President,at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversationthe two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn'tdisclose. \"If we do everything right, if we do it with absolutecertainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there'sstill a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong.\"\n\nSince the vice president brought it up,can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulusbill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with that ratioof success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success?\n\nMR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) Youknow, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try thisout.\n\nI think what Joe may have been suggesting,although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to anyof this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have,any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, notall of thesolution.\n\nAnd as I said in my introductory remarks,not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. Thisis an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk toeconomists, there's some general sense of how we're going to move forward.\n\nThere's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that youshouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment,but that there should be a range ofapproaches.\n\nBut even if we do everything right onthat, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system andmaking sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to haveto deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure thatwe've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for thefinancial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks.\n\nSo I don't know whether Joe was referringto that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about theseissues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. OBAMA: I have noidea. I reallydon't.\n\nMichael Fletcher, The WashingtonPost.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you,sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroids as a member of theTexas Rangers?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think it'sdepressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight.\n\nAnd you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids.\n\nWhat I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated.\n\nAll right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens.\n\nThey're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children.\n\nAnd you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue.\n\nQUESTION: Did you get any promise from them?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat.\n\nWith respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger.\n\nAnd one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally.\n\nI think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that --\n\nMR. OBAMA: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nSam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam?\n\nQUESTION: Right here.\n\nMR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToday, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration.\n\nHe said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials?\n\nMR. OBAMA: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven't seen.\n\nWhat I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary.\n\nMy view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information.\n\nSo I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward.\n\nMara Liasson.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more.\n\nWhat do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges?\n\nMR. OBAMA: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it.\n\nAnd whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done.\n\nNow, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there.\n\nI mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultation.\n\nOne thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And let me give you a prime example.\n\nWhen it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility.\n\nHaving said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem.\n\nI think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards.\n\nSo my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package.\n\nAnd so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to be cleared up.\n\nBut I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide.\n\nAll right?\n\nSTAFF: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: One more, Mr. President.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, guys."}

The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.\n\n\u201cBecause apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,\u201d Begley said.\n\nThe White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests\u2018\u201d \u2013 she wanted respected Christian leaders \u2014 to go in and cleanse the White House or, \u2018I will not spend one night in it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him\u2014seven times he\u2019s done this\u2014that is unheard of,\u201d Begley said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t ever \u2013 the guy\u2019s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.\u201d\n\nPastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.\n\nIn his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged \u201cspirit arrived,\u201d possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.\n\nA Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is \u2013 an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.\n\nIn a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, \u201cWith fingers crossed, the old rabbit\u2019s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .\u201d\n\nLater that year Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic \u201cspirit cooking\u201d dinner parties, featuring pig\u2019s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.\n\nWith previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building."}

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn\u2019t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.\n\nIf Trump were to appear at Prince Harry\u2019s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.\n\nInstead of a state visit, Trump\u2019s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a \u201cworking trip\u201d where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go \u201cone better\u201d than Obama\u2019s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.\n\nRead more: Melania Trump \u201cwent bananas\u201d when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'\n\nThe Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.\n\nAs for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan.

I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump \u201cmisogynistic.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire."}

The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges\u2013 no trial\u2013just belief.\n\nHis intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 \u2014 teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught \u2014 and he wanted to attack this loophole. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?\u201d Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: The Democrat Party Has A New 2018 Message Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held \u2014 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.\n\nLets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don\u2019t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in \u201cfacilities\u201d so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that the program\u2019s real intent is to interrogate the kids,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are \u201coften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.\u201d While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer\u2019s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative\u2019s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.\n\nBut the program was a surprise to Mexico\n\n\u201cThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn\u2019t an announcement,\u201d said Reyna Torres Mend\u00edvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. \u201cWhere were they taking these children?\u201d\n\nRegarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.\n\nBelow is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.\n\n\ufeff\n\nNote: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants"}

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n"}

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.\n\n\u2018As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD\u2019s request for information about this \u201cevent\u201d, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion\u2013 Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73\u2014with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database \u201ctarget hit\u201d on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a \u201cprobable witness\u201d against the Clinton Foundation.,\n\n\u2018Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey\u2014and whose inclusion in the SVR\u2019s database of \u201cpotential witnesses\u201d against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a \u201ccentral identified and named figure\u201d in the creation of a document titled \u201cTraining Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine\u201d for the New Jersey Department of Education.\u2019\n\n\u2018Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis\u2014that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\u2014and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)\u2014and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its \u201cemergency administration\u201d led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it\u2014and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.\u2019\n\n\u2018Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a \u201cmain target\u201d person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history\u2014that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation\u2014and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education\u2014and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions\u2014that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses\u2019 offices throughout the United States\u2014with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools\u2014and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their \u201cEpiPen Law\u201d that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.\u2019\n\n\u2018Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch\u2014who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens\u2014became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.\u2014with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million\u2014and whose \u201cprotection\u201d for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin\u2019s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.\u2019\n\n\u2018To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her \u201cactive and knowing\u201d participation in the United States opioid crisis\u2014that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year\u2014nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma\u2014who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a \u201cblind eye\u201d to their flooding of America with opioids\u2014and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.\u2019\n\n\u2018This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee\u2014and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee\u2014that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State\u2014and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:\n\n\u201cPurdue\u2019s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.\n\nPurdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative \u2013 that long-term use of opioids didn\u2019t create addicts but instead caused \u201cpseudo addictive\u201d symptoms.\n\nThe groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee\u2019s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.\n\nPurdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher \u201cquality of life.\u201d\n\nThe firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin \u2013 Purdue\u2019s financial rainmaker \u2013 was better for patients than other opioids on the market.\u201d\n\n<img src=\"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/b4a605f160e4e0f03903a232c185067ff24b83dd8a1f8b361f2be3dfc83dbdb3.jpeg\" style=\"max-height:640px;max-width:360px;\">\n\n<span style=\"margin-top:15px;rgba(42,51,6,0.7);font-size:12px;\">Credit:<a href=\"http://www.theeventchronicle.com/cabal-exposed/new-jersey-couple-set-to-testify-to-grand-jury-against-the-clintons-die-in-new-jersey-home-explosion-2/\"> The Event Chronicle </a></span\n\nAmerican nurse Carole Paladino (above) identified by SVR as being \u201cprobable witness\u201d against Clinton\n\nFoundation\n\nRelated Coverage: <a href=\"http://thegoldwater.com/news/29430\"> Clinton Body Count Series: #1.

At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump\u2019s America if you say and do stupid crap.\n\n[Via Stryker]"}

Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\n\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s approach in the 1930\u2019s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn\u2019t happy and demanded the format be changed.\n\nAccording to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly\u2019s new show:\n\n\u201cMegyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she\u2019s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.\u201d\n\nThe problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:\n\n\u201cMs. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following. Our data tells us that our audience will tolerate and even learn to like her, but not as a political pundit or someone they should take seriously. She needs to think less Diane Sawyer and more Kelly Ripa.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Kelly couldn\u2019t do that and the whole thing came to a head this afternoon, causing NBC to pay a severance clause of $150K to cancel her contract. NBC spokesman Hugh Levitt told Fox News:\n\n\u201cMegyn Kelly was a superstar until she took on Trump. Now she\u2019s a laughing stock. She could have worked a year or two and made herself $25 million. Instead she\u2019ll spend her days looking for someone else who needs a washed up hasbeen from Fox News who knows nothing but how to piss people off.\u201d\n\nSorry, Megyn.

Rice, who served as then-President Obama's national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common.\n\nRice's previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crime\n\nBut her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians.\n\n\"I didn't hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal,\" Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican helping to lead the panel's Russia invesigation, told CNN of Rice's testimony. He declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, Rice declined to comment about her testimony. Nunes refused to answer questions when asked about Rice Tuesday evening.\n\nIt's unclear precisely which Trump officials Rice discussed at the House meeting. But multiple sources have confirmed to CNN that Zayed met at the time with Flynn, Kushner and Bannon. The three-hour discussion focused on a range of issues, including Iran, Yemen and the Mideast peace process, according to two sources who insisted that opening up a back-channel with Russia was not a topic of discussion.\n\nStill, the fact that the New York meeting occurred prior to the Seychelles session and that the UAE did not notify the Obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the United States has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on Capitol Hill.\n\nA secret meeting in the Seychelles\n\nBut the Trump Tower meeting came shortly before the UAE brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the United States and Russia, with a clandestine January meeting in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to reports in CNN and The Washington Post. That meeting is now under investigation on Capitol Hill, though it's unclear whether Rice mentioned the Seychelles meeting in the testimony.\n\nA senior Middle East official told CNN that the UAE did not \"mislead\" the Obama administration about the crown prince's visit, but acknowledged not telling the US government about it in advance. The meeting, which took place December 15, 2016, the official said, was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the Trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region.\n\n\"The meeting was about ascertaining the Trump team's view of the region and sharing the UAE's view of the region and what the US role should be,\" the official said. \"No one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment.\n\nThe Seychelles meeting -- and the circumstances around it -- has been a subject of interest to Hill investigators looking at any potential link between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe Washington Post initially reported in April that the UAE brokered a pre-inauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, who is a close Trump ally, and an associate of Vladimir Putin's in the Seychelles Islands. The purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the UAE to persuade Russia to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, according to the Post.\n\nAnd it occured shortly after Bannon, Flynn and Kushner also met in Trump Tower with Zayed, whom the Post said helped arrange the Seychelles meeting with Russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the Trump team.\n\nBut the senior Middle East official told CNN this week that Prince's name was not discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. And Prince himself has said he did nothing wrong, telling CNN's Erin Burnett last month: \"I was there for business.\"\n\nBoth the White House and Prince have strongly denied that Prince was working as a liaison for the Trump administration.\n\nPrince said he met with a Russian while at the Seychelles but \"I don't remember his name.\"\n\n\"It probably lasted about, as long as one beer,\" he said about the meeting.\n\nExplaining 'unmasking'\n\nFor her part, Rice had been called to the House Intelligence Committee to testify partly over what Nunes and other Republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of \"unmasking\" -- or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. Simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly, and Rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nBut Rice's suggestion that she unmasked the names of US individuals -- who turned out to be Trump associates -- over concerns about the propriety of the crown prince's visit to the United States could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who is helping lead the House investigation, told the Daily Caller \"nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude\" that she improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates or leaked it to the press.\n\nSarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say explicitly whether Trump still believes Rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated.\n\n\"We've seen illegal leaking of classified materials, including the identities of American citizens unmasked in intelligence reports,\" Sanders told CNN. \"That's why the President called for Congress to investigate this matter and why the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security.\"\n\nNunes was forced to step aside from running the Russia investigation amid a House ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data. The ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that Obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates, a revelation that Trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him. The Justice Department said in a court filing Friday that the DOJ and the FBI have no evidence to support Trump's claims.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the Republican who took over the investigation from Nunes said there was no reason to bring Rice in for further questioning.\n\n\"She was a good witness, answered all our questions,\" Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican now running the House Russia probe, told CNN. \"I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.\""}

It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.\n\nAmericans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.\n\nCruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201d\n\nCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201d\n\nAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201d\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\n\u201cImpeach!\u201d It\u2019s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word \u2013 long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the \u201cI\u201d word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked \u201cWatergate.\u201d\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left\u2019s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America\u2019s new Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,\u201d says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. \u201cNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I\u2019m not going to stop asking them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans\u2019 tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. \u2026 Resign now.\u201d\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned \u201cimpeachment\u201d enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, there\u2019s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\n\u201cThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,\u201d Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless \u201cgotcha\u201d announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence \u201ccorruptly\u201d when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted \u201cwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.\u201d Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with \u201cradical\u201d positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That\u2019s what I believe,\u201d declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. \u201cI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that\u2019s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,\u201d Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would \u201cput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just totally against the whole shebang, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it\u2019s father has done to you, come on.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: \u201cDon\u2019t know yet, first thing\u2019s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.\u201d/SOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}

How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor\u2019s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.\n\nHorst Seehofer, Merkel\u2019s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent\u2019s struggle with migration.\n\nBavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:\n\nCompromise\n\nThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.\n\nMerkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.\n\nNo Compromise\n\nIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That\u2019s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel\u2019s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it\u2019s hard to see how the coalition continues.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.\n\nConfidence vote\n\nFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party\u2019s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.\n\nGermany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It\u2019s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.\n\nMerkel resigns\n\nShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany\u2019s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.\n\nSplit on the right\n\nThe CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right\u2019s Bavarian chapter \u2014 the CDU operates in all of Germany\u2019s 16 states except Bavaria.\n\nSo a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU\u2019s position.\n\nA hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel\u2019s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. \u201cWe should all remain calm,\u201d he said."}

He Hasn't Stopped https://t.co/BlnOWoK5Jy", "article": "David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a \u201cpop\u201d while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a \u201cCode Red\u201d exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.\n\nAnd then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor\u2014Hogg doesn\u2019t know his name but calls him an angel\u2014knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg\u2014who\u2019s an editor at the school\u2019s TV station\u2014found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.\n\nThe shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in there, I thought, \u2018What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?\u2019\u201d Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. \u201cAnd the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that\u2019s all I could think: Get other people\u2019s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that\u2019s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It\u2019s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it\u2019s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.\n\n\u201cWhen do we say, that\u2019s not acceptable, something has to change?\u201d asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.\n\nHogg\u2019s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action\n\nWill Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman\u2019s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven\u2019t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn\u2019t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher\u2019s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.\n\n\u201cIt was hot in there. We were packed in tight,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cSome students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.\u201d Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.\n\n\u201cMy husband is ex-military, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re anti-gun. But an AR-15?\u201d Kristi Gilroy said. \u201cYou tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?\u201d Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she\u2019d taught when they were younger.\n\nThe usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. \u201cNow, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,\u201d Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. \u201cOur students are asking for that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.\n\n\u201cTo every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she\u2019d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. \u201cHaving to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,\u201d she said, her eyes full of tears.\n\nTo some, however, words of comfort won\u2019t be enough. \u201cWhen do we actually stand up? I think it\u2019s the time that we all stand up,\u201d Hogg demanded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it\u2019s going to be your child that\u2019s next. And that\u2019s horrifying.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it\u2019s okay to go back to school, that they\u2019re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."}

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking \u201cout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,\u201d according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a \u201csanctuary county\u201d in May 2014. The county only cooperates with \u201cICE holds\u201d if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s immigration status has not yet been announced.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff Department\u2019s \u201c1.0 Policy Statement\u201d reads: \u201cNo person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.\u201d The policy adds that \u201cthe immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel execute their duties.\u201d\n\nAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.\n\nSonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated \u2014 about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion."}

Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. \u201cIf you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a fact.\u201d\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president\u2019s power, or in other words, its limitations \u2013 if they exist \u2013 Spicer argued that the Constitution \u201cclearly states\u201d what the President of the United States can and cannot do. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cone must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn\u2019t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president\u2019s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn\u2019t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.\u201d\n\nSpicer continued, \u201cAs a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there\u2019s a real need to follow the aforementioned \u2018if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president\u2019 rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that\u2019s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Spicer concluded."}

Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.\u201d\n\nClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.\n\nAl Gore\u2019s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 \u2013 a year that was touted as being \u201cthe hottest ever\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history \u2013 there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.\n\nDebunking the \u201c97 percent\u201d lie\n\nOn top of those \u201cinconvenient truths,\u201d the White House\u2019s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \u201c97 percent\u201d statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.\n\nMore objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.\n\nFrom the National Review:\n\n\u201cA 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\u201d\n\nAl Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax\n\nBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you\u2019re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 \u2013 largely due to investments in fake \u201cgreen tech\u201d companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.\n\nYou might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.\n\nUpdate: We have updated the headline to make it clear that the signatures of the petition were not all scientists. Some were academics, others scientists and the rest were university graduates who hold a B.S. degree or higher."}

Intelligence and Z|13 Security, suspect the source of the recent White House leaks to be President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nIf you\u2019ve recently seen the hashtag \u2013 #DitchTheDevice trending on social media, it\u2019s because, according to several private intelligence reports, the source of the multiple recent leaks within the White House is President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nThroughout the past several weeks President Trump and his administration have expressed extreme frustration over the multiple leaks provided to members of the press from inside the White House.\n\nThe recent leaks range from information regarding his executive orders (before he issued them), fighting and chaos among White House staffers, classified conversations with foreign leaders (specifically Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull & Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto), White House staffers conducting meetings in the dark because they can\u2019t figure out how the lights work, and President Trump wandering the White House in his bathrobe.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly dismissed the leaks and has referred to the leaked information as \u2013 \u201cIllegal Leaks\u201d while vowing to go after those revealing sensitive information to the press.\n\nAccording to information from an unconnected Washington insider, President Trump, who remains leery of the federal intelligence community and is suspicious enough of career politicians that he\u2019s accused holdovers from the Obama Administration as being the ones responsible for leaking information, decided to contract multiple private intelligence agencies to investigate the leaks.\n\nInitial reports from two such agencies, A.R.H. Intelligence and Z|13 Security, indicate they suspect the source of the recent White House leaks to be President Trump\u2019s unsecured Android device.\n\nPresident Trump has received fierce criticism since his inauguration for refusing to part with his personal, consumer-grade Android smartphone while in the White House. The primary concern with President Trump maintaining his personal Android device while serving as the POTUS, is that the phone in question is probably not being aggressively protected from malware or phishing attacks/attempts.\n\nAccording to security experts, clicking on just one malicious link (often disguised to look as if it was sent from a trusted source) could easily compromise the device \u2013 giving hackers free-reign over the phone\u2019s microphone, camera, contacts, stored data, and browser history.\n\nInvestigators from A.R.H. Intelligence and Z|13 Security believe that the unsecured Android device was most likely compromised by a suspicious animated GIF that was sent to President Trump via text message.\n\nAccording to information from Thomas McDowell, an associate at A.R.H. Intelligence, the text message containing the GIF (which reportedly displayed an animated cartoon-like image of Trump giving Russian President, Vladimir Putin, a friendly hug) appeared to have been sent to President Trump as a joke by a long-time friend/acquaintance.\n\nMcDowell believes that the animated GIF could have contained spyware and could have been sent by an unknown hacker who coded the text message to appear as if it was sent by a trusted source \u2013 an (unnamed) long-time friend and acquaintance of President Trump.\n\nIf a hacker did gain access to the unsecured Android device, it\u2019s possible they activated the device\u2019s built-in microphone and camera and in-turn leaked the sensitive information gathered to members of the press.\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear if the president intends to rid himself of the unsecured smartphone, however, many of President Trump\u2019s supporters and critics alike have taken to social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook to encourage the president to trade in his unsecured Android phone for a standard White House approved communication device by using the hashtag \u2013 #DitchTheDevice\n\nWe\u2019ll provide updates to this developing story as we receive them."}

For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a \u201cgunshot to the head\u201d that\u2019s been ruled a \u201csuicide\u201d by the Miami-Dade\u2019s medical examiner records supervisor.\n\nKlaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.\n\nEberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.\n\nEberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government\u2019s economic development agency, Fonds d\u2019assistance \u00e9conomique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% \u2013 or $5.4 billion \u2013 was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,\u201d Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.\n\nThe former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza \u2014 the Klaus Special \u2014 named after him.\n\nAccording to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in \u201cgood spirits\u201c, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really shocking,\u201d said Muncheez\u2019s owner Gilbert Bailly. \u201cWe grew up together; he was like family.\u201d \u2013Your News Wire\n\nAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton\u2019s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton\u2019s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.\n\nSansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to \u201cside\u201d with the Clinton Administration and he would \u201cbe the richest man in Haiti.\u201d\n\nHe also demanded that Hillary Clinton \u201cdisclose the audit of all money\u201d related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cNot even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.\u201d\n\nGo to the 5 minute mark of the video to see Sansaricq\u2019s comments to candidate Trump:\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}

The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf\u2019s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.\n\nThe 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda \u2014 unless, of course, it\u2019s funny. \u201cYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn\u2019t do on TV,\u201d Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix\u2019s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: \"We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.\"\n\nThe announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (\"I want equal pay! And a chardonnay\") to dating and other social issues.\n\nThough Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.\n\nBy jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central \u2014 and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network\u2019s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.\n\nLooking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President\u2019s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.\n\nWolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."}

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.\n\nCNN\u2019s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.\n\nIn other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.\n\nFox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN\u2019s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN\u2019s 635K.\n\nWhile MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.\n\nIncredibly, CNN\u2019s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.\n\nCompared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.\n\nDuring the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.\n\nBy comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.\n\nMSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.\n\nThe third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC\u2019s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.\n\nDuring primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.\n\nThe bottom line is that CNN\u2019s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis."}

America is a land of laws and those wishing to immigrate to the country must follow the proper laws and protocol because people cannot simply walk in without following the rules. Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally.\n\nOut of those 1,600 it\u2019s unknown how many people have criminal records, but they were all about to have a criminal record if they broke into a country illegally. The National Guard helped protect the border and provided the extra manpower that was needed to keep the situation under control. It was reported that the level of criminal activity has slowed due to the agents being present.\n\nThe Washington Examiner provided this information about the border situation: \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border, CBP and defense officials said Wednesday.\n\nNational Guard officials overseeing the border state deployments said troops helping monitor the international boundary have freed up more border agents to physically guard the border. The result has led to a surge in the amount of criminal activity agents have stopped.\n\nTrending: BUSTED!! Hillary\u2019s Strange Scarf Accidentally Slips Off In Public Exposes What She\u2019s Been Hiding For Months!\n\nThe increased surveillance and communication between guardsmen and border officers also led to CBP intercepting an additional 451 people who were turned back before illegally entering the U.S.\n\nThose numbers could tick up considerably if the 4,000 National Guard troops President Trump approved on April 4 are called on in a future request from CBP.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 775 troops have been deployed and are on the ground providing \u201cdirect support on the ground\u201d in seven sectors assisting law enforcement officers.\n\nTroops are providing support from the air, surveillance back-up, and assistance with infrastructure projects like vegetation clearing and road maintenance, not including to the border wall construction. Another task is to specifically free up agents to leave their desks and get back out to the field. The troops monitoring remote video surveillance systems have then been able to report sightings to a greater field of agents and thus, the number of apprehensions has increased, officials said.\n\n\u201cThose folks are giving us the additional situational awareness in the radio rooms \u2026 which are allowing the Border Patrol agents sitting in those areas to go into the field,\u201d said one National Guard official, who described the addition of the Guard as a \u201cforce-multiplier\u201d for the CBP.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, these guardsmen are not carrying out law enforcement duties,\u201d an official representing the Texas National Guard said.\n\nGuardsmen have been deployed to the following Border Patrol sectors: 200 to the Rio Grande Valley, 120 to Laredo, 90 to Del Rio, 70 to Big Bend, 110 to El Paso, 135 to Tuscon, and 50 to Yuma.\n\nIn late April, the California National Guard said 200 guardsmen were in training at Camp Roberts and would be deployed in early May. Around 55 troops are already working in those sectors.\n\nThe deployment is funded through the end of fiscal year 2018, September 30. Ronald Vitiello, CBP deputy commissioner, said in April the intent of the mission is for CBP to regain operational control of the border.\u201d\n\nWith the deployment being funded through to the end of the fiscal year of 2018, that means the law should likely be upheld for quite a while until it\u2019s time to renew the budget or the illegal swarm backs off and follows the law.\n\nSome critics are upset that America won\u2019t simply allow people to break into the country, but borders exist for reasons and permit the land to adhere to their laws. Some people want borderless countries, but that would result in absolute chaos much like what\u2019s happening to Germany, Sweden, and London where they have been ravaged by refugees.\n\nWill you comment below and share this to your friends? Will you start a conversation about borders and the proper protocol that it takes to enter a country the legal way.\n\nSource:Viralwdc"}

Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian compares the law to Hitler:\n\n\u201cThere is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists \u2013 and even \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s right\u2014because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow \u201cintolerant.\u201d Well do you know what most Americans think?\n\nYou\u2019re damn right it\u2019s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500\u2019s AD? We shouldn\u2019t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.\n\nThankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is \u201cunfair,\u201d and \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.\n\nDespite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there\u20146th safest in the world, to be exact.\n\n\u201cAlthough Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.\u201d\n\nAfter the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.\n\nWith the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving."}

The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.\n\nMany are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.\n\nWhen asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, \u201cThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.\u201d\n\nAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.\n\nOfficials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.\n\nAccording to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.\n\nLittleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Most liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.\n\nMany people ascertain that the United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it certainly sounds like representatives of the United States promised \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the UN\u2019s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe UN conference \u201cprovided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,\u201d according to politifact.\n\nPolitifact also claimed, \u201cCaroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.\u201d Adding,\n\n\u201c\u2018The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,\u2019 Dorminey wrote in an email. \u2018The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion \u2014 especially across borders \u2014 that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.'\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade \u2014 not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.'\u201d\n\nHowever, the wording here is suspicious.\n\nThe Third Review Conference for the UN\u2019s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American \u2018representatives\u2019 at the conference agreed to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce \u201cproper management\u201d of \u201csmall arms and light weapons\u201d stockpiles.\n\nIt appears that the agreement could also include \u2018stockpiles\u2019 owned by American citizens.\n\nAccording to some, the United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name. Many think they are hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.\n\nThe conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.\n\nThis will serve as a means for the United Nations to find \u2018illicit\u2019 ammunition and firearms.\n\nIf the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN\u2019s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.\n\nHowever, it gets worse still. The \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 also allows UN \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 to go to member nations to \u2018assist\u2019 in meeting the goals of the program.\n\nSo, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to \u2018help\u2019 speed the process up.\n\nThe conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.\n\nFirstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).\n\nSecondly, they agreed to strengthen \u2018coordinated approaches\u2019 nationally for implementing the PoA.\n\nThirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.\n\nFourth, the representatives agreed to create a \u2018national point of contact\u2019 to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.\n\nFifth, they promised to \u2018make better use\u2019 of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be \u2018in compliance\u2019 with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and \u2018non-proliferation,\u2019 which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.\n\nFinally, they agreed to \u2018significantly reduce\u2019 illicit flows of small arms through means such as \u2018voluntary surrender\u2019 programmes and \u2018illicit weapons\u2019 recovery.\n\nIn other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.\n\nIf they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.\n\nThis agreement seems wildly unconstitutional, but UN officials don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nBy requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it seems to violate the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are \u201creserved to the states respectively.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a \u2018liaison\u2019 between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.\n\nPerhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the \u2018illicit firearms trade.\u2019"}

In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.\n\nIn part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would \u201cbring back\u201d the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nskip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\n>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysis\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 1\n\nNo one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as \u201c birth of our savior \u201c.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion \u2014 Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 2\n\n@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on seasonal \u201cgenerosity.\u201d She related the story of St. Matthew\u2019s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can\u2019t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders\u2019 story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such \u201cstories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that\u2019s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.\n\nskip - Ivanka Trump tweet\n\nAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on \u201cthis sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.\u201d\n\nskip - Ivanka's defiance\n\nTRUMP\u2019s DAUGHTER IS AGAINST CHRISTMAS!!! WHAT WILL FOX NEWS DO?\u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d Ivanka Trump, White House adviser, tweeted earlier this month, adding a kissy-face emoji. She dared do this in a tweet that included a photo of her posing in front of Christmas trees. \u2014 Joan Strong (@TruthInJeopardy) December 23, 2017\n\nShapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had \u201cworked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.\u201d He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nskip - Eric Trump tweet\n\nBut as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn\u2019t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.\n\nTrue, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it \u2013 though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nIndeed, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the \u201creturn to Merry Christmas\u201d message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.\n\nShe seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d with no mention of the \u201cC-word,\u201d in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father\u2019s \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d rhetoric.\n\nFor those who would chalk up Ivanka\u2019s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.\n\nEven Melania Trump\u2019s much publicized \u2013 and much maligned \u2013 choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a cr\u00e8che display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.\n\nAll of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump\u2019s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and pro-\u201cHappy Holidays\u201d conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn\u2019t at all reflective of mainstream America.\n\nThat feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than they had in the past.\n\nThe Pew poll reported: \u201cA rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d\n\nskip - Politicization of Christmas\n\nI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. \u2014 Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.\n\nskip - Feraz Ozel tweet\n\n\u2018My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas\u2019 \u2014 Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the \u2018War on Christmas\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017\n\nThis year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business\u2019 choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third \u2013 32 percent \u2013 said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d during the holidays.\n\nOverall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump\u2019s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe that the \u201cbiblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events\u201d is \u201cshrinking,\u201d it said, and \u201ca declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d obsession shores up his status with evangelicals \u2013 even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don\u2019t care much how it\u2019s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.\n\nIn a blow to the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d theory from one of Trump\u2019s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 if the time is right,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cJust because some people say \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to people who don\u2019t celebrate it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.\u201d"}

The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn\u2019t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might\u2019ve been exposed to.\n\n(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)\n\nChemical attack or no, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn\u2019t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these \u201creal\u201d patients to confirm an attack."}

Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation\u2019s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the \u201clargest scam\u201d that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.\n\nThe scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:\n\n\u201cOfficials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.\n\nFederal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.\n\nOne of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.\n\nFederal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam\u2019s value.\n\n\u2018Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,\u2019 Sessions said.\n\nA physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.\u201d\n\nThe ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers\u2019 noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here\u2019s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet\u2026all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.\n\nOther nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid\u2019s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.\n\nMore than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit.

Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid\u2019s companies\u2019 fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.\n\nWe must continue to sound the alarm about what\u2019s going right underneath our noses.

Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong.\n\nBut if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days.\n\nI do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds \u201cin excess of 157 MPH.\u201d\n\nI doubt my condo complex could withstand it. I cannot even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load. I suspect some of them \u2014 MANY of them \u2014 might just snap and fall over.\n\nEven buildings which don\u2019t simply blow over, would probably see ALL their windows blown out.\n\nCan you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly!\n\nIn all of recorded history, no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be beyond \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d Seems to me, there would be NOTHING left!\n\nI emphasize that I know computer \u201cmodels\u201d are just that: MODELS. They may be very wrong.\n\nBut given the specificity of this particular forecast, I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day. If it appears as you see in the model video below, then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ.\n\nNo one would be able to survive this type of storm.\n\nHere now, the GFS Model which was issued by the National Weather Service at 2:00 PM EDT on Friday, September 1, 2017:"}

Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he\u2019s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump\u2019s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nReports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI\u2019s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok \u201cintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.\u201d\n\nThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with \u201cspecific investigative decisions,\u201d but said that comment and others \u201cimplies a willingness to take official action.\u201d\n\nStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn\u2019t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump\u2019s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that \u201cI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.\n\nGoelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent \u201cintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that\u2019s a topic, and his own integrity.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general\u2019s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump\u2019s allies from calling for Mueller\u2019s immediate suspension.\n\nWhy was the FBI\u2019s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\n\u201cThe highest level of bias I\u2019ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.\u201d Trey Gowdy on the FBI\u2019s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn\u2019t it? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nStrzok still works for the FBI, but it\u2019s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action."}

In an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d the \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I\u2019m not free anymore,\u201d Gaga said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody\u2019s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can\u2019t even call the police to help me because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d the singer complained. \u201cI realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I\u2019d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off \u2013 we\u2019ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.\u201d\n\nAsked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn\u2019t her \u201cfirst choice,\u201d as well as that \u201che couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,\u201d due to the fact that \u201cI might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.\u201d \u201cIt was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven\u2019t been able to do that in a long time,\u201d she revealed.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I\u2019m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,\u201d the singer revealed. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that\u2019ll cover my face, but what I do know is that\u2019s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I\u2019m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody\u2019s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I\u2019m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I\u2019ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,\u201d Gaga concluded."}

The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.\n\n\u201cICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,\u201d Fallon tweeted. \u201cDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\u201d\n\nThomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.\n\n\u201cThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,\u201d Homan said Thursday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\nBut the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.\n\n\u201cICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,\u201d Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. \u201cBut let\u2019s not abuse the power.\u201d\n\nSince then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,\u201d Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. \u201cIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.\u201d\n\nMirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- \u201cshould be asked the same question.\u201d\n\nPELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS \u2018UNJUST AND CRUEL\u2019\n\nThe Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\u201d The writer accused the agency of being part of an \u201cunbridled white-supremacist surveillance state\u201d and called it \u201can unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it\u2019s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,\u201d McElwee wrote.\n\nDemocratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff\u2019s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.\n\nSESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR \u2018RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA\u2019\n\nSessions called California\u2019s \"open borders\" policies a \u201cradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can this be a sound policy?\u201d"}

A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.\n\nMany have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she\u2019d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.\n\nMichelle\u2019s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that\u2019s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.\n\nBiz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama\u2019s administration before Trump took office:\n\nWhy is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband\u2019s presidency?\n\nDr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, \u201cOn Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.\u201d\n\nWright diagnosed Mrs. Obama\u2019s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in legacy building mode. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is the time she\u2019s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.\u201d\n\nAs First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.\n\n\u201cI think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that\u2019s been true over the last three administrations,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOf her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she\u2019s now suffering a feeling of \u201chopelessness\u201d with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It\u2019s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.\n\nThe best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.\n\nDean James from America\u2019s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she\u2019s more than profited off of:\n\nSo, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness\u2026 This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.\n\nHey lady, I hate to break it to you but your \u2018husband\u2019 has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.\n\nThe truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was."}

The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.\n\nEver since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia\u2019s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.\n\nNow, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change.

Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson\u2019s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of \u2018truth\u2019.\n\n\u2018At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks\u2019 says the artist \u2018yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a \u2018mental image\u2019 rather than a direct record of reality\u2019\n\nJackson\u2019s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson\u2019s productions \u2013 where the likenesses are recognisable \u2013 use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation."}

Maybe not my generation, but certainly that of my kids.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland.\n\nAccording to Sputnik News, a member of Finland\u2019s conservative Finn Party recently recommended implanting satellite-tracking chips inside of welfare recipients in response to news that some recipients continued to receive payments after leaving the country to fight for the Islamic State.\n\nPasi Maenranta, the politician who suggested the idea, argued on his Facebook page that in order to receive welfare payments from Kela, \u201cone has to tell exact data about your location using your personal code, read by a satellite.\u201d\n\nMaenranta also noted that it would be possible to implant microchips beneath the skin of all those traveling overseas \u201cwho for example receive medical welfare from Kela,\u201d also known as the Social Insurance Institution.\n\nBut regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips.\n\nCan they ever be turned off or removed?
