{"article": "2:04 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.\n\n\n\nThrough more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.\n\n\n\nOur partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.\n\n\n\nAnd so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.\n\n\n\nAnd so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: \"In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?\"\n\n\n\nAnd the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldn\u2019t be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.\n\n\n\nAnd this one comes from William Smith: \"What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.\n\n\n\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didn\u2019t have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.\n\n\n\nIt also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.\n\n\n\nI think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn\u2019t realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.\n\n\n\nAnd so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people\u2019s expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.\n\n\n\nThe other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasn\u2019t bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And so that\u2019s continued to be a big drag on the economy.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things we\u2019ve done, that\u2019s probably been the area that\u2019s been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: \"Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s not an either/or question; it\u2019s a both/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.\n\n\n\nWhat we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s great that we have an Apple that\u2019s creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if we\u2019re also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.\n\n\n\nAnd there are going to be a series of decisions that we\u2019ve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own can\u2019t always finance the basic research because they can\u2019t be assured that they\u2019re going to get a return on it.\n\n\n\nNumber two, we\u2019ve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.\n\n\n\nNumber three, we\u2019ve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and we\u2019ve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. We\u2019ve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.\n\n\n\nSo you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: \"Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans it\u2019s becoming too expensive. What can be done?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. We\u2019ve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that we\u2019ve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.\n\n\n\nIn addition, what we\u2019ve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, I\u2019m a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.\n\n\n\nI do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that it\u2019s important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.\n\n\n\nOne last point -- I know, Twitter, I\u2019m supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. That\u2019s a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. That\u2019s come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: \"Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, he\u2019s looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nLet me, as quickly as I can, describe what\u2019s at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. It\u2019s a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn\u2019t mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.\n\n\n\nSo this is something that we shouldn\u2019t be toying with. What Dexter\u2019s question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, it\u2019s unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. We\u2019ve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: \"Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019re working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, you\u2019ve got a PhD in computer science or you\u2019ve got a PhD in engineering, and you say I\u2019m ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But it\u2019s important for us to look at it more broadly. We\u2019ve got an immigration system that\u2019s broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And we\u2019ve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We don\u2019t want that -- we don\u2019t want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: \"Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that I\u2019m very proud of and doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.\n\n\n\nA great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And we\u2019re projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. That\u2019s creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.\n\n\n\nAnd whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that we\u2019ve determined and also just general askObama questions.\n\n\n\nSo our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: \u201cMr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.\n\n\n\nNow, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they can\u2019t compete, then that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good.\n\n\n\nIn the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with what\u2019s happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I don\u2019t have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary I\u2019m paying has a better deal?\n\n\n\nWhat this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, that\u2019s something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\n\n\nSo, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting people\u2019s collective bargaining rights.\n\n\n\nI'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasn\u2019t real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.\n\n\n\nBy the way, people who work in the White House, they\u2019ve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they haven\u2019t had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there haven\u2019t, either. In fact, they\u2019ve seen their pay cut in some cases.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: \u201cHow will admin work to help underwater homeowners who aren\u2019t behind in payments but are trapped in homes they can\u2019t sell?\u201d From Robin.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.\n\n\n\nWhat's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if they\u2019re selling, they\u2019ve got to sell at a massive loss that they can\u2019t afford. It means that they don\u2019t feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.\n\n\n\nSo what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they don\u2019t feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where they\u2019re raising their families.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But it\u2019s not enough. And so we\u2019re going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: \u201cAfter embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?\u201d And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all --\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, he\u2019s a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what he\u2019s right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.\n\n\n\nAnd over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so we\u2019re each month seeing growth in jobs, But when you\u2019ve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and you\u2019re only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously that\u2019s way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means they\u2019re spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.\n\n\n\nWe have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they\u2019re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019ll give you a specific example.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesn\u2019t make sense. We don\u2019t have the kind of electric grid that\u2019s smart, meaning it doesn\u2019t waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.\n\n\n\nFor us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where we\u2019re putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And it\u2019s an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.\n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t gotten the kind of cooperation that I\u2019d like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But I\u2019m just going to keep on trying and eventually I\u2019m sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, there\u2019s a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: \u201cSmall biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that we\u2019ve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if they\u2019re making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So we\u2019re already initiating a bunch of steps.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, they\u2019re not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but they\u2019re getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.\n\n\n\nAnd so, what we\u2019ve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And that\u2019s helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.\n\n\n\nQ Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: \u201cMy question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is something that I\u2019ve been talking a lot about internally. We\u2019ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn\u2019t serve. And that makes no sense.\n\n\n\nSo what we\u2019d like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that we\u2019ve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: \u201cWas it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\nIn December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing \"don't ask, don't tell,\" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didn\u2019t like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.\n\n\n\nIn exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every American, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.\n\n\n\nIt would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasn\u2019t the deal that was available. But here\u2019s the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that aren\u2019t working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And that\u2019s going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.\n\n\n\nSo what I\u2019m hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, here\u2019s a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: \"What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, it\u2019s important for people to realize that since I\u2019ve been in office I\u2019ve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.\n\n\n\nAnd so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They\u2019re lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. They\u2019re lower than they were under Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what I\u2019ve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the notion that corporate jets should get a better deal than commercial jets, or the notion that oil and gas companies that made tens of billions of dollars per quarter need an additional break to give them an incentive to go drill for oil -- that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is people like me who have been incredibly fortunate, mainly because a lot of folks bought my book -- (laughter) -- for me to be able to go back to the tax rate that existed under Bill Clinton, to pay a couple of extra percentage points so that I can make sure that seniors still have Medicare or kids still have Head Start, that makes sense to me. And, Jack, we haven\u2019t talked about this before, but I\u2019m assuming it makes sense to you, given Twitter has done pretty well. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nI think that for us to say that millionaires and billionaires can go back to the tax rate that existed when Bill Clinton was President, that doesn\u2019t affect middle-class families who are having a tough time and haven\u2019t seen their incomes go up. It does mean that those who are in the top 1-2 percent, who have seen their incomes go up much more quickly than anybody else, pays a little bit more in order to make sure that we can make the basic investments that grow this country -- that\u2019s not an unreasonable position to take. And the vast majority of Americans agree with me on that.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we can just continue spending anything we want. We\u2019re still going to have to make some tough decisions about defense spending, or even some programs that I like but we may not need. But we can\u2019t close the deficit and debt just by cutting things like Head Start or Medicare. That can\u2019t be an equitable solution to solving the problem. And then, we say to millionaires and billionaires, you don\u2019t have to do anything. I don\u2019t want a $200,000 tax break if it means that some senior is going to have to pay $6,000 more for their Medicare that they don\u2019t have, or a bunch of kids are going to be kicked off of Head Start and aren\u2019t going to get the basics that they need in order to succeed in our society. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for me; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the country.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So we have a follow-up question to your answer about homeowners being underwater. And this one came in under 10 minutes ago from Shnaps: \"Is free-market an option? Obama on homeowners underwater: have made some progress, but plus needed looking at options.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, when Shnaps -- (laughter) -- when Shnaps talks about free market options, I mean, keep in mind that most of this is going to be a function of the market slowly improving because people start having more confidence in the economy; more people decide, you know what, the housing market has kind of bottomed out, now is the time to buy. They start buying. That starts slowly lifting up prices, and you get a virtuous cycle going on.\n\n\n\nSo a lot of this is going to be determined by how well the overall economy does: Do people feel more confident about jobs? Do they feel more confident that they\u2019re going to be able to make their mortgage? And given the size of the housing market, no federal program is going to be able to solve the housing problem. Most of this is going to be free market.\n\n\n\nThe one thing that we can do it make sure that for homeowners who have been responsible, didn\u2019t buy more house than they could afford, had some tough luck because they happened to buy at the top of the market, can afford to continue to pay for that house, can afford their current mortgage, but need some relief, given the drop in value -- that we try to match them up with bankers so that each side ends up winning. The banker says, you know, I\u2019m going to be better off than if this house is foreclosed upon and I have to sell it at a fire sale. The mortgage owner is able to stay in their home, but still pay what\u2019s owed.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that that kind of adjustment and negotiation process is tough. It\u2019s difficult partly because a lot of banks these days don\u2019t hold mortgages. They were all sold to Wall Street and were sliced and diced in these complex financial transactions. So sorting through who owns what can be very complicated. And as you know, some of the banks didn\u2019t do a very good job on filing some of their papers on these foreclosure actions, and so there\u2019s been litigation around that.\n\n\n\nBut the bottom line is we should be able to make some progress on helping some people, understanding that some folks just bought more home than they could afford and probably they\u2019re going to be better off renting.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So 10 percent of our questions now are about education, and this one was surfaced from our curator in California by Marcia: \u201cPublic education here in California is falling apart, not graduating enough skilled workers or smart citizens. Privatization looming?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, when America was making a transition from an agricultural society to an industrial society, we as a country made a decision that we were going to have public high schools that would upgrade the skills of young people as they were leaving the farms and start participating in a more complex industrial economy. When my grandfather\u2019s generation came back from World War II, we made a decision that we were going to have a GI Bill that would send these young people to college because we figured that would help advance our economy.\n\n\n\nEvery time we\u2019ve made a public investment in education, it has paid off many times over. For us now to give short shrift to education when the world is more complex than ever, and it\u2019s a knowledge-based society and companies locate based on whether they\u2019ve got skilled workforces or not, that makes no sense.\n\n\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve got to get our priorities straight here. It is important for us to have a healthy business climate, to try to keep taxes low, to make sure that we\u2019re not spending on things that don\u2019t work. It\u2019s important that we get a good bang for the buck in education. And so my administration has pushed more reform more vigorously across the country through things like Race to the Top than most previous administrations have been able to accomplish. So we don\u2019t just need more money; we need more reform.\n\n\n\nBut we do have to pay for good teachers. Young, talented people aren\u2019t going to go into teaching if they\u2019re getting paid a poverty wage. We do have to make sure that buildings aren\u2019t crumbling. It's pretty hard for kids to concentrate if there are leaks and it\u2019s cold and there are rats running around in their schools. And that\u2019s true in a lot of schools around the country.\n\n\n\nWe do have to make sure that there are computers in a computer age inside classrooms, and that they work and that there\u2019s Internets that are actually -- there are Internet connections that actually function.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that those states that are going to do well and those countries that do well are the ones that are going to continue to be committed to making education a priority.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: We have another follow-up sent about 10 minutes ago in response to your answer on Vietnam vets. From Brendan: \u201cWe definitely need to get more vets into jobs, but when are we going to support the troops by cutting oil dependence?\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Reducing our dependence on oil is good for our economy, it\u2019s good for our security, and it\u2019s good for our planet -- so it\u2019s a \"three-fer.\" And we have not had a serious energy policy for decades. Every President talks about it; we don\u2019t get it done.\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019d like to see robust legislation in Congress that actually took some steps to reduce oil dependency. We\u2019re not going to be able to replace oil overnight. Even if we are going full-throttle on clean energy solutions like solar and wind and biodiesel, we\u2019re going to need oil for some time. But if we had a goal where we\u2019re just reducing our dependence on oil each year in a staggered set of steps, it would save consumers in their pocketbook; it would make our businesses more efficient and less subject to the whims of the spot oil market; it would make us less vulnerable to the kinds of disruptions that have occurred because of what happened in the Middle East this spring; and it would drastically cut down on our carbon resources.\n\n\n\nSo what I -- unfortunately, we have not seen a sense of urgency coming out of Congress over the last several months on this issue. Most of the rhetoric has been about, let\u2019s produce more. Well, we can produce more, and I\u2019m committed to that, but the fact is, we only have 2 to 3 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves; we use 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil. We can\u2019t drill our way out of this problem.\n\n\n\nWhat we can do that we\u2019ve already done administratively is increase fuel-efficiency standards on cars, just to take one example. That will save us millions of barrels of oil, just by using existing technologies and saying to car companies, you can do better than 10 miles a gallon or 15 miles a gallon. And you\u2019re starting to see Detroit respond. U.S. car companies have figured out, you know what, if we produce high-quality electric vehicles, if we produce high-quality low gas -- or high gas mileage vehicles, those will sell.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re actually starting to see market share increase for American cars in subcompact and compact cars for the first time in many years. And that\u2019s partly because we increased fuel-efficiency standards through an administrative agreement. It\u2019s also because, as part of the deal to bail out the oil companies, we said to them, start focusing on the cars of the future instead of looking at big gas guzzlers of the past.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So all of our questions now are coming in real time -- this one less than 10 minutes ago, and surfaced from a curator: \"So will you raise taxes on the middle class at least to President George W. Bush levels?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s make permanent the Bush tax cuts for low and moderate income folks -- people in -- for the 98 percent of people who, frankly, have not seen their wages go up or their incomes go up over the last decade. They don\u2019t have a lot of room; they\u2019re already struggling to meet the rising cost of health care and education and gas prices and food prices.\n\n\n\nIf all we do is just go back to the pre-Bush tax cut rates for the top income brackets, for millionaires and billionaires, that would raise hundreds of billions of dollars. And if you combine it with the cuts we\u2019ve already proposed, we could solve our deficit and our debt problems.\n\n\n\nThis is not something that requires radical solutions. It requires some smart, common-sense, balanced approaches. I think that\u2019s what the American people are looking for and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve proposed. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep on trying to bring the parties together to agree to, is a balanced approach that has more cuts than revenue, but has some revenue, and that revenue should come from the people who can most afford it.\n\n\n\nQ So a slight deviation from the economy -- we have a lot of questions, and this will be our last before we start reading some responses to your question -- about the space program. And this one from Ron: \"Now that the space shuttle is gone, where does America stand in space exploration?\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We are still a leader in space exploration. But, frankly, I have been pushing NASA to revamp its vision. The shuttle did some extraordinary work in low-orbit experiments, the International Space Station, moving cargo. It was an extraordinary accomplishment and we\u2019re very proud of the work that it did. But now what we need is that next technological breakthrough.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re still using the same models for space travel that we used with the Apollo program 30, 40 years ago. And so what we\u2019ve said is, rather than keep on doing the same thing, let\u2019s invest in basic research around new technologies that can get us places faster, allow human space flight to last longer.\n\n\n\nAnd what you\u2019re seeing now is NASA I think redefining its mission. And we\u2019ve set a goal to let\u2019s ultimately get to Mars. A good pit stop is an asteroid. I haven\u2019t actually -- we haven\u2019t identified the actual asteroid yet, in case people are wondering. (Laughter.) But the point is, let\u2019s start stretching the boundaries so we\u2019re not doing the same thing over and over again, but rather let\u2019s start thinking about what\u2019s the next horizon, what\u2019s the next frontier out there.\n\n\n\nBut in order to do that, we\u2019re actually going to need some technological breakthroughs that we don\u2019t have yet. And what we can do is for some of this low-orbit stuff, some of the more routine space travel -- obviously no space travel is routine, but it could become more routine over time -- let\u2019s allow the private sector to get in so that they can, for example, send these low-Earth orbit vehicles into space and we may be able to achieve a point in time where those of you who are just dying to go into space, you can buy a ticket, and a private carrier can potentially take you up there, while the government focuses on the big breakthroughs that require much larger investments and involve much greater risk.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So, Mr. President, we received a lot of responses to your question over the last hour. And we wanted to go through seven of them that we picked out and just spend some time giving feedback on each. This one from Brian: \"Cut defense contracting, end war on drugs, eliminate agribiz and big oil subsidies, invest in public campaign financing.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s not a bad list. (Laughter.) The defense contracting is something we\u2019re already making progress on.\n\n\n\nI think with respect to the war on drugs, what we\u2019ve always said is that investing in prevention, reducing demand, is going to be the most cost-effective thing that we can do. We still have to interdict the big drug kingpins and we still have to enforce our drug laws. But making sure that we\u2019re spending more on prevention and treatment can make a huge difference.\n\n\n\nWith respect to some of these big agribusiness and big oil subsidies, those are the examples of the kinds of loopholes we can close. And public campaign financing is something that I\u2019ve supported in the past. There is no doubt that money has an impact on what happens here in Washington. And the more we can reduce money\u2019s impact on Washington, the better off we\u2019re going to be.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: Our next response from Elizabeth in Chicago: \u201cStop giving money to countries that waste it -- Pakistan. Keep military, share the wealth between branches, and don\u2019t cut education.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know, the one thing I would say is, on the notion of giving money to countries that waste it -- and Pakistan is listed there -- I think it\u2019s important for people to know that foreign aid accounts for less than 2 percent of our budget. And if you defined it just narrowly as the kind of foreign aid to help feed people and what we think of classically as foreign aid, it\u2019s probably closer to 1 percent.\n\n\n\nSo sometimes people have an exaggerated sense that we spend 25 percent of the federal budget on foreign aid. It\u2019s a tiny amount that has a big impact. And I think America, to be a leader in the world, to have influence, to help stabilize countries and create opportunity for people so that they don\u2019t breed terrorists or create huge refugee flows and so forth, it\u2019s smart for us to make a very modest investment in foreign aid. It\u2019s a force multiplier and it\u2019s something that even in tough fiscal times America needs to continue to do as part of our role as a global leader.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: This next one is pretty simple, from Daniel: \u201cWe need to raise taxes, period.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: As I said before, if wealthy individuals are willing to simply go back to the rates that existed back in the 1990s when rich people were doing very well -- it\u2019s not like they were poor -- and by the way, that\u2019s when we saw the highest job growth rates and that\u2019s when we saw the highest -- the greatest reduction in poverty, and that\u2019s when we saw businesses very profitable -- if the wealthiest among us -- and I include myself in this category -- are willing to give up a little bit more, then we can solve this problem. It does not take a lot.\n\n\n\nAnd I just have to say, when people say, job-killing tax increases, that\u2019s what Obama is proposing, we\u2019re not going to -- you\u2019re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. And the facts are that a modest increase for wealthy individuals is not shown to have an adverse impact on job growth.\n\n\n\nI mean, we can test the two theories. You had what happened during the \u201890s -- right? Taxes for wealthy individuals were somewhat higher, businesses boomed, the economy boomed, great job growth. And then the 2000s, when taxes were cut on wealthy individuals, jobs didn\u2019t grow as fast, businesses didn\u2019t grow as fast. I mean, it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t tried what these other folks are pitching. It didn\u2019t work. And we should go with what works.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: So our next response -- we have about nine minutes left and four more responses -- this one from Tammy: \u201cCut military spending on oil subsidies and keep education investments.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I agree with this. The one thing I\u2019ll say about military spending -- we\u2019ve ended the war in Iraq, our combat mission there, and our -- all our troops are slated to be out by the end of this year. We\u2019ve already removed 100,000. I announced that we were going to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan and pivot to a transition process where Afghans are taking more responsibility for their defense.\n\n\n\nBut we have to do all of this in a fairly gradual way. We can\u2019t simply lop off 25 percent off the defense budget overnight. We have to think about all the obligations we have to our current troops who are in the field, and making sure they\u2019re properly equipped and safe. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we are meeting our commitments for those veterans who are coming home. We\u2019ve got to make sure that -- in some cases, we\u2019ve got outdated equipment that needs to be replaced.\n\n\n\nAnd so I\u2019m committed to reducing the defense budget, but as Commander-in-Chief, one of the things that we have to do is make sure that we do it in a thoughtful way that\u2019s guided by our security and our strategic needs. And I think we can accomplish that. And the nice thing about the defense budget is it\u2019s so big, it\u2019s so huge, that a 1 percent reduction is the equivalent of the education budget. Not -- I\u2019m exaggerating, but it\u2019s so big that you can make relatively modest changes to defense that end up giving you a lot of head room to fund things like basic research or student loans or things like that.\n\n\n\nQ Our next response from southwest Ohio, Mostlymoderate: \u201cCut subsidies to industries which are no longer in crisis or are unsuccessful, cotton, oil, corn subsidies from ethanol.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there\u2019s been a interesting debate taking place in Congress recently. I\u2019m a big supporter of biofuels. But one of the things that's become clear is, is that we need to accelerate our basic research in ethanol and other biofuels that are made from things like woodchips and algae as opposed to just focusing on corn, which is probably the least efficient energy producer of these various other approaches.\n\n\n\nAnd so I think that it\u2019s important for even those folks in farm states who traditionally have been strong supporters of ethanol to examine are we, in fact, going after the cutting-edge biodiesel and ethanol approaches that allow, for example, Brazil to run about a third of its transportation system on biofuels. Now, they get it from sugar cane and it\u2019s a more efficient conversion process than corn-based ethanol. And so us doing more basic research in finding better ways to do the same concept I think is the right way to go.\n\n\n\nQ I believe you addressed this next one, so we\u2019re going to skip past it.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I did.\n\n\n\nQ But from Ryan: \u201cI would cut defense spending.\u201d\n\n\n\nQ And James: \u201cI\u2019d cut costs by cutting some welfare programs. People will never try harder when they are handed everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, here\u2019s what I would say. I think we should acknowledge that some welfare programs in the past were not well-designed and in some cases did encourage dependency. And as somebody who worked in low-income neighborhoods, I\u2019ve seen it, where people weren\u2019t encouraged to work, weren\u2019t encouraged to upgrade their skills, were just getting a check, and over time their motivation started to diminish. And I think even if you\u2019re progressive, you\u2019ve got to acknowledge that some of these things have not been well-designed.\n\n\n\nI will say that today, welfare payments are not the big driver of our deficit or our debt. There are work obligations attached to welfare, that the vast majority of folks who are getting welfare want to work but can\u2019t find jobs. And what we should be doing is in all our social programs evaluating what are upgrading people\u2019s skills, giving them the tools they need to get into the workforce, nudging them into the workforce but letting them know that we\u2019re there to support you and encourage you as long as you\u2019re showing the kind of responsibility for being willing to work that every American should be expected to show.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m somebody who believes that we can constantly improve any program, whether it\u2019s a defense program -- those who say that we can\u2019t cut military at all, they haven\u2019t spent a lot of time looking at military budgets. Those who say that we can\u2019t make any changes to our social welfare programs or else you\u2019re being mean to poor people, that\u2019s not true. There are some programs that can always be improved. And some programs, if they don\u2019t work, we should have the courage to eliminate them, and then use that money to put it into the programs that do work.\n\n\n\nBut the bottom line is that our core values of responsibility, opportunity, making sure that the American Dream is alive and well so that anybody who is willing to put in the time and the effort and the energy are able to get a good education in this society, find a job that pays a living wage, that they\u2019re able to send their kids to college without going broke, that they\u2019ve got basic health care, they\u2019re going to be able to retire with some dignity and some respect, that that opportunity is open to anybody regardless of race or religion or sexual orientation -- that that basic principle, that\u2019s what holds us together. That\u2019s what makes us Americans.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not all tied together by ethnicity or a single religion. What ties us together is this idea that everybody has got a shot. As long as you carry out your responsibilities, you can make it. You can get into the middle class and beyond. And you can start a company and suddenly help bring the whole world together. That\u2019s what makes this country outstanding.\n\n\n\nBut in order to do that, it requires us to both have a commitment to our individualism and our freedom and our creativity and our idiosyncrasies. But it also requires us to have a commitment to each other, and recognize that I would not be President if somebody hadn\u2019t helped provide some scholarships for my school, and you would not have Twitter if the Department of Defense, at some point, and a bunch of universities hadn\u2019t made some investments in something that ended up being the Internet. And those were public goods that were invested in.\n\n\n\nSo you and I are sitting here because somebody, somewhere, made an investment in our futures. We\u2019ve got the same obligation for the folks who are coming up behind us. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re looking out for them, just like the previous generations looked out for us. And that\u2019s what I think will help us get through what are some difficult times and make sure that America\u2019s future is even brighter than the past.\n\n\n\nMR. DORSEY: And on that note, thank you very much, Mr. President. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. (Applause.) All right, thank you, guys. Thanks.

{"article": "With Americans demanding a new way forward in Washington, House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) uses the Weekly Republican Address to outline solutions for ending economic uncertainty, stopping government\u2019s spending binge, and changing the way Congress does business. In the address, Boehner notes that this is a new approach that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington \u2013 by either party \u2013 and it is at the core of the Pledge to America, a governing agenda Republicans built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\nLeader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of Boehner\u2019s remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m John Boehner.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to \u2018change this country and change the world.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about the world, but here at home, Americans haven\u2019t experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese problems didn\u2019t start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A \u2018stimulus\u2019 spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmericans are demanding a new way forward in Washington \u2013 an approach that neither party has tried.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cA generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, we\u2019re now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis spending spree threatens our children\u2019s future. It\u2019s also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. We\u2019re ready to cut spending to pre-\u2018stimulus,\u2019 pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And we\u2019re ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to stop the coming tax hike. We can\u2019t balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth \u2013 and we won\u2019t have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that\u2019s change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them \u2013 something they didn\u2019t get when the \u2018stimulus\u2019 was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called \u2018comprehensive\u2019 bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view \u2013 not written in the Speaker\u2019s office, behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\u201cAcross our nation, Americans are looking at President Obama\u2019s policies and asking \u2013 \u2018where are the jobs?\u2019 To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending \u2013 and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a new way forward that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington yet. It\u2019s a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, it\u2019s also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried it President Obama\u2019s way. We\u2019ve tried it Washington\u2019s way. It hasn\u2019t worked. It\u2019s time to put the people back in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your time and may God bless the United States of America.\"", "comment_3": "Weekly address: Biden and federal judge blast Republican Senate for leaving SCOTUS vacancy open https://t.co/YfSBdWvZUx", "comment_2": ".@PatToomey delivered this week's Republican Weekly address on Kate's Law &amp; the Stop Sanctuary Policies Act \u2192 https://t.co/F5dWFH6StM #PASEN", "comment_1": "Weekly Republican Address: This Is A Better Way https://t.co/HbaBceyqKi via @YouTube", "target": "real"}

{"article": "(Sundays: 885-4200)\n\nMR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, the president signs financial regulation this week as part of what the administration calls \" recovery summer.\" But where are the jobs? The Fed chief says the future is uncertain. Will things get worse before they get better? Plus, how Washington 's debate about your taxes will affect economic growth . It's all part of my one-on- one discussion this morning with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . Then, the rush to judge Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod .\n\nSEC'Y TOM VILSACK: This is a good woman. She's been put through hell. And I could have done and should have done a better job.\n\nMR. ROBERT GIBBS: How did we not ask the right questions? How did you all not ask the right questions? How did other people not ask the right questions?\n\nMR. GREGORY: What does this episode say about racially-charged politics, the media , and the post-racial presidency of Barack Obama ? Our roundtable weighs in: president of the National Urban League , Marc Morial ; former White House adviser Anita Dunn ; a man often credited with helping to spark the tea party movement, CNBC 's Rick Santelli ; New York Times columnist David Brooks ; and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne .\n\nAnnouncer: From NBC News in Washington , MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Good morning. A summer of anxiety over jobs, the economy , and government borrowing as new polling this week shows President Obama 's job approval rating, handling the nation 's economy , at a new low. On Friday I sat down with the administration 's top economic official, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner . Mr. Secretary, welcome back to the program. Thank you for having us down to your office.\n\nSEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER: Good to see you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: I want to ask you about some of the broader economic outlooks that we've heard across the, the spectrum this week, an important one from the Fed chairman, Bernanke , who said this week the outlook is \"unusually uncertain.\" And I wonder if, to you, to the president, that means you fear that things are going to get worse before they get better?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I don't think there's anything unusual about the fact that given the severity of this crisis , this recession , given how bad it was just 18 months ago, that Americans are still living with some caution, some sense of caution about the future . I think that's natural, unavoidable. But, you know, the economy 's now been growing for almost a year, little more than a year. Private sector 's creating jobs again. The economy is starting to heal again. You're seeing growth. Manufacturing, private investment have recovered. Those are encouraging signs. But we're living still with a lot of challenge still because the scars of this crisis ran so deep. And I think most Americans understand it's going to take some time to heal this.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But \"unusually uncertain.\" There's the prospect of a double-dip recession . There are economists who've said you don't normally see this kind of anemic pace of recovery once a recovery begins.\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I, I think I disagree slightly in the sense that, you know, remember, this was a recession caused by a set of policies that left us with a $1.3 trillion deficit when the president came into office, an economy that was falling off the cliff. Millions of Americans had already lost their jobs. The recession was a year old at that point. And given that we've been living beyond our means as a country , Americans have been borrowing too much, and you had a huge growth in risk taking and leverage in the financial system , what you would expect is a more moderate pace for recovery than is typical. And that's what we're seeing. But again, you are seeing recovery . You're seeing private investment expand again, job growth starting to come back, and that's very encouraging. And if you look at what private forecasters say about the economy , they see an economy that's going to continue to grow, strengthen moderately over the next 18 months or so. And I talked to businesses across the country , and I would say that is the general view, an economy that is gradually getting better.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So just to be precise, you do not believe in a double-dip recession , that it will get worse before it gets better?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: No, I don't. I think the most likely thing is, you see an economy that gradually strengthens over the next year or two, you see job growth start to come back again. Again, investments expanding, manufacturing's getting a little stronger, export's better. Those are very encouraging signs. But we got a long way to go still.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You see this magazine I have, The Week , and, and the headline is \"Where are the jobs? The recession is over, but no one is hiring.\" Why is particularly private sector hiring apparently so slow?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: They're -- I think businesses across the country , you know, again, faced with the prospect of an economy falling off the cliff, are still cautious, still very cautious. So they've been trying to get as much productivity out of their employees as possible. They're in a very strong financial conditions, though, and I think that's very promising, because there's a lot of pent-up demand and there's a lot of capacity still for them to step up and start to invest and hire again. But you're seeing it start. You know, we've had six months of private sector job growth . Not as fast as we like, not as fast as we need, but I think you're going to see it, again, gradually start to get better.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But why are, why are businesses uncertain? Is it what's happened in Europe , in Greece , and in other places? I mean, in other words, businesses are making money , they've got cash, but they don't seem to want to invest it yet.\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: They are. Again, most important cause, I think, is the scars caused by the depth of the crisis , what that did to confidence. You're right, though, to mention Europe. You know, when people got very worried about Europe in the spring, it did hurt confidence. You saw equity prices fall around the world, and that, that absolutely had an effect. That in -- produced a little more caution. But that, I believe, is a temporary factor. Europe 's moved very aggressively. And they're starting to get more confidence back in Europe that they, they have some traction on policies , and they're going to be able to put this behind them.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But you still have both the political and the economic reality of this\n\nheadline: \"Where are the jobs?\" And the both political and economic reality is that most Americans , based on a variety of polling, do not believe the administration 's claim that the stimulus had made things better rather than left things largely unchanged. And the criticism is, primarily from the left, that the stimulus was never big enough to really match up to the severity of the crisis . So why not stimulate more? Why not spend more to do something to create more jobs?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: There's a lot of stimulus still in the pipeline. You saw Congress move this week to expand unemployment benefits . The Senate is about to consider a very powerful package of, of tax cuts for small businesses , help small businesses get access to credit . That's very important. And we think there's some more things Congress can do to, again, to help reinforce this recovery . But we're in a transition, David , from the extraordinary actions the government had to take to break the back of this financial crisis to a recovery led by private demand. That transition is well under way. It's going to continue, it's going to strengthen.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So you're not prepared to say that more public works government spending is necessary?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: Well, I -- we've got a lot of challenges less -- left as a country still ahead of us. We have very high rates of unemployment, very high levels of long-term unemployed. We want to make sure we're strengthening the competitiveness of American companies across industries. And we've got some long-term fiscal problems that are going to be a challenge for us as a country . And we're going to work to fix those problems we inherited, but the best way to do that is to make sure we're growing, private investment starts to come back, private firms start to hire again. The government can help, but we need to make this transition now to a recovery led by private investment , private...\n\nMR. GREGORY: And that's an important statement.\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: It is.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You're saying that, indeed, government should take its foot off the accelerator of stimulus .\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: You know, we have already moved very aggressively to unwind and walk back the emergency measures we had to put in place in the financial sector . Those were very effective, bringing down the cost of borrowing, we brought a lot of private capital in. So that was the right thing to do then. We've dialed those back very quickly. Right now we still think there's a good case for the government acting with targeted measures to help small businesses and help the unemployed, help states keep teachers in the classroom. Those are sensible, good steps. But we have to make this transition to a recovery led by private companies .\n\nMR. GREGORY: You talked about extending benefits to the unemployed. When the president did that back in November of last year, he trumpeted the fact that it was paid for, that it wouldn't add to the deficit . And yet the complaint from Republicans this time is no such promise here. This will add to the deficit . Why was it important then to make sure it was paid for, but not now?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I think this is a responsible way to do it. You know, my job, David , is to help make sure we can borrow to finance the obligations that Congress gives us. And I think it's a prudent, responsible way, given the scale of the emergency, the scale of the damage still facing America , that we finance these additional support for the unemployed as well as the support for small business . We think there's a good case for doing it now. We want to do it in an overall fiscally responsible way. And, as you know, the president has proposed a series of measures that will cut our deficits in half over the next several years. That's important, too, for future growth. We're going to need to make sure we get that balance right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But again, it was important to be paid for then, but not now?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: David , we can afford to do it this way. I'm completely confident we can. And if you look, again, at what we're paying to borrow now, we've got very low interest rates as a country , in part because people around the world and Americans have a lot of confidence in our capacity as a country to make sure we manage through these challenges.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Indeed, that's the argument that is cited by those who say that government should spend more, because the cost of borrowing right now -- there's all this debate about stimulus vs. the debt. A lot of people saying government spending 's out of control. But you just made the point, it doesn't cost a lot to carry the debt right now. Why not spend more to create jobs when they don't appear to be materializing from the private sector ?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: It's a difficult balance. Again, we are proposing to make sure we're extending tax cuts that go to 95 percent of Americans . We extend a bunch of tax incentives to businesses to help encourage hiring, investment . We think those are sensible, affordable steps. We can, we can afford to do that now. But we have to make some choices, too, and we have to make sure we can continue to earn confidence around the world that we're going to have the will as a country to bring these large inherited deficits down over time to a much more manageable level.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me talk about the achievement of financial reform legislation that you've worked so hard on. The, the pay czar, Ken Feinberg , has been working on compensation, just issued a new report saying that, at the height of the crisis , you had some of the biggest banks paying bonuses that were not warranted. Do you have any way to get any of that money back?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: You know, he spoke to that earlier. Congress did not give him the authority to do that. But they did give him authority he used very effectively to change how Wall Street was paying its executives, and he did an enormously important job in trying to make sure that we have in place ways to make sure these guys don't go back in the future -- don't go in the future back to paying executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the economy . He did a great job, limited authority, but he used that authority very well.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The, the issue is, are we fighting the last war in financial reform ? To what extent do you look at this regime of new regulation and say, \"Well, there's still a wait-and-see aspect to this in terms of whether it could really do the job the next time, because we don't know what the next time's going to look like.\"\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: We don't. And that, that's the basic strategy that is reflected in this bill. The best way to make sure we're protecting a financial system from future crisis -- we won't know the source, we won't be able to anticipate pre-empt all those crisis -- is to make sure the system runs with much thicker shock absorbers, much larger cushions, financial resources against loss, much stronger capital buffers so that they can withstand the kind of shock losses you'd face in a recession like this. That's the most effective thing you can do, and this reform bill gives the government authority it did not have to make sure the system runs with these much more conservative constraints on risk taking.\n\nMR. GREGORY: As someone's who concerned about the overall growth of the economy , the role of education, innovation, manufacturing, does it trouble you that 25 percent of our economy is the financial sector , which doesn't actually make anything besides money?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I don't know what -- how large the system 's going to be in the future . You can't really tell. But what we're determined to do, and what the reforms will do is to make sure this system goes back to its core purpose of taking the savings of Americans and from investors around the world and allocating those to people with an idea, not just the largest companies in the country , but to small businesses with an idea and a plan for growing. That's what systems have to do well. Our system , at its best, was the model for the world in doing that, and these reforms will make sure we preserve that basic strength.\n\nMR. GREGORY: A couple of questions about housing and taxes . The housing market is still in a lot of trouble. It was propped up with mortgage modification, with the, the tax benefits of buying new home. That's now gone. Home sales have gone back down. Modifications have not worked, there still -- has not met the goal of avoiding four million foreclosures. I'm curious to know whether the president and you are committed to three critical areas -- the tax credit for mortgage interest, the credit provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the housing goals, particularly for low-income Americas -- Americans . Are you still committed to those three pillars?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I'll say the two things that guide us going forward now. One is we want to make sure that we do what is necessary to make sure Americans have the ability to borrow , to finance the purchase of a house . And we bring stability to house prices , we help repair the huge damage done by the housing market . And as you -- you still say, it's still, you know, in a lot of distress. But we've brought a measure of stability to house prices , interest rates have come down dramatically, millions of Americans have been able to refinance, take advantage of lower rates, which is much more money in their pockets. And we put in place a very carefully designed mortgage-modification program to help people who have a chance to stay in their house take advantage of that chance. Now, we're going to make sure we continue to do what's necessary to, again, repair the damage of this housing crisis . But we have to reform the system . We have to bring to Fannie and Freddie , to the GSEs , and to the broader housing finance market a better set of policies to make sure we can deliver affordable finance for housing without leaving the economy vulnerable to this kind of crisis .\n\nMR. GREGORY: But the housing goals, because that's a big part of what Fannie and Freddie were doing, of course. Again, they, they guarantee most of the debt, the mortgage debt that's out there in the country .\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: They do.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And the government has now taken them over and they were private heretofore. But it is a goal of getting people into homes, is that still the goal? Because that's part of the problem , right? You had too many people in homes that couldn't afford to be there?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: David , I -- we're going to take a careful look at a set of reforms that are going to be good for the country going forward and don't leave us vulnerable to this kind of crisis in the future . I personally believe that there's going to be a good case for the government preserving some type of guarantee to make sure that people have the ability to borrow to finance a house even in a very damaging recession . I think there's going to be a good case for that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So Fannie and Freddie should not be dismantled?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: No, that's, that's different.\n\nMR. GREGORY: That's different.\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I think we're not going to preserve Fannie and Freddie in anything like their current form. We're going to have to bring fundamental change to that market. But I think there's going to be a good case for taking a look at a preserving or putting in place a carefully designed guarantee so, again, homeowners have the ability to borrow to finance a home even in a very difficult recession . But we're also going to have to take a look at the broad set of policies we put in place to help encourage home ownership and particularly help low-income Americans get access to affordable housing . We're going to take a very broad look at, at, at how to best to do that. We're going to begin that process very quickly, consult broadly. And I think that there's going to be very broad support among Republicans and Democrats for a set of sensible reforms to fix this system .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me go through as quickly as I can some of the big tax issues. The Bush tax cuts set to expire, the administration 's plan is let them expire, in other, in other words, raise taxes on wealthy Americans above 250,000, but don't let them expire, keep them going for those $250,000 or less. Even Democrats , like the chairman of the budget Committee , says bad idea to raise taxes on wealthy Americans until you've got a recovery on sounder footing. Any wiggle room on that? Any prospect of change ?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I, I, I don't, I don't think it's quite a fair description of Senator Conrad 's views. But I won't speak to them. But I'll say what the president believes, and I believe this, is the right thing for the country , the fair thing, the responsible thing for the country now is to make sure we leave in place and preserve tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and complement those with a set of incentives for businesses to expand and hire. To make that possible, and to do that responsibly, I think it is fair and good policy to allow those tax cuts that only go to 2 to 3 percent of the highest earners in the country to expire as scheduled. The country can withstand that. The economy can withstand that. I think it's good policy.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Would you like to see the capital gains tax stay at 20 percent?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I would.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And so you'll push for that?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: Yeah. And, and we don't want to see the rate of dividends exceed that either because, again, we want to make sure we have policies in place overall across the economy that's going to make sure we're encouraging investment , encouraging growth as this economy recovers.\n\nMR. GREGORY: If deficits are unsustainable, can you give an example yet of a painful choice that the president's prepared to make to bring our fiscal house in order?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. I mean, again, he's proposed to freeze discretionary spending , to keep the overall size of the government at a very modest level as a share of our economy . If you look again at what the president's proposing, he keeps the overall size of government at a very modest level comparable to -- lower than what was in the Bush administration , comparable to what President Reagan presided over. That's very important. That is a difficult thing to do when we face so many challenges as a country . But he's also proposing, as you, as you said, David , to allow these tax cuts for the highest earners to expire on schedule. He's proposed to reinstate a bunch of disciplines that helped produce the large surpluses of the Clinton era. Now -- and those, those policies will bring our deficits down by more than half over the next several years.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Final question. The president talked about the fact that, like a lot of Americans who are saving for their kids educations, his 529, or college savings plan for his daughters has gone down in value. A lot of people think about...\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: Well, it's come up dramatically...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Come up -- all right, but it's still...\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...from his first few months in office.\n\nMR. GREGORY: OK. Yeah, right. But this is a serious point because a lot of people think about this and about investing in the market for the future , as you've passed financial regulation . What is a fair expectation for Americans to have out of the capital markets , if they see that as a place for savings, when for so many years we've heard, \"Hey, you'll get 10 to 15 percent returns over the long-term.\" Is that what Americans can really expect?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I think what they can expect from these reforms is much more accessible, much more simple, much clearer disclosure about the terms in which they can borrow to finance education for their children, borrow to finance a home, borrow to finance a car, take a credit card . Much more clear, transparent, simple disclosure than they had over the past several decades, and much better information about the risks you take in investing. That's a sensible thing for the government to do. Now, of course, you need people to be able to make responsible decisions. We can't make those decisions for those individuals. They've got to take that responsibility themselves.\n\nMR. GREGORY: But hasn't the world fundamentally changed in the markets that you simply cannot expect to get the kind of return on investment that you've enjoyed and so many Americans have enjoyed for so many years?\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: I think it's hard to know. What you want people doing is making better decisions, more careful decisions about how much of their income they spend, how much of their income they save, what they use those savings for, how much they borrow . And I think the trauma caused by this crisis is going to be profound and long-lasting, and you're already seeing it induce, I think, an ultimately healthy and necessary change in behavior because people are already saving more of their income, and I think that's going to be a good thing for the country .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Secretary Geithner , thank you.\n\nSEC'Y GEITHNER: Nice to see you, David .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And coming up next, the rush to judge Shirley Sherrod . What happened and why? The politics of race in what many thought would be a post-racial era. Our roundtable\n\nweighs in: the National Urban League 's Marc Morial ; former White House adviser Anita Dunn ; CNBC 's Rick Santelli ; David Brooks of The New York Times ; and The Washington Post 's E.J. Dionne , right here only on MEET THE PRESS .\n\nMR. GREGORY: Coming up, the fallout from the firing. What does Shirley Sherrod 's dismissal tell us about race, politics and the media ? After this brief commercial break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: And we are back. Shirley Sherrod , the agriculture official wrongly accused of harboring racist views and fired based on those accusations, became an unlikely household name this week. There is plenty of blame to go around for this episode, and we will discuss that\n\nin just a moment. But one question hung in the air this week: Weren't discussions about race supposed to get better in the Obama era? It was during the presidential campaign of 2008 that Senator Obama set an example for how to discuss race. He had to explain controversial remarks his former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright , made from the pulpit. Obama 's point: You have to put someone views in the context of their life experience.\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA: Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Ironically, that is exactly what Sherrod was trying to say in the speech that was edited to make her sound like a racist. Her point was that she once held prejudices but found a way to overcome them and help a white farmer in need.\n\nMS. SHIRLEY SHERROD: This whole incident helped me to feel a little more that we seem to be going backwards instead of forward in terms of race relations .\n\nMR. GREGORY: A teachable moment?\n\nMR. ROBERT GIBBS: I think a teachable moment is a moment in which the facts change and you react to the different -- those different facts . I think this is one of those moments, and I think that's what's happening.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Still, this was not the kind of Internet and cable news-fed spectacle the White House wanted to see, let alone be part of while it's trying to get Americans back to work and while the president was signing a major piece of financial reform legislation. And it wasn't the first time the White House has been thrown off track. One year ago, another racially charged incident, after the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr ., the president reacted.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry. Number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And then later expressed regret for a poor choice of words, he said, and for ratcheting up the controversy. Then there was a summit over a beer. What now? Change comes slowly, observers say, and only if moments like this are used to teach.\n\nFMR. REP. KWEISI MFUME (D-MD): We measure race relations in baby steps, not giant steps . And that's why it's taken us 300 years of slavery and a hundred years of Jim Crow to get beyond it and to get to where we are.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Back in 2008 , Senator Obama was humble about how his election might\n\nimpact race in America, but he was adamant about one thing: But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: And yet, if we're not ignoring it, the question is, are we talking about it in a way that anyone would think is actually constructive? I'm going to pose that question to the roundtable. Joining me now to discuss all the angles of this, as well as the entire political landscape as well, former Obama White House adviser Anita Dunn ; CNBC 's Rick Santelli ; the National Urban League 's Marc Morial ; The Washington Post 's E.J. Dionne ; and David Brooks of The New York Times. Welcome to all of you.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Nice to be back.\n\nMR. MARC MORIAL: Marc Morial , this was, as, as the conversation about race always is, became emotional, politically charged, and it happened in a heartbeat. So to my question, are we better off for this experience? Are we having a constructive conversation about race in America ?\n\nMR. GREGORY: If we take the proper, positive steps coming out of this experience, we can be better off. There are three things I observed. One, don't forget that this started when Mr. Breitbart threw a firecracker in a crowded room.\n\nMR. MORIAL: This is, this is the conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart .\n\nMR. GREGORY: He threw a firecracker in a crowded room. He yelled \"fire\" in a crowded theater and doctored a video, which caused an innocent, hard-working, responsible woman, whose story was of racial reconciliation , to be cast in a negative light. And then it began from there. So that's certainly an important takeaway. The second important takeaway is the story of Shirley Sherrod and the Spooners , and that is a story of reconciliation . It's a story of people who came to respect each other. It's a woman who was willing to admit that she had some animus and that she worked to overcome it. And third thing, I'd say, David , is this week in Washington , the Urban League 's going to have 10,000 people here for our centennial conference , we're going to have a constructive discussion about race and education, race and jobs, race and health care, a constructive discussion . And I 'd invite people to follow that discussion this week.\n\nMR. MORIAL: And the president will be speaking there, right?\n\nMR. GREGORY: The president will be there. Secretary Duncan will be there. We have Tim Kaine and Michael Steele . We've got business leaders. We've got a bit of a mix across the spectrum who'll be there to talk positively about the pressing issues that face the country .\n\nMR. MORIAL: Anita Dunn , you worked in the White House ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. ANITA DUNN: ...as an adviser on communications matters, and I want to get your response to Maureen Dowd 's column in The New York Times. ..\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yes.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...this morning, because she's got some sharp words quoting the African- American Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina . Put a portion of it up on the screen. \"`I don't think a single black person was consulted before Shirley Sherrod was fired I mean, c'mon,' said Congressman Clyburn of South Carolina . ... `The president's getting hurt real bad,' Clyburn told me. `He needs some black people around him.' He said Obama 's inner circle keeps `screwing up' on race: `Some people over there are not sensitive at all about race. They really feel that the extent to which he allows himself to talk about race would tend to pigeonhole him or cost him support, when a lot of people saw his election as a way to get the' idea `behind us. I don't think people elected him to disengage on race. Just the opposite.' ... The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give her a new job: Director of Black Outreach .\" The \" White House needs one.\" Those are strong words.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Those are strong words, David . I think that there are a lot of people who look back at the last week and wish they had behaved very differently. I think there are plenty of people in the news media who wish that they had stopped and thought about kind of the fundamental job of journalism before they started asking for reaction to something that wasn't their -- based on their original reporting. I think that the NAACP wishes that they had not moved as quickly as they did, and I don't think anybody is saying that the NAACP , you know, needs more African-Americans . And heaven knows that Tom Vilsack , who has taken responsibility and who has said how badly he screwed up, and the White House , which knows how badly they screwed up, have moved. But I think there are a couple of things here. One is that this extraordinary screw-up happened, and it was bad. The White House and Vilsack moved quite quickly to fix it. And I think that's what people need to do when they make mistakes. I think that the broader question, though, which is, you know, how is this suddenly Barack Obama 's problem ? He has written an entire book about race. In his book \" Audacity of Hope ,\" he devotes an entire chapter. He made the speech in 2008 . He has probably spoken more to this issue...\n\nMS. DUNN: But there's a skittishness...\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...and thought more about this issue...\n\nMS. DUNN: But what Clyburn is getting at is a skittishness about really confronting problems when they are -- you know, when they spring up like this, however -- whether there were screw-ups made, to deal with them head-on.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Well, you know, David , it's funny to me because I think that so much of this resulted from what was kind of a false metanarrative that was developing last week. As you recall, I mean, you know, you talked about context , and the president's talked about context .\n\nMS. DUNN: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The context for this was not just that Andrew Breitbart decided to edit -- to put an edited video to make a point. He was trying to make the point that the NAACP is a racist organization. So let's start with that kind of fun, fun box here. Then, the week before that, the NAACP had had a resolution, OK, that's called on the tea party movement to expel from its midst anybody who harbors racist sentiments.\n\nMS. DUNN: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The tea party movement came back and said, \"That makes the NAACP racist. They're being racist towards us.\"\n\nMS. DUNN: All right, and this is the broader context . E.J., let me...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But this is the broader context , OK?\n\nMS. DUNN: Right. Let me bring you into this, E.J. , because you wrote in a column this\n\nMR. GREGORY: the bludgeoning of mainstream journalism into looking timorously over its right shoulder and believing that `balance' demands taking seriously whatever sludge the far right is pumping into the political waters.\" What do we take from this?\n\nweek, \"Yet the Obama team was reacting to a reality: Well, that -- yeah, that's my column tomorrow in the Post . I mean, first of\n\nMR. E.J. DIONNE: Can we have a good discussion on race? We can't have a good discussion on race if the facts don't matter. And I think it's, it's not only that Shirley Sherrod was smeared, it was a perverse smear. Because, if you look at that speech , what she was giving is a speech about racial reconciliation . She was saying poor blacks and poor whites have a lot in common. And this was twisted into a, an allegation, false allegation that she was somehow a black racist. Now, what's going on here? I think the traditional media are so afraid of being called liberal, God forbid they be called liberal, that they are willing to run with any kind of right-wing propaganda and treat it as news. Challenging propaganda, or not running it, or taking your time before you run with a story, that's not liberalism, that's journalism. And I think that the right has been running this campaign for 30 years, they've had a lot of success, and we should worry about it. With the -- you got to look over both shoulders, and you got to look at the facts .\n\nall, you asked right at the beginning a good question: There's not only a right-wing squabble media . I mean, there's a squabble culture out there. There's regular media -- we were trained in one media . When I\n\nMR. DAVID BROOKS: If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out. And so that's it. That -- you would never run an excerpt from a speech unless you saw the speech . That's just unthinkable.\n\nstarted working in Chicago, we were given a phrase: Right.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. DUNN: So we were trained in a certain way. A different sort of media , squabble culture , has come up on the left and the right, which, which decides their -- they build audience by destroying other people. They don't know anything about policy, they don't care about government , they just want that squabble.\n\nMR. BROOKS: But...\n\nMR. GREGORY: But, but...\n\nMR. DIONNE: And my rule is -- I mean, for somebody, what Anita was doing...\n\nMR. BROOKS: Yeah.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...stay away from the squabble culture . Don't get in there. And that's true for us, and I would say that's true...\n\nMR. BROOKS: OK. Well, let me just say something really quickly. That is easier said than done when the White House press secretary walks into the room and the only question people want to ask is, \"How are you going to react? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? What are you going to do?\"\n\nMS. DUNN: Right. Rick...\n\nMR. GREGORY: And you have a false, a false fact, an edited speech , as, as E.J. says, that was designed to create this outcome that becomes \"the news of the day,\" OK?\n\nMS. DUNN: Well, then play by different rules. Maybe before firing somebody, call them up and talk to them.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Right. But, Rick...\n\nMR. GREGORY: I, I couldn't agree with you more there, OK, so.\n\nMS. DUNN: Rick Santelli , but I want to bring you into this, as well, and -- because the, the political dimension of this, you know, the NAACP making the charge against the, you know, the tea party ; the tea party in some ways responding in kind by going after Sherrod . Eugene\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"With the Obama presidency has come a flurry of charges from the likes of [ Andrew ] Breitbart but also from more substantial conservative figures -- about alleged incidences of racial discrimination against whites by blacks and other minorities. ... \"These allegations of anti- white racism are being deliberately hyped and exaggerated because they are designed to make whites fearful. It won't work with most people, of course, but it works with some enough, perhaps, to help erode Obama 's political standing and damage his party's prospects at the polls.\" That this is a political strategy.\n\nRobinson wrote this in his column, which was provocative: First of all, we should have zero tolerance for racial discrimination , period. Beyond that, if the indirect question is, \"Is the tea party racist?\" I think the real question is, \"Are there racists in the tea party ?\" And I would contend that statistically there's going to be racists in any group. I think the tea party is more a thought, more a feeling, more a philosophy than it is a party. And I think in February of '09, when I was the lightning rod for this movement in many ways, many different, diverse groups of people from all walks of life, all races, all from different areas of the socioeconomic spectrum, all intersect in an area that's philosophical. And I think the issue is fiscal responsibility . But with that there's a less spending issue. Less spending affects entitlements. And if you connect the dots, ultimately what we are -- the, the tea party seems to represent is a movement that we can control spending and we can have good strategies without negatively impacting minorities, which might be a higher proportion of some of these programs, again, affected by spending.\n\nMR. RICK SANTELLI: Marc Morial , I want to bring you in. Back to this question of what James -- Congressman Clyburn is saying, which is that there is a, a, an unwillingness by this administration and this president to engage on matters of race because of a kind of skittishness, not wanting to get too close to it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let me...\n\nMR. MORIAL: Is that fair?\n\nMR. GREGORY: I think there's two things.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Because the president said, you heard him in 2008 , we must -- we can't ignore it.\n\nMR. GREGORY: The president would benefit by a broad circle of external advisers, and maybe some internal advisers, who have the experience, particularly in the South , the contemporary experience of the civil rights movement , that could serve as a sounding board. And I think that this president would benefit and every president would benefit by having those type of people, those experiences, in his circle of advisers. The second thing I just want to say is to what Rick said, what I saw from the tea party , and this is what many of us reacted to, were the aspersions on Congressman Lewis , the aspersions on Congressman Clyburn , the awful billboard, certainly repudiated now, which compared the president of the United States , the elected leader of this great democracy, with two of the worst figures in 20th century history, Adolph Hitler and Lenin .\n\nMR. MORIAL: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And I asked myself, though, would I ever have seen a President Bush , a President Clinton , a President Nixon ever portrayed in that fashion? So sometimes what people react to is not what's stated...\n\nMR. MORIAL: Right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...but they also react to what they see.\n\nMR. MORIAL: But, but, E.J. , you made the point in a column, you said, \"Look, I mean, there, there's extremists on the left. I mean, there are, there are movements that have people who go way beyond the pale on both the left and the right.\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: I -- actually, what -- the point I made in that column was that going back in the 1960s ...\n\nMR. DIONNE: Right.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...to the 1960s , when folks were burning flags, mainstream liberals were asked to repudiate flag burning and they did.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. DUNN: Mm-hmm.\n\nMR. GREGORY: And the NAACP did not say...\n\nMR. DIONNE: Right.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...that the tea party is racist. They made a very careful statement where they were saying that there is racism in the tea party and it ought to be repudiated.\n\nMR. DIONNE: There's racism in the tea party , the Democratic Party , the Republican Party .\n\nMR. SANTELLI: No, but, but -- no, this is...\n\nMR. DIONNE: And, and...\n\nMS. DUNN: ...moral equivalence. This is not the case.\n\nMR. DIONNE: No.\n\nMS. DUNN: Look, there is a concerted conservative campaign on part of the movement, a minority of the movement...\n\nMR. DIONNE: Right.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...to use race to split people. Glenn Beck says Obama has a \"deep-seated hatred for white people .\" J. Christian Adams , a Republican activist pushing this new Black Panthers story, says the Obama Justice Department is motivated by a \"lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law.\" Now, there are people playing with this racial politics out there. I am not saying, the NAACP certainly isn't saying that this is the whole conservative movement ...\n\nMR. DIONNE: Right.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...or most of the conservative movement or most of the tea party . But it's a part of this strategy, and people should condemn it.\n\nMR. DIONNE: But the...\n\nMR. SANTELLI: There are liberals who call conservatives racist as a matter of tactics, too. That happens as well. Listen, I was out jogging. You wouldn't know it to look at me . I was out jogging in the mall. I was at a tea party rally, tea party rally. Also there was a group called the back -- Black Family Reunion , celebration of African-American culture . I watched these two groups intermingle, sitting at the same table, eating, watching concerts together. Among most of those people there was a fantastic atmosphere of just getting along on a, on a warm Sunday afternoon. And so there are people. But I was struck by a story of progress, a story of progress, that we're making some progress to this. And this whole week -- that speech was about progress. We now have a gotcha culture that punishes people that say terrible things. So I think overall it's slow, steady progress.\n\nMR. BROOKS: But can I, can I add into the mix here, in this week of this emotionally- charged discussion , came Senator Jim Webb , a Democrat, Virginia , who wrote an op-ed piece\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege ,\" the subhead, \" America still owes a debt to its black citizens, but government programs to help all ` people of color ' are unfair. They should end.\" Anita Dunn , I mean there are those even in the Democratic Party who are saying, \"Look, we have to have a real conversation about these issues.\"\n\nthat raised a lot of eyebrows. We'll put the headline on the screen: And I don't think there's anybody who's saying we shouldn't have a real conversation about these issues, but I also don't think there's anybody at this table or, frankly, most people in America , who think that an edited, two-and-a-half-minute clip that begins driving the news, that has reporters saying, \"How's the White House going to react? It's a huge problem . It's a huge problem . Are they going to fire her? What are they going to do? What are they going to do?\" That's not a reasoned conversation . I think a reasoned conversation is exactly what the president has tried to promote throughout his career and that he has said we need to have. But let's not mistake what's been going on over the past week for any kind of reasoned conversation . There was the rush to judgment on Shirley Sherrod , and now there's a new metanarrative, I think, based on another false premise , the idea that somehow Barack Obama is the problem with race relations in America or the reason we don't have a conversation . I don't think that's true either.\n\nMS. DUNN: But, you know, David , I want to say this.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Yeah.\n\nMS. DUNN: One of the things this distracts from is the news of the week that the Senate cut out $1 billion for summer jobs, but is prepared to spend $60 billion on a troop surge if -- in Afghanistan. One of the things this distracts from has been the repeated use of the filibuster to block legislation and block measures that would help the economy in urban communities, and that, to me...\n\nMR. MORIAL: Let me...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\n\nMR. SANTELLI: ...that, to me, and the persistent use of the filibuster, it being used more times in the last two years than in the previous century...\n\nMR. MORIAL: All right.\n\nMR. GREGORY: ...to stop this legislation greatly concerns me.\n\nMR. MORIAL: Quick, quick, Rick . Great. Hold the thought, though. I want to get your reaction to Jim Webb 's point in his editorial.\n\nMR. GREGORY: I don't agree that Latinos and Asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that Native Americans have not suffered discrimination in this country . I think the question is, how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and socially disadvantaged people. And it's a fair debate to have, but it also needs to be positive with facts . Look at the Latino unemployment rate . It's higher than the white rate. The black rate is higher than the Latino rate. So to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the Latino community , that affect the Native American community , most in depth, the African- American community , we've got to have the discussion that Jim Webb wants to have. We have facts , real facts , that give a picture of how life is in this nation .\n\nMR. MORIAL: All right. Rick , make your point, then I want to take a break.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Forty-one cents of every dollar this government spends in fiscal 2010 goes to pay debt. It's borrowed money. Forty-one cents of every dollar. Marcus , we have a $3 1/2 trillion 2010 budget . Let's look at that $34 billion for extension. These people need help, but to think that this administration -- and in Timothy Geithner 's interview, he talks about getting their fiscal house in order. In a $3 1/2 trillion budget , they can't come up with a way to offset $34 billion in spending. It isn't that the conservatives want to be mean-spirited. It's that at the end- game, if the country is broke, everybody loses.\n\nMR. SANTELLI: All right. We're going to take a break here. We will pick up talking more about the Geithner interview, the economy and politics in our remaining moments with our roundtable -- don't go away -- right after this brief station break .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're back with our roundtable. So much to get to and, frankly, not enough time. But Santelli 's taking over your role. He's setting up the next topic beautifully, that segue artist that E.J. normally is. I want to talk about the economy and, and some of what Secretary Geithner said that I thought was, was pretty striking. But first, let me show you a couple of things. A poll from Bloomberg just about a week ago asking, \"Are you better off than you were 18 months ago?\" Look at that, 17 percent say yes; worse off, 29 percent; or about the same, 54 percent. That's after the stimulus plan.\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Polls suggest that an energized core of voters possibly around 40 percent has ideologically recoiled from Obama 's direction. That threatens Democrats , but their greater problem is that voters open to an activist government in principle are not convinced that it's producing enough benefits in practice,\" David Brooks . Government has not proven to be the answer, and yet that's the fundamental argument from the administration .\n\nRon Brownstein, in his column in the National Journal, says this in the political context: Right. There's been a, there's been a massive recall in the past year. The Obama administration has dropped about 20 percent among independent voters, in part because of the debt and other issues. But faith in government has plummeted back to its historic lows. Faith in Congress this week hit an 11 percent, an historic low forever. So how do you persuade people that you can do things when you have that kind of distrust, and that hasn't been solved? The stimulus obviously created some jobs. But the fact is, it's taken forever to get out; and the underlying reality is, the more the debt goes up, the more people are scared, and the more they're scared, especially small business , they're just not investing.\n\nMR. BROOKS: But, Rick Santelli , this is, again, and the liberal argument, which I brought up to Secretary Geithner , is, to challenge your point of view, \"Hey, wait a minute, you're raising the red flag about debt. Yes, they're unsustainable. But the cost of borrowing money right now is so low that, when you're in this kind of exigent circumstance economically, why not measure spending commensurate with the size of the, the financial hole we're in?\"\n\nMR. GREGORY: Let's cover three areas on that. First of all, when people get addicted to bad substances, usually the people that supply it give them really good prices in the early days. I don't think it's a great idea that we are enamored with the fact that we can sell so much debt, because it could all change very quickly. At the end of last year, a Greek six-month bond was around 2 percent. It's more than doubled, and it's only seven months into the year.\n\nMR. SANTELLI: We're not Greece ; we can print money .\n\nMR. GREGORY: We're not Greece yet, but that could be the ghost of the economy of the future if we stay on this unsustainable path. The other thing is, there's some of us out there that don't believe the stimulus or the recovery package or the TARP did what it sold. Matter of fact , my opinion would be that what we've done is we've created a six-day cure for a three-day flu.\n\nMR. SANTELLI: The issue of taxes , Anita Dunn , is front page on the morning papers today in\n\nMR. GREGORY: \"Battle looms on tax breaks \" as the Bush -era cuts are at issue. The New York Times , \"Next big battle in Washington : Bush 's tax cuts .\" If the administration is serious about cutting the deficit , why keep any of these tax cuts going? Because extending tax cuts to the middle class , those $250,000 -- $100,000 or less, is going to cost about $250 billion to do next year.\n\nThe Post and The Times. The Washington Post front page: David , the president was very clear, as a candidate in 2008 , as president in 2009 and 2010 , which is he believes that the middle class of this country pays enough in taxes and should not have a tax increase. He believes that they're stressed enough and that they're -- and that they lost ground over the last decade, and that he's not going to raise taxes on them.\n\nMS. DUNN: But let me just stop you...\n\nMR. GREGORY: He was very clear. But, no, but...\n\nMS. DUNN: Hold on, I want to stop you...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yeah.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...on this issue of tough choices because I pressed the...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right, uh-huh.\n\nMS. DUNN: ... Republicans on this. It is tough to say to the American people ...\n\nMR. GREGORY: Yes.\n\nMS. DUNN: ...\"I know you pay too much, but I can't do it now if I want to be serious about the deficit . Why not say to the American people , \"You got to sacrifice. We got to get rid of all these tax cuts if, if it's a bad idea,\" which is what Democrats believe, that the tax cuts were a bad idea.\n\nMR. GREGORY: No, Democrats didn't believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea. As a matter of fact , David , there were battles in 2001 and 2003 from Democrats to do things like double the Child Care Tax Credit to make the tax cuts more progressive at the bottom end. So they didn't believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea either in 2001 or in 2003 . What they did believe, and what they continue to believe, is that the, is that the very, very highest, and then the people who did the best, the 2 percent, 2 percent of the 300 million people in this country , that they can pay a little more during this time. But in terms of the deficit piece of this, the president is absolutely convinced and is taking steps . There is a bipartisan deficit commission -- and I know in Washington bipartisan commissions come and go -- but this is a very serious effort, and it will come back with recommendations, and there are going to be tough choices in there. The president's already directed his Cabinet agencies to cut their spending. There are going to be tough choices in there, and there have to be, because I think everyone recognizes that.\n\nMS. DUNN: I've got about three minutes left. E.J., you can weigh in on that, but I want to show -- the president spoke to the Netroots Conference over the weekend. So this is a developing story about the Obama agenda and some of the complaints from the left, and I just want to play a portion of that.\n\nMR. GREGORY: So, in ways large and small, we've begun to deliver on the change you fought so hard for. And we're not done. We're working to repeal \"Don't ask, Don't tell .\" We're working to close Guantanamo in a responsible way. And thanks to the heroism of our troops, we are poised to end our combat mission in Iraq by the end of August, completing a draw-down of more than 90,000 troops since I took office. We're moving America forward. And when we've come this far, we can't afford to slide backward.\n\nPRES. OBAMA: What's striking about that is that the president has a problem with independent voters, but he's also got those on the left who are pretty disappointed.\n\nMR. GREGORY: Right now you think that's important to the outcome of the election . I just want to say one thing on this tax issue. Warren Buffet very famously said that he pays tax at a lower rate than his receptionist. Because of the way we tax dividends and capital gains , the truly rich people in the country , according to a study last year, the 400 richest people, pay taxes at a lower rate, in effect, than firefighters, than police officers, than shop clerks. That's why we need to raise taxes on the very wealthy to cover the deficit . Because, guess what, the tax increases on the wealthy do not have an anti-stimulative effect the way tax cuts on average people do. Barack Obama was very smart to do that. He needed to do that. They're -- the Democrats are going to be in trouble if their own people don't turn out. Right now, Rick Santelli 's tea party has really motivated a lot of people on the right. The administration and Democrats have to do a lot more motivating on their side.\n\nMR. DIONNE: Let, let me get your thoughts about fiscal responsibility , but save me 30 seconds to talk about Charlie Rangel , OK?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Oh I -- Warren Buffet pays cap gains rates, which they're not going to raise. They're raising the rates as income tax rates. That doesn't matter. Listen, my view of the -- of fiscal policy and the economy is just not that strong. We've learned you can pump a lot of the money, you're not going to get short-term buzz. You should think long-term. What can we do long-term to get fair taxes , simple taxes , structure and innovation? So I, I think the idea we're going to fix the economy or fiscal policy in the next six months or a year, it's fallacious.\n\nMR. BROOKS: Marc Morial , can, can Charlie Rangel survive the ethics trouble he's in?\n\nMR. GREGORY: Last time I walked through the streets of Harlem , Charlie Rangel still has incredible support, and I think what this week tells us is, let's not pre-judge Charlie Rangel . Charlie Rangel has a right to be heard, and I think we need to hear his side of the story. He's a great congressman, he's a great American.\n\nMR. MORIAL: But, Anita Dunn , the last thing Democrats want right now is a full airing of ethics charges against one of their members when Congress rates it about 11 percent approval.\n\nMR. GREGORY: You're arguing it could go lower? No, here, I, I think that we have to think about what Marc Morial just said because the reality is we should listen to him in context before we judge.\n\nMS.

{"article": "By the way, Heritage is always like this. Whenever there\u2019s something the G.O.P. doesn\u2019t like \u2014 say, environmental protection \u2014 Heritage can be counted on to produce a report, based on no economic model anyone else recognizes, claiming that this policy would cause huge job losses. Correspondingly, whenever there\u2019s something Republicans want, like tax cuts for the wealthy or for corporations, Heritage can be counted on to claim that this policy would yield immense economic benefits.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe point is that the two parties don\u2019t just live in different moral universes, they also live in different intellectual universes, with Republicans in particular having a stable of supposed experts who reliably endorse whatever they propose.\n\nSo when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where\u2019s the common ground?\n\nEventually, of course, America must choose between these differing visions. And we have a way of doing that.

But last year the G.O.P. ran against what it called the \u201cmassive Medicare cuts\u201d contained in the health reform law. How, then, can the election have provided a mandate for a plan that not only would preserve all of those cuts, but would go on, over time, to dismantle Medicare completely?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, polls suggest that the public\u2019s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget. Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that\u2019s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.\n\nWhich brings me to those calls for a bipartisan solution. Sorry to be cynical, but right now \u201cbipartisan\u201d is usually code for assembling some conservative Democrats and ultraconservative Republicans \u2014 all of them with close ties to the wealthy, and many who are wealthy themselves \u2014 and having them proclaim that low taxes on high incomes and drastic cuts in social insurance are the only possible solution.\n\nThis would be a corrupt, undemocratic way to make decisions about the shape of our society even if those involved really were wise men with a deep grasp of the issues. It\u2019s much worse when many of those at the table are the sort of people who solicit and believe the kind of policy analyses that the Heritage Foundation supplies.\n\nSo let\u2019s not be civil. Instead, let\u2019s have a frank discussion of our differences. In particular, if Democrats believe that Republicans are talking cruel nonsense, they should say so \u2014 and take their case to the voters.", "comment_3": "Why It's Futile to Argue With a Liberal: by Peter Parisi A recent column by Paul Krugman, the uber-liberal New Y... http://bit.ly/iShevK", "comment_2": "@paulkrugman I dearly wish Krugman would note in tomorrow's column, illustrating the point by referencing the effec\u2026 https://t.co/AMcuS7WHEh", "comment_1": "Great column by NYT's Paul Krugman on the stubborn persistence of beliefs over evidence: http://t.co/KzzTo2IqbN", "target": "real"}

The times are too serious for this kind of politics. The calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great. So let me begin by offering my judgment about what we\u2019ve done, where we are, and where we need to go. Six years ago, I stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in Iraq, and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Senator McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that \u2013 as despicable as Saddam Hussein was \u2013 posed no imminent threat to the American people. Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al Qaeda\u2019s leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America\u2019s focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region. In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, I warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the Middle East, create new centers of terrorism, and tie us down in a costly and open-ended occupation. Senator McCain predicted that we\u2019d be greeted as liberators, and that the Iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues. For the good of our country, I wish he had been right, and I had been wrong. But that\u2019s not what history shows. Senator McCain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors, his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge. Let me once again praise General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker \u2013 they are outstanding Americans. In Iraq, gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military, the increasing capability of Iraq\u2019s Security Forces, the ceasefire of Shiite militias, and the decision taken by Sunni tribes to take the fight to al Qaeda. Those are the facts, and all Americans welcome them. But understand what the essential argument was about. Before the surge, I argued that the long-term solution in Iraq is political \u2013 the Iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future. That holds true today. We have lost over a thousand American lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars since the surge began, but Iraq\u2019s leaders still haven\u2019t made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country. Our military is badly overstretched \u2013 a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world. And while we pay a heavy price in Iraq \u2013 and Americans pay record prices at the pump \u2013 Iraq\u2019s government is sitting on a $79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits. Let\u2019s be clear: our troops have completed every mission they\u2019ve been given. They have created the space for political reconciliation. Now it must be filled by an Iraqi government that reconciles its differences and spends its oil profits to meet the needs of its people. Iraqi inaction threatens the progress we\u2019ve made and creates an opening for Iran and the \u201cspecial groups\u201d it supports. It\u2019s time to press the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. The best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades, carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground. We can safely redeploy at a pace that removes our combat brigades in 16 months. That would be well into 2010 \u2013 seven years after the war began. After this redeployment, we\u2019ll keep a residual force to target remnants of al Qaeda; to protect our service members and diplomats; and to train Iraq's Security Forces if the Iraqis make political progress. Iraq\u2019s democratically-elected Prime Minister has embraced this timeframe. Now it\u2019s time to succeed in Iraq by turning Iraq over to its sovereign government. We should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched. We should not keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq while Americans struggle in a sluggish economy. Ending the war will allow us to invest in America, to strengthen our military, and to finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and the border region of Pakistan. This is the central front in the war on terrorism. This is where the Taliban is gaining strength and launching new attacks, including one that just took the life of ten French soldiers. This is where Osama bin Laden and the same terrorists who killed nearly 3,000 Americans on our own soil are hiding and plotting seven years after 9/11. This is a war that we have to win. And as Commander-in-Chief, I will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten America, and finishing the job against the Taliban. For years, I have called for more resources and more troops to finish the fight in Afghanistan. With his overwhelming focus on Iraq, Senator McCain argued that we could just \u201cmuddle through\u201d in Afghanistan, and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month. Now, we need a policy of \u201cmore for more\u201d \u2013 more from America and our NATO allies, and more from the Afghan government. That's why I've called for at least two additional U.S. combat brigades and an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance for Afghanistan, with a demand for more action from the Afghan government to take on corruption and counternarcotics, and to improve the lives of the Afghan people. We must also recognize that we cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure America as long as there is a terrorist safe-haven in northwest Pakistan. A year ago, I said that we must take action against bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and Pakistan cannot or will not act. Senator McCain criticized me and claimed that I was for \u201cbombing our ally.\u201d So for all of his talk about following Osama bin Laden to the Gates of Hell, Senator McCain refused to join my call to take out bin Laden across the Afghan border. Instead, he spent years backing a dictator in Pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people. I argued for years that we need to move from a \u201cMusharraf policy\u201d to a \u201cPakistan policy.\u201d We must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man. Now, with President Musharraf\u2019s resignation, we have the opportunity to do just that. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve cosponsored a bill to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al Qaeda in the tribal regions of Pakistan. Today, our attention is also on the Republic of Georgia, and Senator McCain and I both strongly support the people of Georgia and the Americans delivering humanitarian aid. There is no possible justification for Russia\u2019s actions. Russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease-fire signed by their president, and we are hearing reports of Russian atrocities: burning wheat fields, brutal killing, and the destruction of Georgia\u2019s infrastructure and military assets. This crisis underscores the need for engaged U.S. leadership in the world. We failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted, our resources overstretched, and our alliances frayed. American leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that we\u2019re not merely responding to them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to renewing our leadership and rebuilding our alliances as President of the United States. For months, I have called for active international engagement to resolve the disputes over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. I made it crystal clear before, at the beginning of, and during this conflict that Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity must be respected, and that Georgia should be integrated into transatlantic institutions. I have condemned Russian aggression, and today I reiterate my demand that Russia abide by the cease-fire. Russia must know that its actions will have consequences. They will imperil the Civil Nuclear Agreement, and Russia\u2019s standing in the international community \u2013 including the NATO-Russia Council, and Russia\u2019s desire to participate in organizations like the WTO and the OECD. Finally, we must help Georgia rebuild what has been destroyed. That is why I\u2019m proud to join my friend, Senator Joe Biden, in calling for an additional $1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of Georgia. These are the judgments I\u2019ve made and the policies that we have to debate, because we do have differences in this election. But one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people can\u2019t disagree without challenging each other\u2019s character and patriotism. I have never suggested that Senator McCain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition. I have not suggested it because I believe that he genuinely wants to serve America\u2019s national interest. Now, it\u2019s time for him to acknowledge that I want to do the same. Let me be clear: I will let no one question my love of this country. I love America, so do you, and so does John McCain. When I look out at this audience, I see people of different political views. You are Democrats and Republicans and Independents. But you all served together, and fought together, and bled together under the same proud flag. You did not serve a Red America or a Blue America \u2013 you served the United States of America. So let\u2019s have a serious debate, and let\u2019s debate our disagreements on the merits of policy \u2013 not personal attacks. And no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run, I will honor Senator McCain\u2019s service, just like I honor the service of every veteran in this room, and every American who has worn the uniform of the United States. One of those Americans was my grandfather, Stanley Dunham. My father left when I was 2, so my grandfather was the man who helped raise me. He grew up in El Dorado, Kansas \u2013 a town too small to warrant boldface on a road map. He worked on oil rigs and drifted from town to town during the Depression. Then he met my grandmother and enlisted after Pearl Harbor. He would go on to march across Europe in Patton\u2019s Army, while my great uncle fought with the 89th Infantry Division to liberate Buchenwald, my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line, and my mother was born at Fort Leavenworth. After my grandfather left the Army, he went to college on the GI Bill, bought his home with help from the Federal Housing Authority, and he and my grandmother moved west in a restless pursuit of their dreams. They were among the men and women of our Greatest Generation. They came from ordinary places, and went on to do extraordinary things. They survived a Depression and faced down fascism. And when the guns fell silent, America stood by them, because they had a government that didn\u2019t just ask them to win a war \u2013 it helped them to live their dreams in peace, and to become the backbone of the largest middle class that the world has ever known. In the five years after World War II, the GI Bill helped 15 million veterans get an education. Two million went to college. Millions more learned a trade in factories or on farms. Four million veterans received help in buying a home, leading to the biggest home construction boom in our history. And these veterans didn\u2019t just receive a hand from Washington \u2013 they did their part to lift up America, just as they\u2019d done their duty in defending it. They became teachers and doctors, cops and firefighters who were the foundation of our communities. They became the innovators and small business owners who helped drive the American economy. They became the scientists and engineers who helped us win the space race against the Soviets. They won a Cold War, and left a legacy to their children and grandchildren who reached new horizons of opportunity. I am a part of that legacy. Without it, I would not be standing on this stage today. And as President, I will do everything that I can to keep the promise, to advance the American Dream for all our veterans, and to enlist them in the cause of building a stronger America. Our young men and women in uniform have proven that they are the equal of the Greatest Generation on the battlefield. Now, we must ensure that our brave troops serving abroad today become the backbone of our middle class at home tomorrow. Those who fight to defend America abroad must have the chance to live their dreams at home \u2013 through education and their ability to make a good living; through affordable health care; and through a retirement that is dignified and secure. That is the promise that we must keep with all who serve. It starts with those who choose to remain in uniform, as well as their families. My wife Michelle has net with military families in North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia over the last several months. Every time, she passes on their stories \u2013 stories of lives filled with patriotism and purpose, but also stories of spouses struggling to pay the bills, kids dealing with an absent parent, and the unique burden of multiple deployments. The message that Michelle has heard is what you all know and have lived: when a loved one is deployed, the whole family goes to war. The VFW has done an extraordinary job of standing by our military families \u2013 helping out with everything from a phone card for a soldier who is overseas, to an extra hand around the house. As President, I will stand with you. We need a Military Families Advisory Board to identify new ways to ease the burden. We need more official support for the volunteer networks that help military spouses get by. And we need to make sure that military pay does not lag behind the private sector, so that those who serve can raise their families and live the life they\u2019ve earned. For those who return to civilian life, I will support their American Dream in this 21st century just as we supported generations of veterans in the 20th. That starts with education. Everyone who serves this country should have the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the GI Bill. That\u2019s why, unlike my opponent, I was a strong and early supporter of Jim Webb\u2019s GI Bill for the 21st Century \u2013 a bill that Senator McCain called too generous. At a time when the skyrocketing cost of tuition is pricing thousands of Americans out of a college education, this bill provides every veteran with a real chance to afford a world-class college education. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll continue to stand up for as President. We must also stand up for affordable health care for every single veteran. That's why I've pledged to build a 21st century VA. We need to cut through the red tape \u2013 every service-member should get electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge. We need to close shortfalls \u2013 it\u2019s time to fully fund VA health care, and to add more Vet Centers. We need to get rid of means-testing - every veteran should be allowed into the VA system. My opponent takes a different view. He wants to ration care so the VA only serves combat injuries, while everyone else gets an insurance card. While the VA needs some real reform to better serve those who have worn the uniform, privatization is just not the answer. We cannot risk our veterans\u2019 health care by turning the VA into just another health insurer. We need to make sure the VA is strong enough to treat every veteran who depends on it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as President. And we must expand and enhance our ability to identify and treat PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury at all levels: from enlistment, to deployment, to civilian life. No one should suffer in silence, or slip through the cracks in the system. That's why I've passed measures to increase screening for these unseen wounds, and helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from them. This is something I\u2019ve fought for in the Senate, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ll make a priority as President. Economic security for our veterans also depends on revamping an overburdened benefits system. I congratulate the VFW for what you\u2019ve done to help veterans navigate a broken VBA bureaucracy. Now it\u2019s time for the government to do a better job. We need more workers, and a 21st century electronic system that is fully linked up to military records and the VA\u2019s health network. It\u2019s time to ensure that those who\u2019ve served get the benefits that they\u2019ve earned. Just as we give veterans the support they deserve, we must also engage them and all Americans in a new cause: renewing America. I am running for President because I believe that there is no challenge too great for the American people to meet if they are called upon to come together. In America, each of us is free to seek our dreams, but we must also serve a common purpose, a higher purpose. No one embodies that commitment like a veteran. Just think of the skills that our troops have developed through their service. They have not simply waged war in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 they have rebuilt infrastructure, supported new agriculture, trained police forces, and developed health care systems. For those leaving military service, it\u2019s time to apply those skills to our great national challenges here at home. That means expanding programs like Troops-to-Teachers that put veterans at the front of the classroom. That means tapping the talent of engineers who\u2019ve served as we make a substantial investment to rebuild our infrastructure and create millions of new jobs. That means dramatically expanding national service programs to give Americans of all ages, skills and stations the chance to give back to their communities and their country. I\u2019ll also enlist veterans in forging a new American energy economy. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a Green Veterans initiative to give our veterans the training they need to succeed in the Green Jobs of the future \u2013 so that they put themselves on a pathway to a successful career, while ensuring that our national security is never held hostage to hostile nations. This is how we can help our veterans live their dreams while helping our country meet the challenges of the 21st century. And this is what we have learned from so many generations of veterans, including those of you here today \u2013 that your contribution to the American story does not end when the uniform comes off. We need those who serve in our military to live their dreams \u2013 and to continue serving the cause of America \u2013 when the guns fall silent. That\u2019s what the VFW stands for, and if I have the honor of being your President, that\u2019s what my Administration will work for every single day. Because I believe that we have a sacred trust with those who serve in our military. That trust is simple: America will be there for you just as you have been there for America. It\u2019s a trust that begins at enlistment, and it never ends. I thought of that trust last week when I visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial. I saw where the bombs fell on the USS Arizona, and where a war began that would reshape the world order while reshaping the lives of all who served in it \u2013 from our great generals and admirals, to the enlisted men like my grandfather. Then I visited his grave at the Punchbowl, the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. I still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest. In a cemetery lined with the graves of Americans who have sacrificed for our country, we heard the solemn notes of Taps and the crack of guns fired in salute; we watched as a folded flag was handed to my grandmother and my grandfather was laid to rest. It was a nation's final act of service and gratitude to Stanley Dunham - an America that stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform, and never left his side. This is what we owe our troops and our veterans. Because in every note of Taps and in every folded flag, we hear and see an unwavering belief in the idea of America. The idea that no matter where you come from, or what you look like, or who your parents are, this is a place where anything is possible; where anyone can make it; where we look out for each other, and take care of each other; where we rise and fall as one nation - as one people. It's an idea that's worth fighting for - an idea for which so many Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. Now it falls to us to advance that idea just as so many generations have before.\n\n", "comment_3": "twaboutMCCAIN&gt; d: The Long Run - Response to 9/11 Offers Outline of McCain Doctrin.. http://tinyurl.com/5w85t7", "comment_2": "The Long Run - Response to 9/11 Offers Outline of McCain Doctrine, http://pawst.com/post/243536", "comment_1": "d: The Long Run - Response to 9/11 Offers Outline of McCain Doctrine - Series - NYTimes.com http://tinyurl.com/6qyl5r", "target": "real"}
{"article": "Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit\n\nThursday, March 22, 2007\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact: Ben LaBolt\n\nWASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market.\n\nThe text of the letter is below:\n\nDear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson,\n\nThere is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures. Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.\n\nWorking together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody\u2019s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.\n\nThe summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators\u2019 Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:\n\nWhat standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.\n\nHow to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.\n\nHow to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.\n\nHow to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.\n\nHow to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.\n\nHow to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.\n\nOf course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.\n\nNevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don\u2019t let this opportunity pass us by.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama", "comment_3": "March 22, 2007 Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit http://is.gd/3Dtg he gets it!", "comment_2": "1997, Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit,http://tinyurl.com/3zpqwy", "comment_1": "1997, Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit,http://tinyurl.com/3zpqwy", "target": "real"}
{"article": "The only budget Ted Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nMarco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.\n\n\"He talks tough on some of these issues,\" Rubio said Dec. 13. \"For example, he was going to \u2018carpet bomb\u2019 ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.\n\nWe decided to fact-check Rubio\u2019s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.\n\nCruz\u2019s vote on Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Cruz\u2019s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul\u2019s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Paul\u2019s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:\n\n\"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\"\n\nUnder Paul\u2019s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.\n\nWas Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?\n\nSo why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\n\n\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.\n\nBut experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\n\n\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.\n\nChristopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\n\n\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\n\n\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"\n\nBenjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\n\n\"This was a budget, so it doesn\u2019t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul\u2019s plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul\u2019s proposal for defense was below Obama\u2019s request.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "comment_3": "Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal https://t.co/3owngPNaUq", "comment_2": "Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul's budget proposal https://t.co/yXWTnUD4Kd", "comment_1": "Marco #Rubio says Ted #Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul's budget proposal https://t.co/4hBVxWLaXS via @PolitiFactFL", "target": "real"}

{"article": "CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump\u2019s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump\u2019s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that \u201cPresident\u201d Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump \ufffd?s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trump\u2019s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump\u2019s support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story.
